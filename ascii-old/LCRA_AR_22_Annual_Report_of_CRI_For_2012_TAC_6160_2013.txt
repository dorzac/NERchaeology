Management Summary

In June 2010, the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) entered into a new memorandum of
understanding (MOU) with the Texas Historical Commission (THC) under which LCRA is granted
permission under the Antiquities Code of Texas to conduct cultural resources assessments for LCRA
construction projects. The new MOU replaced a previous memorandum of understanding that the
agencies had entered into in May 2005. The new MOU allows the LCRA archaeology team to conduct
construction monitoring, archaeological surface reconnaissance and intensive cultural resource surveys on
new and existing tracts, facilities, transmission lines and substations 300 acres or less in size under
authorization of a yearly blanket Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) Antiquities Permit issued for the
calendar year. Such projects are submitted to THC through interim reports that THC reviews and
comments on during a 30-day review process. These reports are then finalized and included in the
Annual Report.
There are now three notable exceptions to these Standard Review and Reporting Procedures. The first is
for small (less than five acres in size), negative (no archaeological sites present) field surveys. The results
of such projects are summarized in memo form for LCRA project managers and then compiled in the
Annual Report for ex post facto THC review.
The second is for maintenance projects that involve routine and/or periodic potentially ground-disturbing
activities in areas that have been previously disturbed by initial construction or through a history of
similar activities. These are primarily for transmission line rights of way (ROW) but may also include
fence repair and replacement, prescribed burns, and existing fire lane and road maintenance. Such
projects receive at minimum a file review that evaluates previous levels of investigation and locations of
previously identified sites that are potentially eligible or listed as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs).
If warranted, such projects will also undergo field surveys that will typically focus on high-probability
areas where ground disturbance is expected. Recommendations for any site or ground disturbance
avoidance areas are then communicated to LCRA project managers in memo form and likewise compiled
in the Annual Report for after the fact THC review.
The third exception is for projects that occur in previously disturbed areas of existing LCRA-owned lands
and LCRA ROW easements, including (1) electrical substations, (2) power plants, (3) water and
wastewater treatment plants, (4) routine structural maintenance of existing electrical transmission poles
and (5) pipeline repair or replacement in existing trenches. Under the new MOU, such projects do not
require review by the THC. However, LCRA project managers must coordinate with LCRA
archaeologists early in the planning stage to ensure that no SALs or sites that are eligible (or potentially
eligible) for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) are present in the new
construction areas and that the new construction areas have indeed been previously disturbed.
Other projects reviewed by LCRA archaeologists do not require an archaeological survey, typically
because they are in low-probability areas or have been previously evaluated. In such cases, letters are
sent to the THC reviewer explaining the rationale for such recommendations. As with interim reports,

i

THC reviews and comments on these within a 30-day review period. These letters are also included in
the Annual Report.
From January 1 through December 31, 2012, LCRAâs Cultural Resource Services staff conducted file
searches, field reconnaissance, intensive survey-level cultural resource investigations and archaeological
monitoring for 41 projects under Antiquities Permit No. 6160. These were conducted in 23 counties,
primarily along the Colorado River and the central part of the Edwards Plateau, but also in south-central,
southeast and west Texas. A total of 3,746.94 acres was assessed, and 1,343.11 acres were actually
surveyed. That included about 1,052 acres of a summary report of multiple years of investigations at
LCRAâs Turkey Bend Recreation Area. Projects greater than 300 acres in size or those that involved
testing or mitigation through excavation were conducted under separate permits either by LCRA staff or
consultants and are reported upon separately.
Twenty-one previously unrecorded archaeological sites were recorded as a result of the projects
summarized within this annual report. In total there were 20 prehistoric components and six historic
components. An additional 128 previously recorded sites with 119 prehistoric components and 19
historic components were assessed in regard to specific projects. Of all 149 assessed sites, 47 were
considered to be potentially eligible for formal listing as State Archeological Landmarks (SAL), four
were considered to be eligible, and one was listed. The listed site was 41SS113, located in LCRAâs San
Saba River Nature Park. Sites 41BT391, 41TV1850, 41TV2360 and 41TV2361, which are all prehistoric
sites located in LCRAâs Turkey Bend Recreation Area, are assessed as eligible for formal SAL
designation . Site 41TV1850 is a burned rock midden with deposits of at least 50 cm thickness while the
other three prehistoric sites are prehistoric campsites with stratified deposits including a noteworthy
deeply buried cultural zone seen at 4.5 m below ground surface at 41TV2361.
Twenty-four other prehistoric sites at the Turkey Bend Recreation Area are considered potentially SAL
eligible or of unknown SAL eligibility. These prehistoric sites cover a broad array of site types that could
be utilized for settlement patterning and landscape studies. Additionally, two historic sites at Turkey
Bend are believed to be on unknown SAL eligibility including site 41BT 322 where an 1860âs era
Masonic Lodge may have been located. Site 41GU142, another site of unknown SAL eligibility, was
found during the staffâs survey of the Cushman to Hwy 123 Transmission Line and Substation Additional
Project in Guadalupe County. Portions of this site within the originally proposed transmission line rightof-way appeared to contain buried prehistoric campsite deposits that may have good contextual integrity.
A plan has been formulated to avoid impacts to this site. Overall, these sites of unknown SAL eligibility
appear to have additional research or interpretive potential, but without further investigations,
determinations cannot be made. These sites are typically recommended for avoidance and protection
from construction and other impacts.
Collections of artifacts were made from Project 3.12 (the City of Goldthwaite Water Pipeline at San Saba
River Nature Park Survey), Project 7.12 (the Turkey Bend Recreation Area Survey), Project 21.12 (the
Camp Chautauqua Tree Removal Project) and Project 22.12 (the Cedar Point Brush Clearing Project).
These artifacts have all been curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL).

The following is a list of sites that were assessed during the calendar year, and can also be found
associated with specific projects in Table 1. Following each trinomial is an âHâ and/or a âPâ designating
historic and prehistoric components. Sites with a single asterisk are considered to have an unknown
eligibility for SAL status, two asterisks indicate the site is considered to be SAL eligible, and three
asterisks are for sites that are listed as SALs. Sites without asterisks are considered to be not eligible for
formal SAL status.

Introduction
From January 1 through December 31, 2012, LCRAâs Archaeology Services staff conducted file searches,
field reconnaissance, intensive survey-level cultural resource investigations and archaeological
monitoring for 41 projects within LCRAâs traditional statutory district and service area (Figure 1)
reportable to the Texas Historical Commission. These cultural resource investigations were conducted by
LCRA Archaeology Services staff members Daniel J. Prikryl and Andrew F. Malof with the aid of
contracted archaeologists Charles A. Hixson and Pat Hatten under the authorization of Texas Antiquities
Permit Number 6160. Mr. Prikryl, Mr. Malof and Mr. Hixson were the principal investigators under this
permit.

Environmental Background
Introduction
From its headwaters on the Llano Estacado near Lamesa, Texas, the Colorado River flows 864 river miles
to its mouth at Matagorda Bay, a watershed that for millennia has been the major source of water for
Central Texas and portions of the Coastal Plain (Figure 2). It has provided prehistoric and historic Native
Americans as well as historic pioneers with the resources necessary to sustain life. The effects of
environmental change on the river and its resources have a concomitant impact on the people who are
dependent on those resources. Subsequent change can be reflected in the settlement patterns or in the
tools prehistoric people used to process the various food resources. Research of the landscape and
cultural evolution along the river is a goal of LCRA. The information in some areas is more abundant
than in others, the result of differential research. This section provides a brief physiographic background
for the Colorado River within the 10-county LCRA statutory district from San Saba County in the Llano
Uplift Region to Matagorda County on the Gulf Coastal Plain (Figure 1). Subsequent sections focus on
the ancient and modern people who depended on the river for sustenance.
Physiography and Geology
The Colorado River flows in a generally southeasterly direction crosscutting bands of geologic deposits
generally oriented on northeast-southwest lines. Along its course through the LCRA statutory district, it
crosscuts three major physiographic zones: the Llano Uplift, the Hill Country and the Gulf Coastal Plain
(Sellards et al. 1932: Figures 3 and 4).
The Llano Uplift. As the Colorado River enters San Saba County at the northwest boundary of the LCRA
statutory district, it intersects Paleozoic Era formations of sandstone, limestone and shale of
Pennsylvanian and Mississippian ages (Arbingast et al. 1976:11). Beginning about midway in the county
and into Burnet and Llano counties, the river traverses billion-year-old Precambrian Era igneous and
metamorphic formations of the Llano Uplift region (Fisher 1981). Granite, schist, and gneiss are a few of
the rocks observed in the region. The Llano Uplift region has very rugged topography with elevations
that range from 1,500 ft above mean sea level (ft msl) to 825 ft ft msl along the river. High points are
Packsaddle Mountain, Backbone Ridge, Long Mountain and the Riley Mountains. Black (1989:7)
observed that Packsaddle schist and granite were used by prehistoric aboriginal groups in Central Texas.
Grave offerings made from the schist were reported at a cemetery site downstream on the coastal plain in
Austin County along the Brazos River (Hall 1981). Granite cobbles from the river were favored for use as
grinding stones (Johnson 1991) and observed by the authors at sites in the Hill Country and at the
Kingsland site (41BT215). Gravels deposited during Pleistocene floods cover earlier deposits in some
areas along ancient flood terraces. The gravels provided prehistoric people with cobble chert and
quartzite for stone tools.
The Edwards Plateau/Hill Country. Continuing its meandering course, the river traverses Cretaceous
limestone deposits in Burnet and Travis counties (Fisher 1974 and 1981). The area is classified as the
Hill Country, a subprovince of the Edwards Plateau (Woodruff 1975:4). Woodruff (1975:4) describes the
area as â.... an area of high relief, steep slopes, and high stream dissection that occurs between the
3

Figure 2. Major physiographic/natural regions of Texas with locations of counties investigated during
2012

Balcones Escarpment on the east and the contiguous Edwards Plateau farther westâ. Elevations do not
change radically from the preceding reaches. The formations can contain nodular and tabular chert. The
prized chert of the Edwards Limestone formation provided highly workable raw material for the
manufacture of prehistoric chipped stone tools. In addition, the gravels deposited during Pleistocene
floods that mantle earlier deposits in some areas along ancient flood terraces provided prehistoric people
with cobble chert and quartzite for stone tools. The Balcones Escarpment marks the southern boundary of
the Edwards Plateau and the southeastern boundary of the Hill Country
From this point, the limestone dips southeast and under younger sandstones. From the edge of the
escarpment, the river continues its course onto the geologically younger Gulf Coastal Plain. Given the
resistant nature of the geologic formations in the Hill Country and Llano Uplift regions, it is probable that
the river entrenched early in time, forming steep-sided, narrow canyons in some areas (Looney and Baker
1977:323). This is not the case along the lower channel on the Coastal Plain where the river has
frequently meandered and rechanneled in the less resistant formations.
The Gulf Coastal Plain. The Blackland Prairie represents the first surface unit traversed by the river at the
interior end of the Gulf Coastal Plain. Situated at the base of the Balcones Escarpment, the Blackland
Prairie is a northeast-southwest trending geographic province (Arbingast et al. 1976:12). The Blackland
Prairie has relatively flat topography, and its surface geology consists of Cretaceous-aged clay and marl.
As the river continues through Bastrop, Fayette and Colorado counties, it has incised a channel into
Eocene- and Miocene-A age sandstones and clays, leaving behind ancient floodplain terraces (see Caran
et al. 1992). Radiocarbon dating of a volcanic ash zone in one of the older upper floodplain terraces near
the town of Smithville in Bastrop County indicates terrace development prior to the 620,000 BP (before
present) date (Caran et al. 1992:3-4). The ash is a Middle Pleistocene windblown deposit from volcanoes
in the Yellowstone area. The uplands are hilly in places with gentle slopes. Elevations range from 500 ft
ft msl in the uplands to 350 feet ft msl along the river banks. Gravel deposits along the river in Bastrop
and Fayette counties are millions of years old. The earlier gravels (i.e., deposited during the late Tertiary
Period) were deposited by large ancient river courses transporting gravels in the channel from as far away
as the Rockies. Now these same erosion-resistant gravels mantle river basin and tributary divides.
Referred to in some areas as Uvalde Gravels (Byrd 1971), they provided prehistoric man with a source of
usable chert and quartzite for chipped stone tools.
The outer bands of the Gulf Coastal Plain in Colorado, Wharton and Matagorda counties are composed of
relatively flat clayey Pleistocene surfaces of the Beaumont Formation and other fluviatile terraces. Relief
is minimal with elevations ranging from 10-40 feet ft msl in the uplands to 5-10 feet ft msl on the flats
near the river channel. Gravel deposits are scarce. Prehistorically, this resulted in an adaptation to other
types of material for tools such as shell and bone. On the outer plain where the Pleistocene Beaumont
clays predominate, a high incidence of megafauna remains (e.g., mammoth, camel, mastodon, bison,
sloth) has been observed and specimens collected from the clays at places such as the mouth of the Sabine
River (Long 1997). Paleoindian artifacts dating to 12,000 years ago have been found on the nearby beach
(Long 1977).

Soils
Except along the Colorado River floodplain where aggrading alluvium has formed terraces, soils along
the river uplands bespeak the underlying strata or parent material. Numerous Soil Conservation Service
soil series describe the consistency of the various soil groups.
In the Llano Uplift area, upland soils can be formed from decomposing granitic and decomposed organic
material (e.g., leaves, bark, berries, cedar duff). The sandy granitic soils contain particles of mica, quartz
and schists (constituents of the granite). At 41BT215 (the Kingsland site), some of the sandy granitic
soils have been redeposited down slope by runoff (colluvial redeposition). Near the base of the slope
where the soils have been redeposited, the river has flooded and deposited sediments. The combination
has left alternating bands of alluvial and colluvial deposits.
In the limestone country of the Hill Country, the soils are deep to shallow and predominantly consist of
stony calcareous clays and clay loams that formed from parent limestone, marl and organic humic
deposits. In some places where erosion has exposed limestone bedrock, the soils are pocketed on
erosional benches. Because these clay and clay loam soils are non-acidic, bone and charcoal are better
preserved in archaeological deposits.
On the Gulf Coastal Plain, topsoils are variable and mimic the underlying geologic formations. Beginning
with the Blackland Prairie on the interior edge of the Gulf Coastal Plain, clay and clay loam topsoils are
derived from the underlying limestone, marl and clay surface geologic formations. Downstream from the
Blackland Prairie, sandy to fine sandy loams occur in areas underlain by various Eocene and Miocene
sandstone bedrock formations. Further southeastward, clay loam and clay topsoils are found adjacent to
the Gulf of Mexico in the Coast Prairies of Wharton and Matagorda counties.
Vegetation
Changes in the vegetation along the Colorado River correspond with changes in soils and bedrock
geology. McMahan et al. (1984) describe the various vegetal classifications. The descriptions presented
by the authors include dominant as well as understory species. To more fully understand the
classifications, two physiognomic classes need definition:
1. Parks - Woody plants mostly equal to or greater than 9-ft tall, generally dominant and growing in
clusters, or as scattered individuals within continuous grass or forbs (11 to 70 percent woody canopy
cover overall).
2. Woods - Woody plants mostly 9-to-30-ft tall with closed crowns or nearly so (71 to 100 percent canopy
cover); midstory usually lacking (McMahan et al. 1984:2).
The Llano Uplift Region is characterized by Live Oak - Mesquite Parks, where overstory species include
post oak, blackjack oak, cedar elm and black hickory. Understory species include buffalo grass, curly
mesquite, little bluestem and Texas winter grass. These species mainly grow in granitic soils.

6

In the Hill Country the vegetation ranges from Live Oak - Ashe Juniper Parks to Live Oak - Mesquite Ashe Juniper Parks, where overstory species include live oak, Texas oak, shin oak, and cedar elm with
understory species such as agarito, flameleaf sumac, Texas pricklypear, little bluestem, Texas winter
grass and curly mesquite. These species are mainly found on level to gently rolling uplands and ridge
tops.
Along the edge of the Balcones Escarpment, the vegetation is referred to as Live Oak - Ashe Juniper
Woods. Overstory species are the same as in the preceding categories, with some different understory
species such as evergreen sumac, twistleaf yucca and escarpment cherry. Species are mainly found in
shallow limestone soils in the hills and escarpment.
On the coastal plain, the original vegetation of the Blackland Prairie was bunch and short grasses
(Arbingast et al. 1976:13) with narrow riparian zones restricted to the flanks of stream channels. Much of
the Blackland Prairie was placed into crop production during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. As a
result, only occasional remnants of the original prairie grasslands have survived. East of the Blackland
Prairie, a Post Oak Woods/Forest with Grassland mosaic is found in the Post Oak Savannah. Overstory in
these areas is post oak, blackjack oak, eastern red cedar, mesquite, black hickory, cedar elm and
hackberry. Understory species include little bluestem, silver bluestem, dewberry and yaupon.
Anomalous to the area are stands of loblolly pine mixed with post oak in Bastrop County. Along the
coastal prairies in Wharton and Matagorda counties, the original vegetation consisted of coarse and coarse
bunch grasses and marsh and salt grasses. The development of croplands in the historic period has altered
the vegetation regime in many parts of this region.

Archaeological Background
Introduction
The portion of LCRAâs 10-county statutory district from its upstream end in San Saba County down into
central Bastrop County falls within a region defined as the Central Texas Culture Area during prehistoric
times (Prewitt 1981). Downstream eastward from the vicinity of Bastrop to Wharton, prehistoric remains
show influences from both Central and Coastal Texas during certain prehistoric periods (Skelton 1977).
At least one attempt to define an East Central Texas prehistoric culture area within the Post Oak
Savannah region has been made (Goode 1984). However, aside from the fact that burned rock midden
sites are restricted to the Hill Country area, prehistoric archeological materials from the Paleoindian and
Archaic periods in East Central Texas and along the coastal portions of the Colorado River drainage are
generally similar to those found in Central Texas Culture Area. For this reason, the prehistoric Culture
History Section that follows heavily utilizes the well-established Central Texas chronology. In the Late
Prehistoric section, however, the cultural remains along the coast are discussed separately from those
inland, as a distinctive Late Prehistoric cultural tradition is evident on the coast from the Bay City area
down to the coastal shoreline (including barrier islands) beginning approximately A. D. 1000. Last of all,
the authors recognize the merits of Ellis et alâs (1995) argument that the traditional Central Texas
prehistoric cultural sequence summary typically presented in archeological reports glosses over the wide
range of environmental diversity and the full range of hunter-gatherer adaptations and processes.
However, it is beyond the scope of this report to adequately detail the full range of such prehistoric
adaptations and cultural processes along the lower Colorado River.

Prehistoric
First evidence of human occupations in Central Texas dates to what is known as the Paleoindian period.
This period is defined as prior to 8500 BP. The Paleoindian period has been divided into two distinct
periods (Collins 1995: 376, Table 2), with the earlier Clovis, Folsom and Plainview cultures present at
11,500 BP. These early people are typically thought to have subsisted on varieties of big game: the
Clovis on mammoth and extinct forms of bison, the Folsom and Plainview on bison. New evidence is
suggesting that this view is in error, and that these people utilized the big game when necessary or
advantageous, but subsisted on a substantial percentage of smaller game as well (Collins 1995:381). This
early Paleoindian period was followed by a Late Paleoindian period, which has subsumed portions of
Prewittâs Early Archaic. For example, the Golondrina style point, placed in the Early Archaic by Prewitt,
has been placed in the late Paleoindian period by Collins (1995:376) based on distinctive features such as
edge grinding and size. Lifeways, however, seem to indicate a more archaic lifestyle (Collins 1995:382).
This has been termed a transitional period, with Paleoindian strategies slowly giving way to broaderbased pursuits of the relatively more sedentary hunter-gatherers of the Archaic (Johnson 1989:52).
The entire Central Texas Archaic spans some 7,500 years, from ca. 8500 BP to around 1250 BP. It can be
characterized generally as a time of increasing human populations adapting within a fluctuating but
generally warming climate. Following Collins (1995) the Early Archaic begins around 8500 BP and lasts
until 6000 BP. The Middle Archaic follows and lasts until around 4000 BP, followed by the Late Archaic
I to 2500 BP, and the Late Archaic II, to about 1200 BP. The Late Prehistoric, or as Johnson now refers
to it, the Post Archaic, follows, and here the phases mentioned earlier seem to hold fairly well, with
Austin Phase peoples around until about 800 BP, when a seemingly true cultural horizon (Johnson 1994),
the Toyah Phase, began.
Foraging cultures are immediately dependent upon natural resources for subsistence. It follows that much
information about lifeways can be gathered if ecological conditions can be ascertained. Collins et al.
(1993) and Johnson (1995) have both examined lines of evidence to suggest warming and cooling trends,
and these are both through the proxy of moisture, as temperature is very difficult to determine. Collins et
al. depend heavily on pollen analysis, which provides information on plant regimes from which climatic
data can be extrapolated. Johnson utilizes various lines of data, including pollen and microfauna from
buried contexts at Halls Cave, and also dated evidence of aggradation or lack thereof of stream side
terraces, with the assumption being that surfaces aggrade (or deflate) during wetter times but remain
stable during drier times. Their interpretations agree very closely for the Middle and Late Archaic, but
are in direct opposition during much of the Early Archaic. Collins is also somewhat more conservative,
avoiding some of the fine-grained peaks and valleys seen in Johnsonâs reconstruction (Collins 1995:Table
2, Johnson 1995:Figure 35).
The Early Archaic was a time when persons were having to adapt to the widespread extinction of the
large animals that had existed during the preceding Paleoindian Period. Although the big game hunting
nomadic lifeway has been shown to be largely a stereotype, mobility was probably high and populations
relatively low (Collins 1995:381, Johnson 1989). This basic way of life extended into the first part of the
Early Archaic. Dart points are described as Early Split Stem and include the Gower type first defined at
the Youngsport Site (Shafer 1963). Johnson has determined the period was relatively moist (Johnson
8

1995:Figure 35), while Collins shows it as fairly dry (Collins 1995:Table 2). Both indicate that the
beginning and end of the period were opposite what they showed for the majority, i.e., a peak of either
dryness or wetness at about the middle of the period. Evidence suggests that there were no bison during
this time (Collins 1995:383).
The question of bison presence or absence is very significant for understanding human behavior. Bison,
and to a lesser degree antelope, prefer open grasslands and prairies, and are also social animals, traveling
in large herds. The habits of these large-bodied mammals can be contrasted with the largely solitary
habits of woodland-preferring deer. In most cases bison would be considered to have high return rates,
tempered to some extent by high processing costs. The results would be evident in scheduling, mobility,
and technology of prehistoric people. In general, bison could be expected in tall grass prairies as opposed
to, for instance, oak savannas. Increases in available moisture favors tall grass over short grass, but also
can result in replacement of grasslands by woods. Johnson suggests that bison favored dry conditions in
Central Texas (Johnson 1995:86). Collins indicates bison were present in both wet and dry conditions,
and it is difficult to derive any patterns from his projected data (Collins 1995:Table 2). The strongest
correlation is between moisture-loving microfauna at Halls Cave and a long period of bison presence
through the Late Archaic. At other times bison are seen when all other indicators are of dry conditions.
Perhaps the best explanation comes from Ellis et al.âs (1995) discussion of environmental diversity.
Differential change on a micro- or meso-scale favored bison presence or absence on a scale too finegrained to be reasonably compared with broader climatic shifts.
The Middle Archaic shows climatic conditions of Collins and Johnson coming into fairly close alignment.
Both agree that there was an initial period of fairly mesic conditions followed by a period of drying.
Johnson sees a relatively mild and slow-paced change, while Collins sees an almost catastrophic drought.
Regardless, it is at this time that rock features, designed in the Early Archaic for efficient control of fireproduced heat, expand in function and complexity, coinciding with a spread of xerophytes from the west
due to drying conditions, and resulting in the burned rock middens that begin to be seen (or at least are
more common) during the end of the Middle Archaic (Collins 1995:384, Prewitt 1991:26).
Projectiles in the first part of this period are thin, broad-bladed Bell/Andice/Calf Creek types, deeply
notched points that are believed to have been used both for hunting based on impact breaks, and as
knives, as seen in microwear analysis. This is consistent with a specialized hunting economy, and the
apparent bison presence at that time would be an obvious target of a multipurpose projectile/knife
(Collins 1995:384). The disappearance of bison coincides with the replacement of these types with
narrow, thick, heavy Travis and Nolan points. Johnson sees precursors of the bison tool assemblage
coming in from the Plains, and precursors of these latter points perhaps from the Lower Pecos, in the form
of Pandale points (Johnson 1995:88). This is suggestive, as the Plains would of course have had bison,
while they were largely absent in the Lower Pecos. Perhaps the new style was more efficient for the
newly high-ranked deer, which would surely have replaced bison as the preferred meat source. Toolkits
in general became more diverse, as diet breadth widened and generalization became necessary in order to
effectively intensify the use and processing of lower ranked food sources (Prewitt 1981:73).
The Late Archaic, as noted earlier, is divided into subperiods I and II. The first portion saw a
continuation of the dry period initiated earlier, and burned rock midden accumulations peaked at this
9

time. The Bulverde point, although in some respects similar in form to Travis/Nolan points, is seen, at
least by Johnson, to be a distinct technological break, and again to have apparent influences from the
northeast and Plains regions (Johnson 1995:89-90). It is this break, combined with a continuity seen in
succeeding Pedernales types as well as the extent of burned rock midden accumulations, that has resulted
in this major reordering of this portion of the Archaic.
Also appearing about this time was the Marcos-style point, another broad-bladed point with deep corner
or side notching, similar in some respects to the Pedernales, at least in width of blade. It is at this time
that Late Archaic I shifts to Late Archaic II, and the climate seems to become much moister. Apparently
bison are present throughout most of the Late Archaic, even as narrow-bladed Ensor/Fairland points begin
replacing the broader Marcos/Williams/Marshalls.
One interesting way of explaining this seeming discrepancy would be by having these latter points hafted
on arrows (Tomka 1998), with an underlying (but wholly subjective) assumption that darts did not have
enough penetrating power for bison, and so the emphasis was on a wide blade causing extensive
hemorrhaging. The penetration of darts was perhaps sufficient for deer if a narrower blade was used. A
narrow blade propelled by a bow, however, might have enough penetration to effectively kill a bison.
Regardless, increased moisture saw a retreat of the xerophytes, and a corresponding decrease in the
construction of burned rock middens, especially in the eastern portion of Central Texas.
There is also evidence of increasing populations, and processing of plants other than xerophytes is evident
based on an increase in numbers of groundstone from these components (Collins 1995:385). It is not
clear what was being so extensively processed with these implements. Acorns and grass seeds are two
possibilities. Cemeteries became more widespread, as does evidence of internecine warfare (Hall
1981:iii). Combined, these would suggest an attachment to land and protection of resources, and also a
certain increase in environmental stress or resource depletion. As well, Johnson sees general technologies
arriving from the plains, while social variables seem to be influenced from Woodland cultures to the east
and northeast (Johnson 1995:96, 97). In short, it seems to be a time of rapid changes in social complexity
with resource intensification and a broadening of the diet base, most likely as a response to the demands
of increasingly large human populations.
The Late Prehistoric Period seems to be a continuation of Late Archaic lifeways up until Toyah times
when bison reappeared, as did a more nomadic life as well as technologies (blades and specialized
scrapers) not seen since Paleoindian times. The Late Prehistoric Period has been subdivided into two
distinct intervals by Collins (1995: 385), which correspond to Prewittâs Neo-Archaic Austin and Toyah
Phases. The early Late Prehistoric, or Austin Phase, shows a distinct trend toward arrow points, but the
Archaic lifeways seem to persist. The late Late Prehistoric corresponds to the Toyah Phase, and cultural
remains indicate a shift back toward a hunting subsistence base. Bison apparently became common once
more in Central Texas (Collins 1995:377, Table 2; Prewitt, 1981:84), and prehistoric peoples evidently
took full advantage of that resource. This period, of course, came to its conclusion shortly after the
arrival of Europeans to Texas in the early 16th century, marking the beginning of the Historic Period.
In the coastal region of the Colorado River drainage, Ricklis (1995) has proposed that the Late Prehistoric
extends from about A.D. 1000 to about A.D. 1700. During that era, the material assemblage includes
10

pottery with types identified as sandy paste Goose Creek variations and Rockport Black-on-Gray
variations some with asphaltum decorations. During the Historic period and quite probably during the
later part of the Late Prehistoric, Karankawan groups occupied the central coast. Archaeological data
suggest that the Karankawa spent the fall and winter along the coastline in large encampments (Ricklis
1996:101). Fishing and collection of shellfish were the principal economic pursuits at these sites. In the
early spring, and continuing through the summer, the Karankawa moved inland to smaller camps along
the rivers and creeks that empty into the coastal bays. The collection of wild plant foods and hunting of
deer and bison were important pursuits during that portion of the year.
Historic (200 BP - recent times)
Native American. The Historic Period begins at the time of European contact, ca A.D. 1500, although
along the Colorado River little direct interaction between Native Americans and Europeans occurred for
as much as 200 years after this time. Evidence of the early part of this period in terms of archaeological
materials is generally quite rare and minimal. While the descendants of the Late Prehistoric in the
vicinity of the mouth of the Colorado River appear to be the historic Karankawa (Ricklis 1995), the
cultural evolution of descendants of the Toyah Phase peoples is not well understood in the Central Texas
region. For example, Campbell (1988:73) cautiously names at least 60 historic Indian groups associated
with the Bastrop County area. Of these, only a portion could be considered native to the area. The
Tonkawa, generally believed by the public to be the single indigenous "tribe" of Central Texas, were
immigrants probably from what is now Oklahoma (Campbell 1988:75). Further westward in the Hill
Country, the Apache and Comanche were present during the Historic Period. Aggressive European
settlement across eastern and coastal Texas just into the fringes of the Hill Country destroyed most of the
native population prior to their removal to reservations.
Euro-American. In the early 1530s, Cabeza de Vaca became the first known European to transverse the
lower Colorado River (Hester 1999). Members of La Salleâs expedition and a number of early Spanish
explorers and missionaries crossed the Colorado in the late seventeenth century, but it was not until the
early eighteenth century that Europeans are known to have stayed for any length of time on the river
(Baumgartner et al. 1997:17-26). In 1709, for example, the Spanish explorers of the Espinosa-Aguirre
Expedition stopped along the river in the vicinity of Wilbarger Creek between present-day Austin and
Bastrop (Campbell 1983).
There are no records of any Spanish missions being constructed on the Colorado River, and actual
Spanish settlement on the Colorado River did not occur until relatively late. In 1805, Manuel Bustamante
ordered Spanish troops to be stationed at the El Camino Real crossing of the Colorado at present-day
Bastrop, where a stockade was built and named Puesta del Colorado (Webb 1952, Vol. 2:120). It was not
until 1829 that permanent settlement began at Bastrop (formerly called Mina) with the arrival of settlers
associated with Stephen F. Austinâs third grant that was also known as the âLittle Colony.â
Shortly before his death in 1821, Moses Austin had obtained from Spain the first land grant to introduce
American families into Texas. By the time the Congress of Mexico reaffirmed conditions of this grant to
his son, Stephen F. Austin, in 1823, settlement of the âOld Three Hundredâ families on the lower Brazos

11

and Colorado rivers was well under way. On the Colorado River drainage, the grant allowed Anglo
settlement from the coast all the way up to the vicinity of present-day La Grange in Fayette County.
Typical of early Anglo settlement on the Colorado River was Beasonâs Crossing near the present-day
town of Columbus (Webb 1952:378). Among the early colonists at this settlement was Jesse Burnam,
who was able to raise enough able-bodied men in the Beasonâs Crossing area in 1822 to march down to
the mouth of the Colorado to check on the robbery of a sailing vessel (Webb 1952:378). Downstream in
present-day Wharton County, 25 of the âOld Three Hundredâ families received title to land in that county
in 1823 and 1824. Early settlement there centered around a trading post called Preston, which was
located on the east bank of the river about 10 miles south of the current town of Wharton (Webb
1952:890). By the early 1830s, the western edge of the frontier had extended into eastern Travis County
with a chain of small family forts located at Webberâs Prairie, Coleman Branch, and Fort Prairie (Webb
1952:796).
Numerous men from the Colorado River settlements participated in the Texas Revolution. However,
none of the major battles occurred on the Colorado River. Beasonâs Crossing figured prominently,
though, in the Runaway Scrape, as many Texans crossed the Colorado at that location. After their safe
passage, Houston ordered the town of Columbus burned (Webb 1952:379).
Following the Texas Revolution, the community of Waterloo in central Travis County was selected as the
capital and renamed Austin in 1839. Settlements on the Colorado River below Austin continued to grow
as more settlers arrived in the years leading up to the Civil War. In counties on the coastal plain,
plantation-style agriculture was practiced by the wealthier landowners. While the majority of the settlers
were originally from the southern United States, German immigrants began entering the Biegelâs
Settlement area in Fayette County in the 1830s (Carter and Ragsdale 1976). After the Civil War, many
former plantation owners in Fayette, Colorado, and Wharton counties sold their lands in small parcels to
other German and Czech immigrants. They, along with former Black slaves, usually worked the land as
tenant farmers before accumulating enough money to purchase land. Cotton, corn and sorghum were the
staple crops well into the mid-twentieth century.
Prior to the Civil War, Anglo settlement had spread up the Colorado River into through western Travis,
Burnet and San Saba counties. Fort Croghan was established at the future townsite of Burnet in 1849
(Webb 1952:253). Among the earliest settlers in this region were a group of Mormons who operated a
mill. Noah Smithwick, a well-known early settler in Bastrop County, bought the Mormonsâ mill in 1854
when he moved upstream to Burnet County. Several years later he built a new mill at a new site on the
nearby Colorado River (Smithwick 1983). Settlement along the middle Colorado was well-established by
the mid-1850s (Malof 2008).
Archival and oral historical research has been undertaken in recent years on a number of the early
communities in the present Lake Travis area in Travis and Burnet counties (Utley 1994 and 1996). In this
research, Utley (1996:9-10) notes that the Texas Hill Country lies west of the 98th meridian, Webbâs
(1931:8-9) dividing line between forested areas of the eastern United States and the Great Plains.
Following Webbâs thesis concerning how this dividing line affected the way of life of early settlers, Utley

12

shows how early attempts at cotton farming in the rocky soils frequently failed. As a result, most settlers
adapted to ranching and other economic pursuits.
The construction of a chain of four lakes by the newly formed LCRA in the late 1930s and early 1940s
dramatically changed the landscape and the small communities along the Colorado River in western
Travis, Burnet and Llano counties. The former emphasis on ranching has given way to the development
of lakefront subdivisions and tourism associated with the lakes.

Results of Investigations
During calendar year 2012, the LCRAâs Archaeology Services staff conducted in-house cultural resource
investigations for 41 projects reportable under TAC Permit 6160. Table 1 provides a listing of the project
names, project numbers, interim report numbers (if necessary), dates of investigations and THC
concurrence (when applicable) and the construction status of each project. This table also gives data on
archeological sites that were recorded or revisited during each project, the SAL status of each
archeological site, the amount of acreage involved in each project area, and the county in which each
project is situated.
All projects during 2012 took place within LCRAâs statutory district and service area. While much of
this activity is related to development of parks and preserves, recent transmission line acquisitions and
construction of electrical substations have also contributed to the projects requiring cultural resource
review.

Part I. Full Reports of Survey Investigations
During calendar year 2012 there were 10 projects that required immediate reporting to the THC. These
were for projects that were larger than 5 acres in size and/or contained cultural resource sites that might
be impacted by a particular project. The projects included brush clearing and a new boundary fence on
LCRA lands, a new electrical substation, transmission line upgrades and one rebuild project, and notably,
a new transmission line in Guadalupe County. All 10 of these projects were reviewed by the THC and in
each case the recommendations by LCRA staff were agreed to.
Also included in this section are the comprehensive survey results of LCRAâs Turkey Bend Recreation
Area which collects the results of several years of small projects and inventory surveys, and following an
agreement with the Texas Historical Commission, is one of a series of such reports on LCRA lands.
Because there were no project-driven components to this project, this report had not been previously
reviewed by THC.

Project 3.12 A Cultural Resource Survey and Assessment of the City of Goldthwaiteâs
Proposed Water Intake and Pipeline Project at the LCRA San Saba River Nature Park, San Saba
County, Texas

ABSTRACT

In January 2012, the Lower Colorado River Authorityâs (LCRA) Cultural Resources Services staff
conducted an intensive cultural resource survey and assessment of the City of Goldthwaiteâs proposed
water intake and pipeline project within the LCRA San Saba River Nature Park, in San Saba County,
Texas. In addition to pedestrian survey, the work included the mechanical excavation of six backhoe
trenches and the excavation of soil column from the wall of one of the trenches.
At Backhoe Trench 1, northern extension of prehistoric deposits related to previously recorded State
Archeological Landmark site 41SS113 was found. Although a buried burned rock feature was recorded
there, the dispersed and scattered nature of the observed material is indicative of moderate to severe postdepositional disturbance. Additionally, the extremely small numbers of artifacts recovered in the sample
column suggest a low interpretative potential.
While the LCRA Cultural Resources staff assesses the prehistoric finds in Backhoe Trench 1 as not
significant, use of the areas further northward at Backhoe Trenches 5 and 6 are proposed as locations for
the water intake structure and adjoining sections of the pipeline. This proposal will further ensure that no
significant or potentially significant parts of the 41SS113 prehistoric component are impacted. It is also
recommended that the remainder of the proposed pipeline route within the park property be approved for
construction since no significant or potentially significant prehistoric materials were found in other
backhoe trenches further westward and southwestward on LCRA park property.
All artifacts collected during the project will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Lab.

INTRODUCTION

The City of Goldthwaite is proposing to construct a water intake structure and a water pipeline segment
within the LCRA San Saba River Nature Park in San Saba County, Texas (Figure 4). The water intake
will be situated on the west bank of Mill Creek near the west central edge of the park. The water intake
structure will cover an approximately 3.7 x 3.7 meter (12 x 12 ft) area and will be constructed within a 7.6
x7.6 meter (25 x25 ft) work area (Figure 5). The concrete footings of the water intake structure will
extend to about 61 cm (2 ft) below ground surface. To draw water from the creek channel, a 30.4-cm (12inch) diameter pipeline will angle southeastward down the slope from the water intake structure to a depth
of about 5.8 meters (19 ft) below ground surface. This intake pipeline will be installed by open cut
trenching and backfilling.
The proposed water pipeline that will transport water to the City of Goldthwaite will be a 20.3-cm (8inch) diameter pipe that will be placed in a backhoe trench 1.22 meters (4 feet) below ground surface. It
will extend for a distance of approximately 142 linear meters (466 ft) from the water intake to the western
boundary of the LCRA park. From that point the pipeline will continue westward through the northern
part of the City of San Saba and then northward and extend for a distance of about 12 miles to a reservoir
owned by the City of Goldthwaite.
On January 13, 2012, the LCRA Cultural Resource staff conducted an intensive cultural resource survey
of the portion of the water project that lies within LCRA property at the San Saba River Nature Park.
The investigation was conducted under the LCRA Blanket Annual Antiquities Permit 6160. LCRA
personnel involved in the project were Daniel J. Prikryl (Principal Investigator) and Andrew F. Malof
along with contracted archaeologists Charles Hixson, Patrick Hatten, and Buddy Whitley.

BACKGROUND TO INVESTIGATIONS

General
The environmental and cultural background data for the San Saba River Nature Park area have been
previously described in the report of LCRAâs intensive cultural resource survey of the park in 2010
(Prikryl et al. 2010:6-18). The reader is referred to that document for detailed information. The current
project area is situated at the western edge of the park property, and the proposed construction lies
immediately west of the Mill Creek channel with the San Saba River generally being only 100 to 120
meters to the north. The depth of floodplain alluvium on this section of the San Saba River floodplain
appears to range from 1.8 to 9.1 m (6 to 30 ft) in thickness. Previous investigations consisting of the
intensive survey of the park (ibid) and test excavations at site 41SS178 (Hixson et al. 2011) have only
examined the upper 2 meters of these alluvial deposits. While this work has demonstrated that buried
prehistoric cultural materials extend to at least 1 meter below ground surface at various sites, it is possible
that other unknown prehistoric components could be much more deeply buried. It is also

noteworthy that the Frio silty clay loam topsoil that covers the entire park area appears to preserve bone
and mussel shell very well, with wood charcoal seemingly less well-preserved.
During the previous intensive cultural resource survey of the 46.6-acre park, six new cultural resource
sites, 41SS175-178, 41SS181 and 41SS182, were recorded and assessed. Additionally, previously
recorded site 41SS113 was revisited and assessed. Sites 41SS113, 41SS176, and 41SS177 were
determined to be multi-component sites with both prehistoric and historic materials. Sites 41SS175,
41SS178, and 41SS181 were found to contain prehistoric materials exclusively, while site 41SS182 had
only historic materials.

Previous Work at Site 41SS113
Since the current archaeological investigation lies immediately adjacent to the previously designated
north and west boundaries of 41SS113 and since the current project recovered prehistoric materials that
constitute a northern extension of site (see Figure 5), a summary of previous investigations of that site is
provided. Site 41SS113 was originally recorded by Fox (1994) during a cultural resource survey for a
proposed City of San Saba sewer line. At the site, Fox found burned rock, mussel, and chert chipping
debris along the terrace edge of Mill Creek in the vicinity of a previously constructed sewer pipeline. He
estimated that the site covered an area measuring 40 by 50 m and that the depth of cultural deposits was 2
m. The site was assessed as potentially significant, and impacts to the site were avoided by continuing the
usage of the existing pipeline for wastewater flows as opposed to building a new pipeline within the site
boundaries.
During the 2010 LCRA park survey, a single backhoe trench was initially excavated at site 41SS113 due
to LCRAâs original proposal to construct the western end of a footbridge over Mill Creek within the site
boundaries. The backhoe trench was excavated in the southeast part of the site where the main
concentration of materials had been previously seen by Fox (ibid). The soil profile of the backhoe trench
indicated that the upper 30 cm of soil deposits were disturbed from the construction of a nearby sewer
pipeline and that the artifacts in the first two levels were all early twentieth century historic trash debris.
However, the screened soil samples of backhoe trench fill from 60 to 100 cm below ground surface
contained numerous burned rocks and a few mussel shells, bone fragments, and several chert flakes. The
most noteworthy find was an apparent prehistoric burned rock feature that showed in the wall of the
backhoe trench at depths of 70 to 75 cm below ground surface. This feature consisted of a horizontal line
of burned rocks and chunks of wood charcoal that extended for a length of almost 50 cm in the trench
wall.
Based on the prehistoric finds in this backhoe trench, the location of the proposed footbridge was moved
so that site 41SS113 would not be affected. Since no other park development elements were slated for the
general area in or around site 41SS113, the remainder of work at the site consisted of pedestrian survey to
define the extent of materials evident on ground surface, and the excavation of two shovel tests. During
the pedestrian survey, a dart point of the Frio type was found on ground surface about 7 meters southwest
of the backhoe trench excavation. The pedestrian survey also led to the identification of a historic
component at the site, and as a result the site boundaries were extended to the north and west so that the
30

site area measures 65 meters on a north-south line by 105 meters on an east-west line (see Figure 5). Oral
history work and archival research led to the conclusion that the historic component represented an early
to mid-twentieth century trash dump. The two shovel tests were excavated north and west of the backhoe
trench to further sample the prehistoric and historic components. No historic artifacts were found and
only a very few prehistoric artifacts were recovered from the shovel tests.
As a result of the survey, LCRA assessed the prehistoric component at 41SS113 along with the
prehistoric components of at all other sites within the park as potentially meriting formal designation as
State Archeological Landmarks (SAL). The historic component at 41SS113 was assessed as not SAL
eligible. The Texas Historical Commission concurred with these assessments in April 2010.
Following the subsequent test excavations at site 41SS178, the THC formally designated 41SS178 and
the prehistoric components at all other sites in the San Saba River Nature Park including 41SS113 as
SALs.

METHODOLOGY

A pedestrian survey of the water intake and pipeline corridor was conducted at the start of the field
investigation. This included examination of the cutbank slope of the Mill Creek channel down to about
4.5 m (15 ft) below ground surface. Ground surface visibility ranged from fair to poor. Although a few
historic period artifacts related to 41SS113 were seen on ground surface, the pedestrian survey confirmed
existing data which indicated that almost all prehistoric materials previously found at 41SS113 were in
buried contexts. Given this fact, backhoe trenching was selected as the primary method for determining if
any prehistoric materials were present at the proposed locations of the project construction elements
(Figure 6). Since the proposed water intake is situated in the area nearest the boundaries of the prehistoric
component at 41SS113, it was determined that work would begin at that location and then move
westward to other portions of the proposed pipeline ROW.

Figure 6. Excavation of Backhoe Trench 1.

31

The backhoe trenches ranged from 5 to 8 m in length. Depths of the backhoe trench excavations varied
between 140 and 196 cm (4.6 to 6.4 ft). During the excavation of each trench at least one archaeologist
stood adjacent to the trench to watch for artifacts that might be uncovered by the trenching bucket. At
least one archaeologist was also positioned adjacent to the backdirt pile to look for artifacts in each bucket
load of soil matrix that was dumped on the backdirt pile. Following the completion of the excavation, the
walls of the trench were visually inspected for artifacts and features. A 1-meter wide section of one of the
walls was cleaned with trowels and a soil profile was then drawn on graph paper. All exposed artifacts
and features were plotted on the soil profile. At Backhoe Trench 1, where a scattering of burned rocks
was found at depth of 90 to 96 cm below ground surface in the wall and bottom of the trench, a 50 by 60
cm column of soil was hand excavated in a manner to expose a sample area of the burned rocks. The soil
matrix from this column was screened through a one-quarter inch wire mesh, maintaining 20 cm-thick
levels. All artifacts recovered from the soil column were bagged by level. Since no features or artifact
clusters suggestive of prehistoric living surfaces were found in any of the other trenches, no other soil
columns were hand excavated and screened at any of the other trench locations.

RESULTS

A total of six backhoe trenches were excavated with prehistoric materials including a burned rock feature
being identified and further explored at the Backhoe Trench 1 location. The finds at Backhoe Trench 1
appear to represent a northern extension site 41SS113âs prehistoric component. Several historic period
whiteware sherds were also found in the upper 50 cm of soil matrix at Backhoe Trench 1 in deposits that
appear to have been disturbed by the dumping and subsequent removal of limestone rubble. Elsewhere,
very small numbers of possible prehistoric artifacts were found at Backhoe Trench 2 (n=3) and Backhoe
Trench 5 (n=1). Historic period artifacts that appear to represent debris left over from trash burning
episodes were identified in the upper deposits of Backhoe Trench 2. The results of the backhoe trenching
and the finds made during the work are described in detail in the following paragraphs.

Backhoe Trench Descriptions

Backhoe Trench 1
Backhoe Trench 1 was placed near the originally proposed location of the intake structure near the edge
of the Mill Creek terrace. It was aligned roughly perpendicular to the creek bank and parallel with the
proposed pipeline route. The trench was less than 10 m in length and excavated to a final depth of
approximately 140 cm. Cultural material was encountered first in the upper 40-50 cm of soil, and
consisted of limestone rock rubble and a few pieces of whiteware. No other cultural material was seen
until what turned out to be Feature 1 (described below) was encountered as a few pieces of weathered,
shattered limestone along with two or three mussel shell fragments at a depth of about 90 cm. The trench
was then extended westward, but excavation ceased when additional rock was discovered on the trench
floor at the same elevation as that seen in the trench wall.
32

The soil profile consisted of 15-20 cm of brown clay loam over a dark grayish-brown clay loam which
was 25 to 30 cm in thickness (Appendix Figure 9). The next soil zone was very similar to that seen at the
surface, and was likewise 15-20 cm thick. This rested upon a brown silty clay loam into which intruded a
zone of dense carbonate threads, which continued to the bottom of the trench.

Backhoe Trench 2
This trench was dug along the proposed pipeline route about 28 meters west-northwest of Backhoe
Trench 1 at an area about 10 meters north of the north edge of a cluster of oak trees. During the original
park survey, most of the surface historic materials associated with 41SS113 had been found within this
cluster of trees. It appears that this trench location may be within an area where historic period trash was
burned since the excavation of the upper deposits quickly showed several areas of very dark ashy soil
containing historic period artifacts. These artifacts included plain whiteware ceramics, rusted scrap metal,
and clear and green glass fragments. Additionally, some wood charcoal and clumps of orange-brown
colored soil were also present in the dark soil areas. The burned soil and associated materials extended
down to 20 to 30 cm below ground surface.
Otherwise, the only other potential artifacts found during the monitoring of trench excavation and the
examination of the backdirt piles consisted of one mussel shell fragment and a very small possible burned
rock that may be the result of prehistoric activities. One other mussel shell fragment was found in situ in
the south wall of the trench near the top of Zone 3 deposits at a depth of 73 cm below ground surface.
The mussel shell and the possible burned rock fragment came from depths of 40 to 60 cm bgs.
Three soil zones were apparent in the 1-meter wide section of the south wall that was profiled (Appendix
Figure 10). Zone 1 consisted of a very dark gray to black (10YR2.5/1) silty clay loam that contained the
high amounts of organic material, wood charcoal, and historic debris described in the paragraph above.
This zone extended from ground surface to a general depth of 35 cm.
Zone 2 ranged from 35 to 69 cm below ground surface. It was described as a dark grayish-brown
(10YR4/2) silty clay loam. Zone 3 is a grayish-brown (10YR5/2) silty clay with a large volume of
calcium carbonate filaments. This zone extended from 69 to 125 cm below ground surface at the location
of the soil profile and down to 140 cm elsewhere in the deepest parts of the trench.

Backhoe Trench 3
Backhoe Trench 3 was excavated adjacent to the existing park service road along the proposed pipeline
route. The trench lies about 10 meters north of the western edge of Site 41SS113 as defined during the
park survey in 2010. This trench was placed about 35 meters southwest of Backhoe Trench 2 and 36
meters southeast of Backhoe Trench 4. The trench was excavated for a length of 8 meters with the
maximum depth of excavation being 132 cm (4.3 ft). No artifacts or cultural features were found by the
archaeologists during the monitoring of the excavation of this trench.
33

After inspecting the walls of the trench, a 1-meter-wide section of the southeast wall of the trench was
scraped clean, photographed, and profiled. The soil profile indicated that three soil zones were evident.
Zone 1 is a very dark grayish-brown (10YR3/2) silty clay loam that extends from ground surface down to
about 30 cm below ground surface. Zone 2 is described as a grayish-brown (10YR5/2) silty clay loam
that was seen from 30 to 52 cm below ground surface. Zone 3 is a brown (10YR5/3) silty clay loam from
52 cm below ground surface to the bottom of the trench.

Backhoe Trench 4
This backhoe trench was placed on the west side of the service road along a potential alternate route for
the western half of the portion of the pipeline on LCRA property. Later, it was determined that this
alternate route will not be utilized. The trench location is about 50 meters north of the previously defined
boundary of site 41SS113. The trench is situated about 56 meters northwest of Backhoe Trench 2 and 36
meters northwest of Backhoe Trench 3. The trench was excavated for a length of 8 meters to a maximum
depth of 125 cm (4.1 ft). No artifacts or cultural features were found by the archaeologists during the
monitoring of the excavation of the trench.
A 1-meter wide section of the south wall of the backhoe trench was cleaned, photographed, and profiled.
The soil profile showed that three soil zones are present. The uppermost zone is a brown (10YR4/3) silty
clay that extends down to 31 cm below ground surface. It is underlain by Zone 2, a very dark grayishbrown (10YR3/2) silty clay, to a depth of 55 cm below ground surface. Zone 3, which follows from 55 to
125 cm below ground surface, is a brown (10YR5/3) silty clay.

Backhoe Trench 5
This backhoe trench was excavated to aid in defining an alternate location for the water intake and
pipeline that will extend downward to the creek channel while the Feature 1 area was simultaneously
being explored at Backhoe Trench 1. The trench is situated about 7 meters north of Backhoe Trench 1 on
the west terrace edge overlooking Mill Creek (see Figure 5). The trench was excavated to a maximum
depth of 192 cm (Appendix Figure 11). The only potential artifact found was a rib bone fragment of a
medium to large sized mammal that was present in the backhoe trench wall at about 44 cm bgs.
The soil profile showed that Zone 1, the surface deposit, is a very dark gray (10YR3/1) to very dark
grayish-brown (10YR3/2) clay loam that extends down to a depth of 43 cm. From 43 to 88 cm bgs, the
Zone 2 fill is very dark grayish-brown (10YR3/2) silty clay loam followed by Zone 3 which is a brown
(10YR4/3 to 5/3) silty clay loam containing a minor amount of calcium carbonate filaments that occurs
from about 88 to 110 cm bgs. Zone 4, the deepest deposit, extends from 110 to 192 cm bgs. It is a brown
(10YR4/3 to 5/3) silty clay loam that has a much higher content of calcium carbonate filaments.

34

Backhoe Trench 6
To further explore an alternate location for the intake and pipeline, Backhoe Trench 6 was excavated from
7 to 14 meters west of the west end of Backhoe Trench 5. It also lay about 5 to 7 meters northwest of the
west end of Backhoe Trench 1, and it is situated within the south edge of an area where limestone rubble
and other trash debris had previously been dumped and later removed with heavy machinery. The trench
was excavated to a maximum depth of 195 cm (6.4 ft). Despite an intense search of the backfill and the
trench walls, no artifacts were found during the excavation of this trench.
The soil profile indicated that the surface deposit called Zone 1 extended from ground surface to a depth
of 20 cm (Appendix Figure 12). The Zone 1 matrix is brown (10YR 4/3) clay loam with some gray
mottles suggestive of previous soil disturbance. Zone 2 is very dark grayish-brown (10YR 3/2) clay loam
slopes downward to the east so that it becomes thicker at the east end of the profile. In the center of the
profile it extends from 20 to 35 cm bgs. Zone 3 slopes downward to the east even more dramatically than
Zone 2. Zone 3 ranges from 32 to 47 cm bgs at the west end of the profile to 40 to 68 cm bgs at the east
end of the one-meter wide profile. The Zone 3 matrix is a dark grayish-brown (10YR4/2) silty clay loam.
Zone 4 is a dark grayish-brown (10YR 4/2.5) silty clay loam that contains some calcium carbonate
filaments. In the central part of the wall profile, it extends from about 44 to 169 cm below ground
surface. A large disturbance that measures about 40 cm in diameter is located in the upper part of this
zone at the west end of the one-meter wide profile section. This disturbance has grayish-brown and
yellowish-brown soil mottles and consists of a mixture of clay loam and dense clay matrix. Since some
tree roots are present in the matrix, the disturbance may be related to the tree or the pit created when the
tree was uprooted. Alternately, it may be related to previous usage of heavy machinery to remove
limestone boulders in this general vicinity. Zone 5, at the bottom of the backhoe trench, is a grayishbrown (10YR5/2) silty clay loam with some calcium carbonate filaments. This zone begins at about 169
cm bgs and continues to the bottom of the trench at 195 cm bgs.

FEATURE DESCRIPTION

Feature 1
Feature 1 was encountered in BHT 1 at a depth of about 90 cm bgs when several apparent burned
limestone rocks were removed by the backhoe bucket. All told, burned limestone rocks were visible in
either the wall or the floor of the sloping trench for a distance of approximately 2.2 meters (Figure 7). A
50 x 60 cm column called Unit 1 was excavated down onto top of the primary concentration of rock seen
within the trench wall (Figure 8). All fill was screened through Â¼ wire mesh. Recovery consisted of a
single flake found just above the rock lens, two mussel shells, a mussel shell fragment and a small piece
of bone, all within an absolute elevation ranging from about 90-96 cm bgs. The rocks within the trench
wall were highly fragmented, having been damaged by the backhoe bucket. One rock within the trench
floor was fairly large â about 30 cm in diameter. The remainder were 10 to 15 cm in diameter or smaller.
It is unknown how intact the feature adjacent to the screened column may have been. If the remaining
35

rocks can be considered an indication of its size, then the feature would have been approximately 30 cm
in diameter. The presence of the cultural material within a fairly discrete vertical zone suggests a living
surface at the corresponding depth, however the dispersed and scattered nature of the observed material
indicates moderate to severe post-depositional disturbance. Furthermore, the extremely sparse amount of
cultural remains would make any meaningful analysis or interpretation extremely difficult or impossible.
Also, unlike the burned rock feature found in previous trenching at 41SS113 during the park survey, no
wood charcoal was evident within or near the burned rocks at Backhoe Trench 1.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Cultural resources investigations for the City of Goldthwaiteâs proposed water intake structure and
associated water pipeline segment that are proposed for placement within the LCRAâs San Saba River
Nature Park were conducted on January 13, 2012 by the LCRA Cultural Resource staff. The project area
is located immediately north and west of previously recorded site 41SS113. This site is a multicomponent site with prehistoric and historic remains. The prehistoric component has been formally
designated as a SAL, while the historic component was previously assessed as not SAL eligible.
In addition to pedestrian survey of the terrace top and visual examination of the cutbank slope on Mill
Creek, the current work included the mechanical excavation of six backhoe trenches to sample the two
potential locations of the water intake structure along with the approximately 142 meter long proposed
water pipeline corridor. A northern extension of site 41SS113 was discovered, as prehistoric materials
including a burned rock cluster designated as Feature 1 were found at depths of 90 to 96 cm bgs in
Backhoe Trench 1, at the originally proposed location of the water intake structure. The hand excavation
and screening of a 50 by 60 cm soil column to expose a portion of the burned rock feature and
surrounding living surface produced a meager number artifacts consisting of one chert flake, three mussel
shell fragments, and one bone fragment. The dispersed and scattered nature of the observed material is
indicative of moderate to severe post-depositional disturbance. The extremely small numbers of artifacts
37

recovered in the sample column suggest a low interpretative potential. Also, no wood charcoal that
might aid in dating the feature was evident.
While the soil column was being excavated to explore the potential significance of the Feature 1 area, two
additional trenches, Backhoe Trenches 5 and 6, were excavated about 7 to 14 meters to the north and
northwest of Backhoe Trench 1 to determine if those areas could be utilized as alternative locations for
the water intake structure and adjacent portions of the pipeline right-of-way. Aside from one isolated rib
bone fragment of a medium sized mammal that was found at a depth of 44 cm in Backhoe Trench 5, no
artifacts or evidences of features were found in these two trenches.
Although the LCRA Cultural Resources staff assesses the prehistoric finds in Backhoe Trench 1 as not
significant, use of the areas further northward in and around Backhoe Trenches 5 and 6 are proposed as
locations for the water intake structure and adjacent pipeline. This proposal will further ensure that no
significant or potentially significant parts of the 41SS113 prehistoric component are impacted. It is also
recommended that the remainder of the proposed pipeline route within the park property be approved for
construction since no significant or potentially significant prehistoric materials were found in Backhoe
Trenches 2 or 3.

ABSTRACT

In February and March 2012, the Lower Colorado River Authorityâs (LCRA) Cultural Resources Services
staff conducted an intensive cultural resource survey of LCRAâs portions of the proposed El Campo-toRicebird-to-Nada Transmission Line Upgrade and Substation Addition Project in Wharton and Colorado
counties, Texas. The investigation focused on high-probability areas for unrecorded cultural resource
sites within LCRAâs existing T-545 electrical transmission line corridor.
No cultural resource sites were found as a result of the work. It is recommended that the proposed
construction be allowed to proceed, as currently planned, with the understanding that standard emergency
discovery provisions are applicable.
Because of the negative results of the survey, there are no artifacts that will require curation.

INTRODUCTION

The Lower Colorado River Authorityâs (LCRA) Transmission Services Corporation (TSC) is working
with the South Texas Electric Co-op (STEC) to construct a new project called the El Campo-to-Ricebirdto-Nada Transmission Line Upgrade and Substation Addition Project (Figure 13, Figure 14, Figure 15,
Figure 16). LCRA TSC will convert the portion of its existing El Campo-to-Altair 69 kilovolt (kV)
transmission line (T-545) that extends from the El Campo Substation to the STEC Nada Substation to a
138 kV operation. This work will include replacing the existing H-frame transmission pole structures
with single poles in the southern part of the project area between the El Campo Substation and Farm-toMarket Road (FM) 2765. From FM 2765 to the Nada Substation at the north end of the project area, the
existing H-frame structures will be replaced with new H-frames. Basically, every other one of the
existing H-frame structures will be replaced with single pole or new H-frame structure. The majority of
the new transmission pole structures will be placed within 10 feet of the existing H-frames, but in some
cases the new structures may be erected as far as 30 feet from the existing structures. Those H-frame
structures that are not being directly replaced will be removed.
The project will also involve the construction of the new Ricebird Substation, which will be built on a 5
acre tract immediately adjacent to LCRAâs T-545 line. STEC will purchase and own the substation
property. Both STEC and LCRA will install equipment within the substation. Additionally, STEC will
add some acreage to the south end of its existing STEC Nada Substation at the north end of the project.
That addition will involve adding a 150 ft long strip to the south end of the substation. STEC will own
and construct the majority of the equipment to be placed within the Nada Substation addition. LCRA will
own a new transmission pole structure within the Nada Substation addition.
On February 29 and March 1, 2012, the LCRA Cultural Resource staff conducted an intensive cultural
resource survey of the LCRAâs portion of the project. The work involved investigation of highprobability areas for unrecorded cultural resource sites. The investigation was conducted under the LCRA
Blanket Annual Antiquities Permit 6160. LCRA personnel involved in the project were Daniel J. Prikryl
(Principal Investigator) and Andrew F. Malof along with contracted archaeologist Charles Hixson.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

The project area is located in southeast Texas within the West Gulf section of the Coastal Plains
physiographic province (Fenneman 1938:100-103). The project area is situated west of the Colorado
River valley in upland prairie areas that are mapped within the Upland Prairies and Woods portion of the
Gulf Coast Prairies and Marshes ecological region (LBJ School of Public Affairs 1978). Most of the
project area is either in cultivated fields or areas that were probably once under cultivation during the
historic period. Crops observed last summer during a survey of the nearby T-548 Transmission Line
Upgrade Project consisted of rice, corn, milo and cotton. Very few of the stream channels within and
near the project area preserve woody riparian zones, but several stands of live oak trees were observed

near the transmission line in sandier soil settings. Among the larger stream channels that the transmission
line crosses are Tres Palacios Creek, Blue Creek and East Mustang Creek, which are all located in the
southern part of the project area. Two smaller creeks, Jones Creek and Mott Slough, are situated in the
central part of the project area.
Surface geology in the project area consists of the Pleistocene-aged Beaumont Formation which consists
of clay, silt and sand (Barnes 1974). It contains calcium carbonate concretions, iron oxide and ironmanganese oxides. Soils are variable across the project area, and range from fine sandy loams to heavy
dark clays (McEwen and Crout 1974). Within the high-probability areas that were actually field
surveyed, the Edna fine sandy loam was mapped as being present on the terraces adjacent to Tres Palacios
Creek and on the north and west sides of Jones Creek. This soil type has a dark gray fine sandy loam A
horizon of 23 cm average thickness. It is underlain by a light gray clay B horizon. The other two larger
creeks, Blue Creek and East Mustang Creek, flow through areas where the Lake Charles clay is present
on the adjacent terraces. The typical soil profile for this soil type has an approximately 15 cm thick
surface zone consisting of dark gray to black clay of medium, granular structure. Deeper, a very dark gray
to black clay having fine angular blocky structure extends from 15 to 97 cm below ground surface. A
final soil type encountered during the survey, the Tuckerman soils, was seen on the flanks of Mott
Slough. It is found in enclosed depressions and low drainways. The Tuckerman soils have an
approximately 20 cm thick gray to light gray loam A horizon with yellowish-brown mottles. It is
underlain by a B horizon that consists of grayish-brown clay loam with light gray and brownish-yellow
mottling. It is usually about 86 cm thick.

PREHISTORIC BACKGROUND

Patterson (1995) places the project area within the southeastern edge of the Southeast Texas
Archeological Region, while Ricklis (2004) puts the project area just outside the southeast edge of this
region. Cultural affinities as defined by projectile point-style distributions suggest strong influences from
both Central Texas and from the southeast including Louisiana, and occasionally from northeast Texas
(Patterson 1995:255). The suggestion of Wharton County as being in a transitional zone has also been
applied to Colorado County and areas northward (Keller and Campbell 1984:24).
Southeast Texas appears to have been occupied by Native American peoples over an approximately
12,000 year period, and Patterson (1995:243) has proposed a general chronology as follows: Paleoindian
(10,000-5000 B.C.), Early Archaic (5000-3000 B.C.), Middle Archaic (3000-1500 B.C.), Late Archaic
(1500 B.C.âA. D. 100), Early Ceramic (A.D. 100-600), Late Prehistoric (A.D. 600-1500), Protohistoric
(A.D. 1500-1700), Historic (A.D. 1700-1950).
Ricklis (2004) notes that most excavations of sites located interior from the coast in Southeast Texas have
produced mixed components. This fact has greatly hampered definition of long-term cultural patterns.
Generally speaking, in interior areas of Southeast Texas it appears that throughout prehistoric times, the
Native Americans were nomadic hunter-gatherers who moved about the landscape to harvest seasonally
available foods. As time passed, human populations grew, and by the Middle to Late Archaic, large
51

cemeteries were being used by Native American groups on the coastal prairies in Austin, Wharton and
Fort Bend counties. Story (1985) has suggested that these cemeteries served as territorial markers in
response to growing population pressures. In this same general region, Hall (1995) has pointed out that
the floodplains of the Brazos and Colorado rivers would have produced an abundance of food resources
that may have contributed to population growth.
Projectile point types that are thought to be common during the Late/Terminal Archaic Period consist of
Kent, Gary, Godley, and Ensor types. The Late Prehistoric Period begins with the appearance of Scallorn
arrow points which indicate that the bow and arrow began to be used around A.D. 700 in interior areas of
Southeast Texas. It is possible that ceramics may have appeared in Wharton County around A.D. 500 but
so few sites have been excavated in this area, the date of the arrival of ceramics is uncertain. Finds of
small amounts of bone-tempered pottery and Perdiz points on some sites in this region suggest that Toyah
Phase people occupied the area during the later part of the Late Prehistoric Period. For example, the
LCRAâs recent cultural resource survey of the nearby T-548 transmission line led to the discovery of two
sites with Toyah Phase diagnostics on the terraces overlooking the east side Eagle Lake in Colorado
County about 14 miles north of the north end of the project area (Malof and Prikryl 2011).

HISTORIC BACKGROUND

The project area extends from the extreme southern end of Colorado County southward through the
western part of Wharton County to the City of El Campo. Early Anglo settlers in these two counties first
arrived in the mid-1820s and were members of Stephen F. Austinâs Old Three Hundred colonists. Their
land grants were mostly located along the Colorado River in southeastern Wharton County and in central
Colorado County in areas far distant from the project area. Many of these settlers brought Black slaves as
laborers and farm workers. Colorado County was formed in 1836 with Columbus at the county seat.
Wharton County was established in 1846 with the town of Wharton in the east central part of the county
being named the county seat.
Early agricultural development before the Civil War utilized the southern plantation system with slave
labor being used to burn wooded areas which were then planted in corn, cotton, and sugar cane. At the
time of the Civil War, the value of acreage in Wharton County was the highest of any county in the state,
and about 70 percent of the countyâs population were Black slaves. In Colorado County, there were
more small farms that existed alongside the large plantations. In particular, cotton and sugarcane were
important products in both counties. Although no fighting occurred during the Civil War in Wharton or
Colorado Counties, the war ruined the regionâs economy (Hudgins 2011).
The town of El Campo, which is located in Wharton County at the southern end of the project area, began
as a railroad camp called Prairie Switch in 1882 on the New York, Texas and Mexican Railway
(Meinardus and Treybig 2011). The camp was used by Mexican cowboys who changed the name to El
Campo in 1890. During this era, ranching was the principal industry and each year thousands of cattle
were shipped to San Antonio. The town had a general store in 1889 and a post office by 1890. Farmers
who moved into the area in subsequent years planted rice, cotton, and corn.
52

Other small Wharton County communities in the vicinity of the transmission line are Taiton and New
Taiton. Taiton, which was originally called Tait, was founded at a location about .6 to 1.4 km west of the
transmission line (Kliner 2012). It was settled by German and Czech immigrants in the 1890s. A post
office was established there in 1896 and an early schoolhouse was replaced in 1901. A Catholic church
that served the community was constructed in 1911, and at that time the community had a population of
about 880 people. After 1915, Taiton declined, and in the 1940s the population had dwindled to 80
residents. During these later years, the center of the community seems to have moved eastward to the
area where the Catholic church stands east of the modern-day State Highway 71. That area is now known
as New Taiton. In the 1960s, the community had a cotton gin and three other businesses. In the late
1980s and 1990s, the nearby New Taiton gas field was developed.
The construction of irrigation canals in Wharton County began around 1900 and encouraged rice
production, particularly as cotton crops were attacked by the boll weevil (Banks and Babcock 1988:14).
The rice market collapsed at the end of World War I, however, and rice production and agriculture, in
general, continued to decline during the Great Depression. Rice production and agriculture rebounded
after World War II, and the number of rice farms in Texas has continued fairly constant since the 1970s.
In the 1930s, gas and oil were discovered in Wharton County and led to increased economic growth.
Presently, agriculture and petroleum-related businesses provide the economic base (Hudgins 2011).
Although Colorado Countyâs prosperity was primarily based on cotton, corn, and cattle production from
its conception until the 1940s, sugarcane and rice became important crops in the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries (Ondintz 2002). The small community called Nada is situated immediately northeast
of the northern end of the project area in extreme southern Colorado County. Many of Nadaâs early
settlers were German and Czech immigrants. The first settlers were the J. William Schoellmann family
who arrived in 1881. The next year, Florian Frnka opened a store and post office. The first church was
dedicated in 1897. After World War II, the Nada school closed and students were sent to the larger
Garwood community school, which is located about 5 miles to the north. The population has remained
steady at approximately 165 from the 1980s through the early twenty-first century (Powers 2012).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

A review of cultural resource management project data on the THCâs digital Sites Atlas indicates that
while a number of intensive cultural resource surveys have been undertaken within a 10-mile radius of the
project area, the majority of these surveys have either yielded negative results or found very few cultural
resource sites. These surveys have mostly consisted of linear pipeline surveys and include four pipelines
corridors, one LCRA electrical transmission line right-of-way, a TxDOT bridge replacement and a
TxDOT borrow pit. All of these projects crossed numerous small creek channels in the uplands on the
west side of the Colorado River in terrain similar to the current project area. The only one of these
projects that led to discovery of any cultural resource sites was Brown et alâs. (2008) survey of the Tres
Palacios gas storage pipeline. Within the portion of that 48-mile-long linear survey in the vicinity of the
current project area, a total of only three sites consisting of two early twentieth century farmstead sites
(41WH97 and 41WH98) and one prehistoric site (41WH100) that consisted of three flint flakes were
53

found. In particular, the near absence of any Native American archaeological sites is noteworthy. On the
LCRA T-548 electrical transmission line route, for example, the terraces and banks along seven creeks
were investigated in the vicinity of the current project with no Native American sites being found.
Avocational archaeologists have recorded two prehistoric sites, 41CD86 and 41CD87, about five miles
north of the north end of the project area adjacent to Marys Creek on high terraces overlooking the
Colorado River floodplain. These two sites may be typical of the larger prehistoric sites in the area. At
these sites numerous chert flakes, chips, and cores are evident and two Late Archaic-aged projectile
points have been found. Further to the east of the project area, Joe Hudgins has recorded a number of
prehistoric lithic scatters and campsites in Wharton County on Caney Creek. One of these sites contained
Pedernales, Gary, Ensor and Perdiz points as well as ceramics.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND FIELD METHODS

The purpose of the cultural resource assessment was to identify and evaluate the State Archeological
Landmark status of all cultural resource sites in the project area. The project was undertaken in
accordance with survey standards established by the Texas Historical Commission as prescribed in the
Antiquities Code of Texas. Prior to the field investigation, pertinent literature on previous cultural
resource investigations was reviewed. It was noted that few prehistoric sites had been found in the
general area. Those prehistoric sites that had been recorded are predominantly located on the 30-to-50-fthigh terrace edges overlooking the Colorado River floodplain. The meager available data for prehistoric
sites in the upland prairie areas similar to the project terrain seemed to suggest a preference for low ridges
and knolls that provided a drainage advantage over the often featureless plains. These locations often
have sandy topsoils.
Historic maps principally consisting of early USGS topographic maps dating to the early twentieth
century were inspected to determine if any house structures or other historic features were shown within
or near the transmission line corridor. Historic maps that were examined consisted of the 1929 Wharton,
Texas U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Tactical Map (1:125,000 scale), the 1965 El Campo, Texas 7.5â
USGS map, the 1959 Garwood, Texas 7.5â USGS map, the 1965 Hahn, Texas 7.5â USGS map and the
1960 New Taiton, Texas 7.5â USGS map. A windshield reconnaissance was also undertaken to aid in
assessing the current conditions of the landscape (i.e. rice fields, urban and suburban expansion) so areas
still having a high probability for cultural resource sites could be identified and an appropriate budget for
locating and assessing such sites could be formulated.
As a result of the background work for the field investigation, terrace areas flanking five stream channels
were assessed as having a high probability for unrecorded aboriginal sites. These streams consisted of
Tres Palacios Creek, Blue Creek, East Mustang Creek, Jones Creek, and Mott Slough. Two locations
were assessed as having a high probability of unrecorded historic period farmstead remains. These
locations consisted of an area east of East Mustang Creek where the 1965 El Campo, Texas 7.5â USGS
depicted a barn or abandoned house structure just south of the transmission line ROW and an area
immediately southeast of the intersection of State Highway 71 and County Road 471 where a house and
54

barn are shown near the ROW on the 1960 New Taiton, Texas 7.5â USGS map. None of the highprobability areas for prehistoric and historic sites are located within or near the two substations but,
instead, are located along the T-545 transmission line.
The intense cultural resource field survey conducted for this project consisted of pedestrian survey and
shovel testing, where needed, of the high-probability areas described above. During the pedestrian
survey, a three-person crew walked zig-zag transects down the length of the transmission line corridor.
Bare and eroded areas were carefully inspected for cultural materials. Shovel tests were to be excavated
primarily in areas adjacent to transmission pole structures that are proposed for replacement where ground
surface visibility was poor and/or in areas with a potential for buried cultural deposits. It was planned
that if any cultural resource sites were found, then additional shovel tests were to be dug to aid in defining
the site boundaries and the site contents. All shovel tests were 35 to 40 cm diameter holes that were
excavated 20 cm levels with all fill being screened through one-quarter inch wire mesh to determine if
any artifacts were present. Because all of the survey area is in upland areas lacking any alluvial soils, it is
assumed that any prehistoric cultural materials would occur within the upper 50 cm of soil deposits. Thus,
most shovel tests were not dug any deeper than 50 to 60 cm below ground surface.
Any cultural resource sites that were discovered during the field survey were to be recorded on State of
Texas Archeological Site Forms, and sketch maps of each site were to be drawn in the field. Site
locations would also be plotted on USGS maps and on aerial photographs. The survey had a âno
collectionâ policy. Therefore, there will be no artifacts to curate at TARL at the conclusion of the project.

SURVEY RESULTS

All previously described high-probability areas were intensively surveyed with no cultural resource sites
being found. Ground surface visibility was found to be good in areas in and around Blue Creek, East
Mustang Creek, Jones Creek, Mott Slough and at the two high-probability areas for historic period sites.
All of the survey area on East Mustang Creek was in plowed fields. The survey area on Blue Creek had
been channelized. In addition to the deep sloping banks of the channelized creek, there was also an
adjacent artificial drainage ditch that ran parallel with the transmission line corridor to the south of the
creek (Figure 17). Both the creek banks and the ditch provided good exposures of subsurface deposits.
Sections of transmission line adjacent to Highway 71 that were surveyed typically had good ground
surface visibility. Portions of the transmission line corridor adjacent to the highway frequently exhibited
disturbances related to the highway construction (Figure 18) and previous cultivation. In particular, rice
farming appears to have disturbed and generally flattened the terrain.
Ground surface visibility was more variable near the El Campo Substation on the south side of Tres
Palacios Creek. The area immediately northeast of the substation appears to have about three feet of
introduced fill dumped on the original ground surface. Furthermore, some areas in this stretch of the
transmission line corridor have been disturbed by the construction of FM 653 and businesses such as a car
parts store and a carwash. Thick grasses covered the ground surface in other areas adjacent to this creek
necessitating shovel testing (Figure 19). None of the shovel tests in areas adjacent to Tres Palacios Creek
55

revealed the Edna fine sandy loam topsoil that is mapped county soil survey as being in this area. Perhaps
this A horizon soil has been completely eroded away by previous agricultural practices. A total of eight
shovel tests were excavated to aid in the assessment of high-probability areas. The soil profiles of these
shovel tests are shown in the Appendix.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

A cultural resource survey for LCRAâs portions of the proposed El Campo-Ricebird-Nada Transmission
Line Upgrade and Substation Addition Project was conducted by LCRAâs Cultural Resources Services
staff in late February and early March 2012. The investigation focused on high-probability areas for
unrecorded cultural resource sites. These high-probability areas consisted of areas adjacent to five steam
channels and two locations where historic maps indicated that former houses and/or outbuildings had
once been situated. No cultural resource sites were found as a result of the work.
Based on the results of the investigation, it does not appear that the proposed construction of this project
will affect any cultural resource sites that are eligible or potentially eligible for formal designation as
SALs. The LCRA Cultural Resources Services staff recommends that LCRAâs proposed construction be
allowed to proceed, as currently planned. However, standard emergency discovery provisions are
applicable to this project. Should the construction personnel uncover any presently unknown buried
archeological features during construction work, then work will cease in the immediate area of the
discovery and the LCRA Cultural Resource Services staff will be notified so that the find can be assessed
in consultation with the THC. In such a situation, work can continue in other areas where no archeological
materials are present.

INTRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Turkey Bend Resource Area is a 1,316-acre group of LCRA-owned parcels located on the north shore of
Lake Travis approximately 30 airline miles northwest of Austin (Figure 20). It has 4. 8 miles of shoreline
when about 178 acres are submerged below the normal pool of the lake (LCRA 2006:11). The property
has been intermittently surveyed for cultural resources beginning in the late 1970s and through the early
1980s for various fence construction and brush management projects, then more intensively and
systematically beginning in the late 1990s. The most recent investigations were designed to fill in known
gaps and in response to renewed brush control efforts in 2009 and continuing through 2012. The entire
1,316 acres is considered to be investigated through reconnaissance-level survey, and perhaps 80 percent
investigated by moderate to intensive level survey. This includes lands down to the original river
channel. Areas with potential for deeply buried cultural materials have not been systematically explored.
To date, 78 archaeological sites with 87 total components consisting of four historic component sites, 74
prehistoric component sites, and nine sites with both historic and prehistoric components, have been
recorded at Turkey Bend. Historic sites date from the earliest known documented use of Turkey Bend
beginning in 1865 through sale to LCRA in the late 1930s, with indications of continuing land use
through the 1950s. These sites demonstrate ongoing farming and ranching activities consistent with
economic pursuits throughout the region. There is a detailed historic background section, specific to
Turkey Bend, included in this report.
Artifacts at prehistoric sites may date to Paleoindian times, although most dateable artifacts are from the
Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods. Open campsites, rockshelters, mixed use (multipurpose), lithic
scatters, and lithic procurement sites are all present and are located across all of Turkey Bend, but sites
are generally more scarce in the western uplands than elsewhere. Site use ranges from intensive to
ephemeral, and appears to capture a broad range of activities. Readers can get additional information in
the prehistoric background section of the larger annual report.
The following report presents the information known about these sites and makes recommendations for
State Archeological Landmark status and by extension, management options for the sites and the
property. Site descriptions are commensurate with research potential.
Of the 78 sites, four, all prehistoric open camps, are considered to be eligible for formal SAL status.
These are sites 41BT391, 41TV1850, 41TV2360, and 41TV2361. Twenty-four additional sites, including
two historic components, are either potentially eligible or of unknown eligibility, and the remaining 50
sites are considered to be fully documented and ineligible for SAL status (Figure 22).
This report is one of a series of summary reports on LCRA properties that have been included in the
annual report over the past few years. It also serves as mitigation for a brush clearing event that took
place in 2011 without appropriate THC review (Prikryl 2011).

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

Turkey Bend is located along the Colorado River on what is now Lake Travis in the Edwards Plateau
ecoregion of central Texas within the Balcones Canyonlands and just east of the Edwards Plateau
Woodland (Griffith et. al 2007). It is about 40 km (25 miles) west of the Balcones Escarpment, at
elevations ranging from about 640 feet above mean sea level (ft msl) along the original, pre-dam river
channel to 840 ft msl at some of the higher locations, with most of the nonfloodplain portion of the
landform between 700 and 800 ft msl. This is about 200-300 feet higher than what could be considered
the edge of the Blackland Prairie as seen along the Colorado River at its junction with Barton Creek in
Austin.
Lake Travis was formed as a result of the construction of Mansfield Dam, originally referred to as the
Marshall Ford reservoir and Marshall Ford Dam. The dam, completed in 1942, was designed to manage
flooding along the river and to generate electricity. It has a top elevation of 750 ft msl and a "normal"
pool elevation of 681 ft msl. Historic elevations have ranged from 614 feet in 1951 to 710 feet in 1991.
The lake, when at normal pool, covers over 19,000 acres (lcra.org, 2012). Lake formation radically
changed the interactions of people who settled along the river, effectively severing cross-river ties.
The Colorado River can be measured as running for some 500 miles from its headwaters in the southern
High Plains to where it empties into the Gulf of Mexico at Matagorda. It drains a total area of over
42,000 square miles (Blum and Velastro 1994). Turkey Bend is located about midway between the two
endpoints. The resistant bedrock geology suggests a relatively stable river course throughout the
Holocene period, with the lower Colorado River firmly entrenched to bedrock 12,000 years ago (Collins
1995:369) and the confluence of the Concho and Colorado rivers by about 10,000 years ago (Blum and
Lintz 1993). While subsequent valley fill was subjected to varying degrees of aggradation and
downcutting, the landform creating the bulk of Turkey Bend has been stable throughout human history.
Understanding the depositional sequence of the lower floodplain would, like nearby Shafer Bend (Hixson
and Prikryl 2012), require substantial additional work to develop hypotheses such as that for the deep
alluvial deposits at Double Horn Creek (Prikryl et. al 2004:24).
Geologically, Turkey Bend is underlain primarily by the Lower Cretaceous Cow Creek Limestone and
Hammett Shale (undivided) formation with the limestone portion often honeycombed due to dissolved
fossils with sand and gravel often present (Barnes 1981). The shale portion at times also contains pebbles
and cobbles, and oyster shells are often seen toward the top of the formation. This formation forms most
of the higher, steeper portions of the bend. In a topographically similar but less extreme setting is found
the earlier Sycamore Sand formation, comprised of reddish sand, silt, clay and conglomerates formed of
Paleozoic and Precambrian rocks. These are distinctively visible along the western slopes of the bend.
There are small areas of somewhat younger Hensell Sand along the northern reaches of the property that
expend into other components of the Glen Rose Limestone and Travis Peak formation. Hensell Sand is in
many respects similar to the Sycamore Sand. The floodplain portion of the property is recent (Holocene)
alluvium containing gravel, sand, silt and clay and can be up to 35 feet in thickness. This formation has
the greatest potential for containing intact, buried cultural materials.

A description of the soils at Turkey Bend is complicated by an artificial descriptive boundary formed by
the Burnet/Travis county line (SSURGO 2012). The most egregious of these are where soils mapped
Eckrant in Burnet County become Tarrant soils in Travis County, and where Heaton soils in Burnet
County become Travis soils in Travis County. For this report, the descriptors for Travis County
(Werchan et. al 1974) have been assigned for the corresponding soils in Burnet County.
The overwhelming majority of Turkey Bend is covered by Tarrant series soils. Tarrant series soils are
typically found in upland settings on hills, ridges and slopes over limestone. At Turkey Bend they cooccur primarily with the Cow Creek Limestone/Hammett Shale formation. The soils are typically stony
clay and rarely deeper than 30 cm before limestone bedrock is encountered.
Travis series soils occupy the gradual slopes corresponding with the Sycamore Sand formation on the
southeastern portion of the bend. Travis soils are typically deep (when the clay B horizons are included)
sandy or gravelly soils that formed in alluvium. The soil profile can reach 4 m in depth before the sandy
clay loam C horizon is reached, although the A horizon rarely exceeds 35 cm.
Pedernales series soils are found across the lower terraces, and for the purposes of this report, the mapped
extent of the soils have been expanded to include the floodplain down to the original (recent) river
channel. Pedernales soils have a surface layer of reddish-brown fine sandy loam, about 20 cm thick, over
successive B horizons that are sandy clay or clay loams to a final depth of about 200 cm where the
pinkish-gray C horizon overlies limestone bedrock.
There are some very minor areas of Altoga, Brackett, Krum and Volente soils along the northern property
boundaries. These are inconsequential in area and are not discussed further.
In general, the Edwards Plateau is considered a transition zone between areas to the west, where there is
less rainfall, and to the east, where humidity levels increase due to the Gulf of Mexico (Griffith et. al
2007:45). The result is a gradation of plants and animals with increasing xeric tolerance. Mean annual
precipitation is calculated at 26-34 inches per year with between 230 and 260 frost-free days (Griffith et.
al 2007:52). Turkey Bend, located near the eastern edge of the Plateau, is more likely to see established
oak savanna in upland settings interspersed with more mesic species such as baldcypress and sycamore
considered to be likely remnants of once more widespread populations, possibly from the Pleistocene era,
surviving in sheltered areas (Griffith et. al 2007:50). On drier exposures sotol, acacia and mesquite as
well as seemingly ubiquitous Ashe juniper (cedar) are present. The spread of cedar has been fueled by
increased fire suppression in recent times.
An aspect of Turkey Bend that is unique to LCRA properties is its division between the eastern and
western sections. This is a result of the owners of this inholding not selling the entirety of their parcels to
LCRA, although they were required to relinquish lands below an elevation of 714 ft msl for permanent
flood easement. As a result, the east and west portions of the property are connected at two locations
where lowlying drainages cross between the two sides.

68

Figure 24. Locations of archaeological sites in respect to soil associations.

69

Turkey Bend, for the purposes of this report, has been divided into three descriptive physiographic zones:
uplands, high terrace edges, and floodplains. The floodplain zone lies between the present river channel
and the near-flood pool elevation of 700 ft msl. This zone is a characterized by alluvial soils (Pedernales)
and a fluctuating reservoir, resulting in periods of inundation followed by encroaching vegetation, as well
as numerous other impacts during interim periods (Malof 1999). Along some higher portions of the
landform brushy and woody vegetation such as huisache and mesquite can become established.
The high terrace edge is located between 700 ft msl and near 800 ft msl. As the name implies it is formed
by the high edge of the upland terrace and is in either the Cow Creek Limestone/Hammet Shale
formation, where the drop to the floodplain is very steep and pronounced, or the Sycamore Sand
formation, which can be more of a gradual slope, especially to the southeast. Soils are Tarrant and Travis,
with chert and quartzite cobbles common in the Travis soils. Vegetation consists of sometimes very
dense juniper, and mesquite with established oak trees in places.
The uplands extend outward from the high terrace edge and are mostly upon Cow Creek
Limestone/Hammett Shale and Sycamore Sands, with a lesser amount of Hensell Sand. Soils are mostly
of the shallow Tarrant series, and there is no appreciable difference in vegetation between the upland zone
and the high terrace edge.

HISTORIC BACKGROUND

The choice to make the settlement of Waterloo as the capital of the Republic of Texas in 1840 led to rapid
growth in Travis County in the post-war years. Despite disputes over the location of the capital, settlers
found that Travis County offered ample natural resources that would support agriculture and the raising of
livestock. Between 1850 and 1860, farmland in the county increased from 73,300 acres to 1,363,500
acres. Many farm communities sprung up along the Colorado River, which bisects Travis County,
beginning in the 1850s. By 1890, over half of the countyâs population lived in these small communities
(Smyrl 2011a).
In 1852, roughly 1,000 square miles was carved out of Travis, Bell, and Williamson counties to create
Burnet County. Previously, settlement in the area had been minimal due to the proximity of Burnet to the
frontier. However, the presence of several companies of Texas Rangers in the 1840s and 50s encouraged
settlers to begin communities in the county (Smyrl 2011b). Of the early settlements, the closest to Turkey
Bend were the Burnet and Smithwick communities. Railroad construction in the1880s connected the
towns of Burnet, Marble Falls, and Llano to the larger markets in Austin. Although many ranchers
profited from increased contact to larger economic markets, many small communities began to disappear
by the twentieth century as residents moved closer to the railroads.
The Turkey Bend property is derived from three original patents: the C. Lane Survey, the H. Phillips
Survey, and the H. Vickers Survey. These were granted in 1845 by the Republic of Texas (Lane), and the
State in 1846 (Vickers) and 1850 (Phillips).

70

It is unclear when the first settlement on what is now LCRA property occurred, but it almost certainly
predates 1865, when the Henry Thomas Lodge met âin Lodge room (sic) near the residence of Bro. John
F. Burtonâ (Debo 1979a:264) at what was then known as Lodge Valley. Charter members included
Burton, M. Cox, J. Vickers, H. L. Hensel, and Calvin Hall. The lodge moved to Smithwick in 1876, and
at some point the community was renamed Turkey Bend, presumably in recognition of the numerous wild
turkeys that were present.
Debo refers to Turkey Bend as a âpioneer hamlet,â and a sketch map (Spicewood Area Historical Group
1996) shows a community located far down on the bend, near the river, and just west of the Burnet
County line. Debo describes the Spanish Oak School as being in the Turkey Bend community, and states
that it was more commonly referred to as the Turkey Bend School. The school was in operation prior to
1899 and operated at least until 1942, and possibly as late as 1948, when it was consolidated with the
Smithwick school district (Smyrl 2012). A photo from 1902 shows the students in attendance. A longtime resident of the Turkey Bend area, Mr. David Gorham, states that although the school originally was
located within the bend, in later years it was located on the Brown ranch, which is north of the LCRA
park (David Gorham, personal communication, January 2012).

71

A topographic map from 1901, with culture revised in 1906, combined with a 1936 Spicewood map,
shows a dispersed community with perhaps six structures across a portion of Turkey Bend (Figure 26). A
school is not shown as such, but Spanish Oak Church is clearly mapped just west of the Burnet/Travis
County line, and is almost certainly the location of recorded archaeological site 41BT322. No mention of
a church has been found in historical records, but it is likely that church services were held in the school
building at this location on what is now LCRA property. It is also unknown where the Masonic Lodge
was located. A lodge might have been a communal property and may have sustained such status as a
school or church after its departure.

Economic Activities
The main economic pursuits at Turkey Bend were clearly farming and ranching, perhaps with an
emphasis on the former. On 1936 maps commissioned by LCRA (see Methods section for more
information), the lower terraces are all marked as âcultivated fieldsâ (Figure 27). Photographic evidence
shows a number of the Halls, along with Lewises and Dennistons, as members of the Farmers Union, a
collective bargaining organization that was an offshoot of the Grange (Spicewood Area Historical Focus
Group 1996:46). Statements made during probate hearings describe fences, dwellings, houses, barns,
outbuildings, and âappurtenancesâ being occupied continuously by families and tenants for cultivation
and pasture. The estate of H. S. Phillips (junior), in 1935, listed 10 cattle, one horse, and 85 goats.
In the small communities of Burnet and Travis counties, agriculture was fundamental to sustained
existence. Land was cultivated to grow corn, wheat, and cotton for personal use and for sale at market.
Oral histories indicate cotton was the primary cash crop and pecans a major secondary harvest, while corn
and other grains were kept for personal use. The Travis Peak community, located downstream from
Turkey Bend, and the Smithwick community, located upstream, primarily grew cotton for sale in nearby
Marble Falls and Austin.
Many acres of land, however, were devoted to the raising of livestock. Although commercial livestock
breeding was not a primary vocation for ranchers in Turkey Bend, a threat to the domestic sale of cattle in
the United States affected ranchers at every level of cattle raising.
Texas Fever, sometimes called Splenetic Fever and often called Tick Fever, shut down cattle sales
between southern and northern states at varying times and degrees between the 1860s and 1930s. Tick
Fever is a disease carried by the parasite Pyrosoma bigeminum through cattle ticks, Boophilis bovis.
Although the origin of the tick to southern cattle has not been determined, the first recorded case in the
United States occurred in 1814 (Havins 1948). While southern cattle afflicted with Texas Fever showed
minor signs of the disease â decreased weight and milk production â northern cattle died from contact
with the illness.
Texas, like other states, developed an agricultural experiment station to research crop and livestock
production (Hill 2011). The Texas Agricultural Experiment Station researched methods of tick
eradication and helped develop the dipping vat method. Early methods included the use of crude oil and

coal tar, but by 1910 it was determined that white arsenic was the most effective measure. An important
aspect of the experiment station included disseminating information to the public. Although Texas
ranchers were aware of Texas Fever and how to prevent it, many simply did not see the need to spray or
dip cattle that were not going to be sold out of state.
In Texas, enforcement of tick eradication and quarantine lines began in 1893 when the Texas Legislature
created the Texas Live Stock Sanitary Commission. At the onset, the Commission, made up of three
men, had the power to establish quarantine lines and make rules regarding the movement of livestock.
Beginning in 1913, and then in 1917 through 1920, the Texas Legislature gave the Sanitary Commission
greater power of enforcement in the mandatory dipping of cattle. The legislation also created more
oversight at the county level by giving the county commissioners courts responsibility for three main
tasks: allocating county funds for the construction or rental of dip vats, appointing tick inspectors, and
collecting fines for noncompliance.
The partnership between county commissioner courts and the Texas Live Stock Sanitary Commission in
maintaining quarantine lines and overseeing mandatory eradication for all levels of cattle raisers
effectively controlled the disease. By 1935, Travis and Burnet counties were relatively tick free. Dipping
vats became obsolete by the 1960s due to tick control and new, more efficient methods of extermination.
There is a single known dipping vat at Turkey Bend (41TV2397) (Figure 28).

While not unique to Turkey Bend, the construction of below-ground cisterns was a fairly common means
of storing water. Oral histories indicated that cisterns rarely provided sufficient water for household
needs and were commonly supplemented with water drawn from the river, and in the case of Turkey
Bend, an enhanced spring vent (Figure 29) along the main eastern drainage was in common use (Destry
Kittman, personal communication, August 6, 2012).

75

Figure 29. Enhanced spring vent (at scale) along stream near 41TV1850 and 41TV1851.

Cisterns were also used to keep food items such as milk and butter cool, performing double duty much in
the way root cellars did, which in some cases were primarily storm shelters. Monitoring of cistern
removal resulted in the following summary (Hixson 2012):
Two basic cistern designs were encountered during the monitoring at Turkey Bend
(Figure 30). The twin cisterns at the 41TV1857 homestead were of the beveled-shoulder
design (Denton 2011). They are somewhat unusual in that their floors were not lined
with masonry. Instead, the upper surface of the limestone bedrock was thickly coated
with lime mortar to serve as the bottom the cistern. The cisterns at 41BT201 and
41BT323 are shaped like inverted funnels and perhaps are variants of the bottle-shape
design (Denton 2011). These funnel-shaped cisterns are both semi-masonry, with only
the upper portion lined with mortared stone and the rest the cistern cavity simply coated
with a thin layer of lime and concrete mortar. The concrete may represent later
resurfacing. Unlike the semi-masonry cisterns discussed by Denton (2011), the Turkey
Bend examples were not excavated into solid rock but into the cobbly clay terrace
deposits. Most of the Muleshoe Bend cisterns on the south side of the Colorado River
were also excavated into the same formation (Hixson 2009). Clearly cisterns could be
excavated into this relatively soft material without the need of a masonry lining. The
41BT201 semi-masonry cistern still held water after being abandoned for at least 80
years.

76

None of the Turkey Bend cisterns have intake holes on the shoulders or on the surviving
portions of the neck. The rainwater must have flowed either directly into the cisternsâ
opening from the roof or from an above-ground intake pipe set into the now-missing parts
of neck. Also, no outtake line exists in these cisterns so that water could be pumped out.
However, the neck openings are all large enough for a bucket to be lowered in, and this
may have been the method used for extracting water. Indeed, oral histories indicate that a
pulley and bucket system was used.
The 41TV1857 homesteaders had enough means to construct two fully lined (except for
the floors) masonry cisterns. The homesteaders at the other two sites in Turkey Bend
may have been less well off since they could not afford to completely line their cisterns
with stone or brick. Another possibility is that these semi-masonry cisterns at Turkey
Bend, and at Muleshoe as well, were built at a later date when Portland cement was made
available. However, portions of the 41BT201 and 41BT323 cisterns have a lime mortar
under the concrete so it would appear that the concrete represents later resurfacing. In
any case, the cobbly clay terrace material provided enough structural integrity so that
masonry linings were unnecessary except to shore up the softer surface soil. The semimasonry cisterns of the Lake Travis area demonstrate the resourcefulness of the early
homesteaders who altered time-honored building methods to better suit local
environmental conditions.
Economic diversification was attempted. In 1919 Brown Boultinghouse leased his property to J. R. Yett,
a member of a prominent local family, and J. W. Hunnicut for oil and gas exploration. It is unknown
whether any wells were actually drilled, but it is assumed that the venture was not successful. In 1925
Brown Boultinghouse leased 225 acres for $400 to a Tom Heine for timber cutting. Heine was allowed to
build gates and roads and permitted to camp. Timber cutting apparently was a successful enterprise. In
1927, Hall traded timber rights to J. H. Shaffer in the amount of $500 for 350 acres. Numerous cedar
stumps bear witness to these activities. One of these âcedar chopperâ camps may be represented by site
41TV536.

Family Ties
Following the various chains of title becomes quite complicated, largely due to intermarriages between
closely associated families, often after the death of a spouse. Surviving children were not necessarily
adopted, retaining their original surnames as new children were added to recombined families. It was not
uncommon for there to be 10 or 12 children under one roof. Various families apparently consolidated
land holdings through time, but also seemed to make land sales based on perceived future inheritances.
There are four structures seen on the maps commissioned by LCRA in 1936 that have family names
associated with them (see Figure 27). These are, from west to east, Phillips, Boultinghouse, Hall and
Burton. Two other structures are mapped, apparently as barns or unoccupied structures (41BT326 â with
one cistern; and 41TV1857 â with two cisterns). The map did not extend above the 740 ft msl contour, so
any potential additional structures at higher elevations may still have been present at that time (see Figure
77

27). The 1936 Smithwick USGS map shows five structures on the south side of the bend that correspond
with the four mentioned above while the fifth aligns with the former location of the two cisterns at
41TV1857. This map matches the 1909 Burnet map on an east west line about half way up the bend. The
latter map shows the Spanish Oak Church very near the plotted location of 41BT322 and another structure
near the location of 41TV536 (see Figure 26).

As stated above, Turkey Bend is located on original Texas land survey (OTSL) Vickers, Phillips, and
Lane tracts. Henry Sampson Phillips (Sr.) was awarded a 640-acre headright in 1850. He died at his
residence in Bastrop County in 1855 leaving behind two minor children, Emily and Henry Sampson Jr.
John F. Burton stated that in 1858 the minor children, and presumably Emily Phillips (now Emily Burton)
were living with him in Burnet County, suggesting settlement at about the same time or perhaps shortly
after 1855. John and Emily had several children, including Silas Sylvanus Burton (S. S.). S. S. Burton
and H. S. Phillips Jr. were thus half-brothers. Emily and H. S. Jr were in Utopia by 1885 and in San
Diego, California by 1888.
Calvin Hall (Figure 31) and J. F. Burton were among the 1865 charter members of the Henry Thomas
Lodge. There were eight officers present at the first meeting (Debo 1979a:264). Calvin Austin Hall
moved to Turkey Bend in 1860 (Debo 1979b:133), although it is unclear exactly where he lived. He
apparently did not own property in the park area until 1871, when he purchased the entirety of the 640
acre Lane survey for 320 dollars in gold from what appeared to be a series of speculators.

Historical Commission.

S. S. Burton began accumulating lands on the eastern portion of the bend, and by 1909 he owned the
eastern half. He was married to Mary Boultinghouse, who was the cousin of Brown Boultinghouse.
Brown Boultinghouse was the ninth of 14 children of Daniel Boultinghouse, for who nearby
Boultinghouse Mountain was named, reportedly due to the large numbers of bears killed by Daniel.
Brown was married to Nancy Burton, the daughter of J. F. Burton. Martha Jane Boultinghouse, sister of
Brown, was married to H. S. Phillips Jr.
The Hall family, however, largely married outside of the afore-mentioned families, other than a couple of
marriages into the Boultinghouse clan. Calvin Hall sold his interest in the Lane survey to S. S. Burton in
1909. Henry William Hall sold his interest in the Vickers survey to H. S. Phillips Jr. in 1885. The Halls
apparently had no direct ownership or use of the Turkey Bend properties until about 1934, when,
apparently in business or other arrangement with J. H. Shaffer (of Shaffer Bend) they became the owners
of the central in-holding, including the house marked as the Hall place on the 1936 map. This same
structure is described in a metes and bounds survey as being present in 1885, at which time it was owned
by the Burton family before passing variously through Walls, Phillips, Heffington (as at Muleshoe Bend,
[Utley 1996]) Pangle and Shaffer. Certain title transfers note that the property was being rented by
Charles Hobbs in 1915. The Phillips place was being rented after 1923, when H. S. Jr. and Martha Jane
Phillips had moved to Spicewood. The Burton Placed was leased by S. S. Burton to Roscoe Burton at the
time of transfer to LCRA. The Boultinghouse place likewise remained with Boutinghouse heirs until the
time of sale to LCRA.
Additional historical research was conducted by Bonnie Wilson on the later Burton residency, helping to
understand lifeways. In county records, Silas is often referred to as âS.S.â and is called âUncle Siâ by his
79

living family members. The majority of information known on the life of Silas is through newspaper
articles interviewing Silas in his later years. Silas grew up on the land his father, John, had purchased in
Turkey Bend. Like many ranchers living in Burnet and Travis County at the time, the Burtons grew
cotton. According to Silas, John Burton owned a cotton gin (location unknown). When Silas was six
years old, his right arm was cut off after getting caught in his fatherâs gin. In a 1958 news article, Silas
proudly remarked, âI chop wood, pick cotton, roll cigarettes, and eat all with one armâ (Henderson 1958).
Historical research of the communities around Turkey Bend and the interviews of Silas Burton shed light
on some aspects of life for people living along the Colorado River in Burnet and Travis counties at the
turn of the twentieth century. At that period, there were a number of communities around Turkey Bend.
The larger of those were Spicewood, Burnet, and Marble Falls. However, a number of small communities
existed between these larger hubs and included Clover, Cypress Mill, Corwin, Fall Creek, Double Horn,
Haynie Flat, Marshy Springs, Smithwick, Spanish Oak Falls, Rockvale, Mud, and Shovel Mountain.
Relating the history of each community is beyond the perimeter of this study. However, it is important to
this report that there existed extensive family connections between each of the communities. For
instance, the Burtonâs extended family lived in communities all around Turkey Bend, as documented here
and below by the Spicewood Area Historical Group (1996).
Interdependence among the communities was integral to sustain livelihood and was on one level based on
these familial connections. The distance between people living in these communities to markets, post
offices, schools, and churches created a general dependence between neighbors. W.L. Burnham of the
Marshy Springs community related the following in an article for the Burnet Bulletin in 1936: âIn those
times our nearest market was Austin. When we needed supplies for the Community the neighbors would
deputize someone to go to Austin to buy the community supplies.â
In the 1958 American Statesman article on Silas Burton, Nat Henderson describes similar trips made by
Burton and other community men to Austin. In the nineteenth century, Burton walked along caravans led
by oxen to carry supplies from Marble Falls to Austin. Trips to market also included those in neighboring
communities. Silas Burton is listed as a having an account at two general stores around the Spicewood
Community.
This interdependence between neighbors and the research collected on Silas Burton may explain the cattle
dipping vat located on the Burton homestead tract. As mentioned earlier, in 1917 county commissionerâs
courts in Texas were given the authority to allocate money for the rental of dipping vats and hire tick
inspectors to travel the county enforcing mandatory cattle dipping. Although dipping vats had been
located in Travis County prior to 1920, stricter legislation on enforcement began at the end of January
1919 when Travis County was officially quarantined. For men like Silas Burton, who did not raise cattle
for the sole purpose of commercial sale across the state, mandatory dipping laws would have been a
financial encumbrance and a drain on time he could be spending doing the numerous other tasks
necessary to managing a homestead. The burden of compliance would have been made easier if Burton
and his three neighbors on Turkey Bend paid for and built the dipping vat together. Another possibility
would be that Burton paid for the construction of the dipping vat and the Travis County Commissionerâs
Court rented it for community use. A final possibility is that tenants who rented land for cattle grazing in

80

Turkey Bend from the LCRA after the land was conveyed to them in 1939 built the vat. There are no
records available that indicate the location of dipping vats in Travis County.
In 1939, LCRA inventoried the Burton tract and found there to be a five-room house, barn, fences, and a
cistern. The cattle dipping vat is not included on the inventory, although the only known nearby cistern is
that located to the south of the homesite, near the dipping vat.
The following section provides archival and other information on the four structures associated with
names on the 1936 map, starting at the west side and proceeding eastward. Archaeological descriptions
follow in the Historic Site Descriptions section.

Phillips Place
The Phillips house site is located within land patented to Harris Vickers by the State of Texas in 1846. At
the time, the property was in Bastrop County. Field notes indicate Vickers was residing in the Sabine
County area in far East Texas when 26 labors of land were surveyed in his name. He was still residing
there in 1861, when he deeded the land to John B. Gaines, also of Sabine County. Gaines was a
prominent name in the early days of East Texas, and Gaines Ferry across the Sabine at present State
Highway 21 was the entrepot for travelers and westward-migrating settlers along the Old San Antonio
Road (Burnet County Deed Records: B/21; E/283; and E/284).
John B. Gaines executed a deed of trust on his Burnet County survey to Mathew D. Cooper and Company
in the 1860s. That set in motion a series of legal maneuverings on the land between the two families.
Events surrounding land transactions and questionable conveyances have clouded much of the landâs
early history. As an unidentified abstractor noted:
From the time when John B. Gaines mortgaged the Harris Vickers survey to M.
D. Cooper. . . until the attempt to partition the survey was made by E. B. McHenry,
receiver and H. W. Hall [1885] . . . the title seems to be in rather a chaotic stateâ¦In the
mean time (sic) there had been some squatters, and others with more or less precarious
claims, living on the small subdivisions of the survey for a time, all of whom seem to
have recognized the superior titles, as there have been no conflicting claims. . . . (LCRA
land records, n.d.)
The landâs association with the Hall family is significant because it represents ties to the early days of
settlement in Turkey Bend. Patriarch Calvin Austin Hall (1818-1905) was a native of South Carolina. He
and his wife, Elizabeth West Cherry Hall (1823-1897) of North Carolina, came to Texas after living for a
short time in Tennessee. They settled in Bastrop County in 1851, but moved to Burnet County in 1860.
There they made their home in Turkey Bend (Debo, 1979b), although somewhere outside of present
LCRA property.
H. W. Hall, son of Calvin, died at Smithwick in 1918, and his wife died five years later. Both are buried,
along with other members of their families, in the Smithwick Cemetery. Their land subsequently passed
81

to Henry Sampson Phillips, Jr. (1856-1935), and his wife, Martha Jane Boultinghouse Phillips (18621950). The couple married in the late 1870s and lived at Turkey Bend on land not associated with
41BT195. According to a local history book, they moved to Spicewood in 1923, about the time they
acquired the Turkey Bend land under research. The couple had 12 children, 10 of whom lived to
maturity. H. S. Phillips died at Spicewood in 1935. Martha Phillips retained ownership of the family
land in question until 1938, when she deeded the 250 acres to the Lower Colorado River Authority
(Burnet County Probate Records: N/149; Burnet County Deed Records: 87/175).

Boultinghouse Place
Site 41BT201 is located on land patented to H. S. Phillips, Sr., in 1850. It originally contained 383.71
acres. Around the time he received the grant, Henry Sampson Phillips, Sr. wed widow Emily Maria
Johnson Barker, a native of New York. She had two children from her previous marriage to Leeman
Barker, and two with Phillips. The latter were Emily (Mrs. Robert G.) Alexander (also shown as Emma
Phillips) and Henry Sampson, Jr. The younger Phillips was born in 1856, after the death of his father the
previous year. Emily remarried to John Franklin Burton, who became the guardian of her two children by
H. S. Phillips. Seven additional children were born to Emily and John Burton (Debo 2, 1979: 244-245;
Burnet County Probate Records).
Although John F. Burton served as both stepfather and legal guardian to the two Phillips children, final
settlement of the Phillips estate did not occur until the mid-1870s. During that time, Burton supervised
the Phillips headright lands, initiating legal action against Calvin Hall over the validity of the original
survey. At question were the northern calls of the survey. Both Burton and Hall claimed legal title to the
disputed lands. The lawsuit worked its way through district court very slowly and ended with a decision
82

for Hall in the late 1870s. Burton eventually appealed his case to the Texas Supreme Court, but lost in
1880 when the lower court upheld the earlier decision (Burnet County District Court Records: Cause No.
557).
Shortly after in the early 1880s, J. F. and Emily Burton conveyed their interests in the Phillips land to
their children. In the ensuing years, ownership consolidated under Brown D. Boultinghouse (b. 1856), a
Smithwick native who had married Nancy Burton in 1877. Consolidation included the acreage earlier
disputed by Nancyâs father in his long-running lititgation against Calvin Hall. Nancy Burton
Boultinghouse died in 1889, and in 1901 Brown Boultinghouse married Rosa (or Rosey) Lewis Rogers
(Burnet County Deed Records: O/149, P/519-520, 75/527, 183/130, and 72/112-113; Burnet County
Marriage Records, Debo, 1979b: 23-26).
Rosa Boultinghouse died in 1915, and Brown Boultinghouse died 11 years later. The land remained in
the ownership of Boultinghouse heirs until 1940, when they deeded it to the Lower Colorado River
Authority. Documents indicate that for at least part of their possession after the death of their father, they
continued to cultivate the land and to use it for agricultural purposes (Burnet County Deed Records:
89/275-279, 75/530, and 76/5).
A 1946 letter from W. S. Gideon of LCRA shows that a one-room house was then located on the
property. A related notation in the agency land files shows Mrs. Harvie Hensel of the Marble Falls area
acquired the house for scrap lumber (LCRA land files). (See expanded reference in Burton house land
history.)

Hall Place
The Hall place is not on LCRA property and has not been researched.

Burton Place
The Burton homestead tract, as conveyed to the Lower Colorado River Authority, contained 470.5 acres.
It included parts of the Cornelius Lane and H. S. Phillips surveys in Travis County. Since the site
straddles the line between the two surveys, the land title information on each is herein provided.
In 1850, the State of Texas granted 640 acres of land to Henry Sampson Phillips (see 41BT201 for further
description of Phillips family history). In 1876, Phillips sold 195 acres of land, including 45 acres in
Burnet County to John F. Burton. Eleven years later, Burton and his wife, Emily Maria Johnson Barker
Phillips, then residents of Uvalde County, deeded the Burnet County portion to Fannie P. Crane. The
Travis County portion went to S. S. Burton the following year. In 1889, Fannie Crane conveyed her tract
to S. S. Burton (Travis County Deed Records: 335/239, J/119, 141/580, 92/38, and 91/168).
Cornelius Lane of Bastrop County received his patent from the Republic of Texas during the summer of
1845, the year Texas was annexed to the United States. The year before, however, Lane formally
conveyed his interest in the patent to E. T. Merryman (also shown as Merriman) for $200. Merriman was
83

listed as a resident of Hays County in 1851, when he deeded the land to Henry E. Merriman of Bristol,
Stafford County, Connecticut. The deed contained the notation that the property was to be held âin trustâ
for E. T. Merrimanâs children (Travis County Deed Records: S/574, S/575, and S/576).
The next transaction involving the property apparently reflects the transfer of ownership through the
guardianship agreement. An 1871 deed from Sam Fusselman et al. to Calvin Hall notes that Henrietta
Merriman is the wife of Samuel Fusselman, and that in the deed, by power of attorney, she and her
husband are joined by James Merriman and Titus Merriman in the sale of 640 acres to Calvin Hall. The
deed further notes that the property is the same as conveyed to Henrietta, James, and Titus from E. T.
Merriman in 1851 (Travis County Deed Records: 27/140).
A 270.5 acre tract of the original 640 acres came into the possession of S. S. Burton in 1909 as the result
of a receiverâs deed. The deed references district court case number 25778, Henry W. Hall et al v. Ben
M. Rucker, which was a suit for partition of lands in the estate of Calvin and Eliza Hall, both deceased.
In its finding, the court ordered the sale of land, which resulted in Burtonâs title to a portion thereof
(Travis County Deed Records: 240/561).
There were apparently discrepancies in the transfer of ownership over the years, and a series of later
affidavits were used to resolve remaining issues of title. In 1922, S. S. Burton and H. S. Phillips gave
their statement that both were sons of Mrs. E. M. Burton, who was first married to Henry S. Phillips and
then J. F. Burton (Travis County Deed Records: 335/212).
In 1938, Hulbert Carpenter and Earl Naumann signed a statement in to help the Burton family clarify their
proof of possession. The affiants, longtime neighbors, provided the following details:
. . . there was a substantial fence capable of turning cattle completely enclosing
this property, and this fence was kept up and the gates were kept closed by S. S. Burton
from the time of his purchase of his property from the said C. C. Pierson, receiver, until
the present time. From March 24, 1909, through the year 1937, and afterward, S. S.
Burton claimed such property as his own under such deed . . . raising crops thereon, and
pasturing livestock thereon both for himself and on rental from his neighbors . . . that said
Roscoe Burton is now residing on the said land as the tenant of the S. S. Burton.
The statement further noted that S. S. Burton wed Mary Boultinghouse in 1893, and that both were still
living in 1938 (Travis County Deed Records: 602/383). The Carpenter and Naumann statement
supplemented and corroborated an affidavit filed a few days earlier by renter Roscoe Burton (Travis
County Deed Records: 602/379).
Together, the statements cleared any clouds in the title, which records indicate had occurred earlier than
Burtonâs possession of the land, and allowed S. S. and Mary Burton all rights to convey the property to
the Lower Colorado River Authority, which they did in October 1938. LCRA correspondence from 1946
provides some limited information on the structures that remained after the transfer of ownership. A
letter from general manager Max Starcke to Orville Buttery of Llano, vice-chairman of the LCRA board
noted:
84

Back in June 1945, E. O. Clark was the highest bidder for an old house and 22 pieces of
tin roofing located on the S. S. Burton tract, his bid being in the amount of $50.00.
According to the information we have, the appraisal made by Mr. Ross was $100.00 for
the old house and $75.00 for two rooms and shed. We cannot tell if the bids received
covered all the improvements located on the Burton place.
The Burton place is now leased by Ted Hall.
You might check with Mr. Ross and find out what he thinks about the place. Of course,
it may be possible that is in not in as good condition now as it was when Mr. Clark
looked at it. My understanding is that the house was beyond repair, but fifty dollars is
mightly little to pay for any lumber, as scarce as materials are now (LCRA land files).
Starckeâs copy of the letter bear the following handwritten notes: âMr. Buttery says these improvements
are worth 3 times as much as bid,â and âThese improvements sold to Mrs. Hensel.â A letter from W. S.
Gideon to Mrs. Harvie Hensel of the Marble Falls area, dated March 18, 1946, provides additional
information:
As near as I can tell, the Authority at one time owned a three room house located on the
S. S. Burton tract; a one room house located on the Brown Boultinghouse Estate tract; a
four room house located on the Nancy Singleton tract and an old house located on the
Swisher Estate Tract.
If you will advise me which house you are interested in, I will see if I can obtain some
definite information concerning it (LCRA land records).
Gideonâs description of the Burton house differs from a 1939 LCRA land record that shows the property
then included a five room house with shed and barns. It is possible that two of the rooms were of such
original minimal construction--something like a lean-to or shed addition--that they had deteriorated
beyond habitability by the time of the 1946 letter. Regardless, another note in the LCRA land files
indicates Mrs. Hensell intended to âtear the houses down and build a camp house with the lumberâ
(LCRA land files).
In October 1938, the Lower Colorado River Authority bought 71.09 acres of easement rights out of the
H.S. Phillips and Cornelius Lane surveys from Silas Burton for $1,919.43. The purchase of the easement
rights was necessary in case the construction of the Marshall Ford (Mansfield) Dam incurred damage
upon the Burton land. The following year, Burton conveyed the remaining 399.41 acres to LCRA for
$3700.00.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

The first known cultural resource survey in the Turkey Bend tracts was done by William Sorrow in 1977
for a fence project that ran across portions of the park (Sorrow 1977). His survey method involved
walking a criss-cross path over the proposed 5,775-foot route of the fence. No archeological sites were
recorded in the project area.
In 1980, Prewitt & Associates surveyed the boundary fence running along the north side of a subparcel
(Prewitt and Kotter 1980). As was the usual practice at the time, no shovel testing was done. The survey
did not locate any archeological sites in the project area.
In March 1981, Lone Star Archeological Services conducted a survey of another subparcel (Briggs 1981).
According to the report, the survey methods involved walking transects at 25 to 50 m intervals. Highprobability areas were more thoroughly inspected; these were defined as level areas, terraces near
streams, areas with surface chert gravels, and bedrock exposures which might contain bedrock features or
shelters. No mention was made of subsurface testing and it is doubtful any was done. The survey of the
400-acre tract was accomplished over a five-day period, during which three sites were recorded:
41TV535, 41TV536, and 41TV537. None of these sites were considered eligible for SAL designation.
However, testing of 41TV536 and 41TV537 was recommended if either site were threatened.
In September, 1981, Prewitt & Associates conducted a survey for an LCRA brush clearing project
(Prewitt and Laurens-Day 1981). Eleven sites (41BT189-199) were recorded in one portion and six sites
(41BT196 and 41BT200-41BT204) were recorded in another. Most of these sites are either lithic scatters
or procurement locales. Four of these sites are represented by a single isolated artifact. Avoidance was
recommended for three sites (41BT194-196) and hand clearing was recommended for three others
(41BT192 and 41BT201 and 202). All six of these sites were thought significant enough to be considered
for the NRHP. In addition to these sites, three others were also recommended for hand clearing but were
not considered eligible for NRHP listing.
LCRA archaeologists have conducted two small field surveys within the Turkey Bend tracts for
construction projects under annual blanket permits. These were intensive surveys with shovel testing in
accordance with the THCâs current minimum survey standards. The first of these surveys was done in
2006 for the entry station and camp host RV site, a project covering approximately 1.5 acre (Hixson et al.
2007). No archeological sites were recorded during the survey. The other survey was done early in 2008
on land leased to the Young Menâs Business League for development of the Sunshine Camp (Malof
2009). Five sites had already been recorded within this project area during earlier inventory surveys by
LCRA archaeologists beginning in the mid-1990s. Only one of these, 41TV1849, was to be impacted by
construction. Although this site was found to contain dense prehistoric camping debris, it was not
assessed as SAL-eligible because of the lack of discrete components or intact features.
In December 2010, the LCRA was informed that a private landowner had cleared brush on a small portion
of Turkey Bend adjacent to his property (LCRA Cultural Resource files). The clearing occurred within
41TV1857, a historic homestead site recorded during an earlier LCRA inventory survey. LCRAâs
86

Cultural Resource Services sent archaeologists to assess any possible damage to this site. Their visit
found that the area to the northwest of the twin cisterns had been cleared and superficially scraped with a
front-end loader. Few artifacts were seen on the scraped ground surface and no damage was noted to the
cistern collars, although the front end blade had come within inches of the masonry. Using shovel probes,
the investigators detected buried rocks â possible foundation stones â in the uncleared area to the
southeast of the cisterns.
The permitted demolition by LCRA of four cisterns at homestead sites in Turkey Bend was monitored in
May 2011 (Hixson 2012). The removal was done to remove possible toxic materials from illegal
dumping. The cisterns involved included the two located at 41TV1857, and one each at 41BT201 and
41BT323. Site 41BT323 was first recorded during an earlier inventory survey, as was 41TV1857 already
mentioned above, while 41BT201 is one of the sites recorded during Prewitt & Associatesâ 1981 survey.
All the cistern chambers contained modern trash, but no earlier material. The 41TV1857 cisterns had
wide, cylindrical chambers with beveled shoulders while those at the other two sites were funnel-shaped
and narrow, almost like wells (see Figure 30).
Also in spring, 2011, LCRA archaeologists made three trips to the Turkey Bend tracts to assess damage
done to archeological sites during an LCRA brush clearing project (LCRA Cultural Resource files).
Twenty-five sites, most recorded during inventory surveys, were known to be in the cleared areas. The
archeologists revisited 14 of these sites, including all eight that were currently assessed as potentially
significant. The damage to two potentially significant sites, 41BT322 and 41BT337, was assessed as
moderate, while the other potentially significant sites sustained no damage or else lay outside the areas
actually cleared. The damage to the archeological sites was reported to THC in a letter (Prikryl 2011).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND INVESTIGATIVE METHODS

The present project attempts to consolidate over three decades of investigations at Turkey Bend starting
with sporadic fence and brush clearing surveys around 1980. Beginning about 1994, then-LCRA
archaeologist Bruce Nightengale began systematic investigations of some of the larger LCRA parcels,
with an emphasis on historic settlement and lifeways. Dan Utley and Thad Sitton conducted numerous
oral histories with residents of Muleshoe Bend (Turner Farm), the Double Horn Community, Spicewood,
and Smithwick. While the over twenty hours of interviews have not been transcribed, portions were used
for two publications (Utley 1994; 1996). These oral histories provide information that inform on
common aspects of early- to mid-twentieth century life along the future Lake Travis. Utley also compiled
data on Turkey Bend, including deed and title records along with land records available at LCRA, and
drafted descriptions of historic sites known at the time. LCRA archaeologist Andrew Malof extracted
additional information from the files and other sources, and in 2011, Bonnie Wilson, then a student of
Dan Utley's, took on researching a recently discovered dipping vat (41TV2397), and in the process
uncovered valuable new information and summarized regional historic development. Charles Hixson
monitored permitted cistern removal at Turkey Bend with a resulting report (Hixson 2012), portions of
which are included within this report. Interviews with longtime residents and descendants have provided
additional glimpses into past lifeways.

A number of historical maps were reviewed. The earliest available map is the Blanco 1885, 1:250,000
USGS map. It covers the southern tip of Turkey Bend but has little cultural coverage overall and none for
the bend. The next available map is the Burnet, 1:250,000 USGS edition of 1909. This map covers the
northern half of the bend and shows road networks and structures. The Spicewood 1:62,500 edition of
1932 matches the southern edge of the Burnet 1909 Burnet map, and likewise shows roads and structures.
These early maps are all a bit crude (for example the county boundary is drawn incorrectly, and the river
meanders differently), and given the differences in scale and projection they can only approximate
physical reality (see Figure 26).
Perhaps the most important maps are a series apparently commissioned by LCRA that were surveyed and
drawn by the Bureau of Reclamation in 1936 (see Figure 27). These maps capture the entire Marshall
Ford (Lake Travis) basin prior to inundation. While they only covered elevations up to about the 750 ft
msl elevation, they are highly detailed at a scale of 1:500 and with 10-ft contours. In addition to roads,
fencelines, locations of cultivated fields, and selected other cultural improvements such as outbuildings
and stock tanks, houses are labeled with the names of occupants at the time. These maps georeference
very accurately with modern topographic maps.
As with these 1936 maps, four modern 1:24,000 maps meet at about the center of Turkey Bend. These
are the editions of Pace Bend, 1986; Smithwick, 1986, Spicewood; and Travis Peak, 1986 (see Figure 21).
These are revised versions of 1966 and 1967 versions of the same quads. None of the most recent maps
show structures, although they do show a dramatic increase in tree coverage. And while the 1967 Pace
Bend map shows the Hall Place as a residence, it disappears on the revised version, even though it is still
a habitable structure. Together, these maps demonstrate continuous occupation at Turkey Bend from the
late nineteenth through mid twentieth centuries. They are referenced in general terms throughout the
report, usually by their dates and/or names.
Prehistoric research draws on what is known about central Texas prehistory in general, and specifically
what has been observed at Turkey Bend. An unpublished model (Malof 2007) placed site distributions
within Binford's (1980) hunter-gatherer continuum, and while this report does not explicitly attempt the
same process, much of the underlying theoretical approach is informed by those discussions. A
generalized summary of the regional prehistoric cultural chronology is found in the introductory section
of this annual report.
Turkey Bend represents a microcosm of regional resource structure and can therefore be used to explore a
wide array of past human activity. Small campsites appear to represent single families or small groups,
perhaps during periods of fission, and larger camps are apparent expressions of larger groups and/or more
intensive levels of resource extraction. Upland lithic scatters demonstrate specific activities that compare
favorably with Binford's (1980) notion of logistical foraging. Raw lithic chert resources in the form of
gravel deposits, while not used intensively, were a final piece that potentially allowed prehistoric people a
fairly decent, localized subsistence base.
Prehistoric sites are defined variously as open camps, where burned rock and food remains (usually
mussel shell) or food processing artifacts (groundstone) are all present. The concept of a mixed-use site,
88

which could also be termed as multipurpose site, is used to describe sites that are not clearly camps in that
there are not obvious amounts of burned rock, but tools and/or food remains are present, indicating more
than ephemeral use. Lithic scatters contain chert debitage, and sometimes stone tools. Lithic
procurement sites are within chert resource areas where early stage stone tool acquisition is evident.
While there are a few small rockshelters present, they have minimal evidence of occupation and were
only suitable for very small groups for short periods of time.
The majority of sites at Turkey Bend are deflated or surficial and disturbed by historic ranching and later
land maintenance activities, and would be difficult to extract meaningful information from. They have
been examined at widely different times, by different people, and for different reasons. This report
depends on both site forms and field observations â the principal author has visited all the sites at Turkey
Bend â to make recommendations as to State Archeological Landmark (SAL) status. (There is no federal
involvement with this property at this time.) Sites are evaluated individually.
There are four sites considered by LCRA to be eligible for formal SAL status. Twenty sites are
considered to be either potentially eligible or to be of unknown eligibility, and would require additional
investigations in order to make a firm determination. The remaining 54 sites are considered to be fully
documented and are not felt to contain the information yield potential to qualify for SAL status. This last
category of sites is not, therefore, significant in a regulatory sense. But the sites as a whole, the
distribution, can be considered to have significance when placed within an interpretive, heuristic
framework. This report attempts some very rudimentary modeling of decision-making, particularly by
prehistoric inhabitants. The data is present to allow more rigorous hypotheses to be formulated and/or
tested.

HISTORIC SITE DESCRIPTIONS

41BT195 â The Phillips House
The Phillips place is located on the high point of an upland margin lobe that fronts the Colorado River to
the west. Soils are of the Tarrant series over the Sycamore Sand formation. Located on the western
portion of the park, no roads presently lead to the site, although a remnant road, bordered by rock,
approaches it from the northeast. As documented the site is about 150 feet in diameter, not including the
roadbed and old fencelines. Prior to recent brush-clearing activities, the site was densely covered by
almost impenetrable tassajillo and beebrush along with mesquite and juniper trees. Oak trees border the
perimeter of the site. It is now approachable from the lakeshore to the southeast.
The site consists of house remains, two cisterns (Figure 33), one of which has the remnants of a metal
hinged lid across a constricted collar opening (Figure 34), and the other of more standard design. The
cistern with the lid was inscribed with the initials 'LJ' and the apparent date "2,9, 1935." The two cisterns
are aligned on a north/south axis and are about 35 feet apart and are about 100 feet northeast of the high
gravel terrace edge. A chimney fall is located midway between the cisterns and about 20 feet to the west.
A rock rubble pile that may represent a second chimney is located about 30 feet to the northeast of the
89

more northerly cistern. The original access road, seen on the 1936 map, was bordered by a picket fence in
addition to the rock. Other picket fence remnants are present across the site, and the 1936 map shows the
fence coming up from the water's edge north of the site, traversing the terrace edge before crossing the
lobe directly in front of the house and exiting the site to the north.

Figure 33. 41BT195. Two cisterns to right and chimney foundation to left.

There was a fairly substantial trash pile located across the terrace edge about 140 feet south of the cistern
area. It contained typical glass and ceramics along with tractor parts, a headlight rim, a baking powder tin
and an evaporated milk can. Following the brush clearing event a Model T or similar automobile hood
was found, along with an axle rod. Due to the type of site and the general setting no shovel tests have
been excavated here.
The Phillips Place is probably the most well preserved of the historic homesites at Turkey Bend. It may
have been the largest house, given that there was probably a cistern on either side and perhaps had two
chimneys. The house may have been as large as 25 x 50 feet, with the long axis aligned east to west.
Because the cisterns were free of trash, they were able to be preserved and were covered semipermanently by non-invasive means.
Archival evidence indicates that the site was originally part of the Calvin Hall holdings, although as
mentioned elsewhere in this report squatters may have occupied various parts of the bend. The land
became owned by the Phillips in about 1923, the same time they moved to Spicewood. The apparent date
of 1935 on the cistern may correspond with the date of construction of the cistern or perhaps when the
cistern was modified. It is unlikely it represents the date of house construction, and the coincidence of the

90

date with the year of H. S. Phillips' death may be just that. The sale of the land just three years later to
LCRA appears to mark the end of site occupation.

Figure 34. Detail of cistern at 41BT195.

Despite the relatively well-preserved nature of the site it is considered to be fully documented. It lacks
the integrity to be considered for formal eligibility as an SAL. While it has some potential for interpretive
use, no avoidance or additional investigations are considered to be necessary.

41BT201 â The Boultinghouse House
Known as the Boultinghouse place on the 1936 map, this site is located on the edge of an upland divide
composed of the Sycamore Sand formation covered with Eckrant (Tarrant) soils supporting dense
tassajillo, beebrush and prickly pear within scattered mesquite trees. It is along the main road leading to
the floodplain terraces on the west side of the property. The site is about 100 feet in diameter.
The site consists of a cistern (now removed) (Figure 35) and various foundation remains along with a
relatively light trash scatter. The cistern was funnel-shaped and of partial masonry construction (Hixson
2012), very similar to that at 41BT323 (see below). Among the scattered foundation stones was a cement
step. Bricks and other building and fencing debris were also present. Artifacts were minimal near the site
center and consisted mostly of scattered flat glass, fencing and a single whiteware fragment. To the
southwest was more clear glass along with purple, amber, aqua and blue glass and additional whiteware.
There is no record of shovel tests at this site.
Located on the Brown-Boultinghouse tract, the structure is probably present on the 1890s-era map as
well. The site has been severely disturbed by past clearing activities. It is considered to be fully
documented and no avoidance or additional investigations are considered to be necessary.

91

41BT322 â Historic Component
This is a historic activity area that is probably the location of the original Henry Thomas Lodge (Figure
36). It also has a prehistoric component that may include a series of small hearths. As presently defined
the site is approximately 150 m on a northwest/southeast line and 100 m southwest to northeast. It is
upon the Sycamore Sand formation within Brackett soils. The site is bounded to the north, west and
south by small, interconnected drainage systems. A spring vent is present within the creek to the south, in
the vicinity of sites 41TV1850 and 41TV1851. Vegetation consists of typical upland vegetation, although
the interior of the site has been cleared in the past.
The historic component consists of at least three distinct sets of apparent limestone accumulations.
Farthest to the north, along the edge of a small gully, is a fairly dense pile of fire-cracked limestone,
apparently associated with a cast iron stove fragment. No other nearby artifacts were seen nor were any
encountered in a nearby shovel test. This feature marks the edge of the site to the northwest. About 40 m
to the southwest is what appears to represent a definitive foundation. It is composed of limestone blocks
and had associated metal fasteners, a possible handrail, and nearby broken flat glass.

Figure 35. Cistern at 41BT201, prior to removal.

A final rock alignment is within fairly dense cedar near the southern edge of the site. A two-track road
currently runs just to the south of this feature, and an apparent road trace seems to lead to it. It consists of
about 15 limestone blocks forming an open rectangle three to ten feet on a side. A nearby shovel test
recovered a single cut nail. Within the nearby road trace was also seen additional cut nails, âblackâ glass,

92

a cast iron stove fragment and a piece of blue featheredge ceramic. This southern portion of the site
appears to contain the oldest historic materials, as within the apparent site center was assorted metal and
glass, punch top cans, wire nails, other cast iron stove parts, flat glass, a mustard bottle, corrugated sheet
metal, some brick fragments, a paint can as well as whiteware.
Thirteen shovel tests have been excavated within the site, including near all identified features. Soils are
shallow to very shallow. Artifact recovery was minimal, but mostly consisted of a few pieces of lithic
debitage. A possible âthumbnailâ scraper was recovered from one test. This artifact, along with a metal
Wm. Rogers fiddle spoon, dated to between 1841 and 1939, were collected from the site.
The siteâs location corresponds to the location of the Spanish Oak Church as depicted on the 1906
topographic map of the area (see Figure 26). While other evidence does not support a church here, it is
almost certainly the location of the original Henry Thomas Lodge, established in 1865 and later moved to
Smithwick. The area was subsequently known as the location of the Spanish Oak School, and so was
probably also a church. The site location is at an elevation above that mapped during the 1936 Marshall
Ford mapping project. The historic component therefore dates between 1865 and at least into the early
part of the twentieth century, when the school was reportedly moved elsewhere. Artifacts indicate site
use into the middle part of the twentieth century, although no records of domestic use have surfaced.
While the historic component appears to have low archaeological potential, its apparent use as a
community gathering place since at least the middle 1860s allows greater interpretive and research
potential than the remainder of the historic sites at Turkey Bend. Ground disturbance should be avoided
until the site is more clearly understood and at minimum, more accurately mapped.

41BT323
This site consists of a cistern (now removed), some scattered foundation stones and a small amount of
trash, including a few tires. It is located on the west side of the primary gravel road leading down to the
shoreline on the western half of Turkey Bend. The site is about 100 feet in diameter. It is on a loamy
upland comprised of Ekrant (Tarrant) soils over the Sycamore Sand formation. Minor drainages are
found to the west and east. Vegetation consists mostly of grasses and mesquite trees. Oak trees are found
outside the site area.
The site is not associated with named structures on the 1936 map, and does not appear on the 1932
Spicewood map. It does appear as an unnamed structure on the 1936 map, however, depicted as an
outbuilding encompassed by the same fence that appears to define the Phillips' (41BT195) holdings. Few
artifacts were found directly associated with the cistern feature, although a relatively dense ceramic, glass
and metal scatter was within the nearby road. A single shovel test near the cistern found a single piece of
chert debitage. In general, the directly associated artifact scatter does not support domestic use of the site,
although the overall interpretation is inconclusive.
Despite the fact that the structure is not shown on the earlier of the two maps does not necessarily mean
the site was never occupied. Regardless, as of 1936 it seems to have been used as an outbuilding that
created a water catchment for a cistern adjacent to upland pasture. In two places the stream to the west
was crossed by either a series of limestone blocks, in one case, and a bit of mortared bricks in another. A
brush clearing project about the same time inadvertently redistributed some of the foundation blocks.
In 2011 the cistern was one of those removed by backhoe from Turkey Bend. The cistern was funnelshaped (Hixson 2012) and of partial masonry construction, with only the upper neck and collar lined with
stone. The portion of the cistern excavated into the gravelly clay subsoil was simply surfaced with
cement and lime mortar.
The site is considered to be fully documented and to lack significant research or interpretive potential.
Despite not having a clear ownership sequence, the site clearly falls within the general Turkey Bend
ownership sequence and by 1936 was apparently part of the Phillips property and was most likely used as
an auxiliary water source for livestock, probably primarily goats. No avoidance or additional
investigations are considered necessary.

41BT324 (Historic Component)
Site 41BT324 is a historic trash scatter/activity area located in the vicinity of historic sites 41BT201 and
41BT323. It is located across the head of a drainage system and a large stock tank (seen on the 1936
map) took advantage of the drainage (Figure 37). A possible root cellar was recorded originally but not
relocated on subsequent visits, and may have been a tree fall or other similar event, although an apparent
backdirt pile continues to suggest otherwise. Historic materials were concentrated along a fenceline (now
destroyed by clearing) and included numerous bottles and jars, especially of condiments, as well as heavy
glass, crockery fragments, whiteware and auto or truck parts such as wheels and rims, a radio, exhaust
94

pipes, a u-joint and a differential gear. Within the exiting dirt road a lid from a childâs ceramic tea set, a
large crockery lid handle, and a thick piece of glass were collected.
The site appears to represent a workshop area and except for a couple of bricks there was no evidence of a
structure ever having been present. The possible root cellar is enigmatic, and if it was such it may have
been communal. (Oral histories indicated that at least some root cellars were primarily storm shelters.)
The site seems to be more connected with the Boultinghouse interests than the Phillips, if fencelines on
the 1936 map are any indication. The materials all date to the 1930s or so. The site is considered to be
fully documented.

Figure 37. Stock tank remnants at 41BT324.

41BT328 (Historic Component)
Site 41BT328 is a prehistoric and historic component site located on a high upland lobe on the west side
of Turkey Bend. The site setting and prehistoric component are described in the prehistoric sites section.
The historic component consists of a fenceline, trash scatter and pile of limestone rock. The fence is
located at about the site center, on the high portion of the lobe. A split cedar palisade fence runs
northeast/southwest and meets a wire fence the runs southwest/northeast at a right angle creating a partial
enclosure to the northeast. Both fences are about 100 yards in length. Limestone rocks line at last a
portion of the palisade. The pile of limestone, probably stockpiled, is immediately south of the fence
intersection.
The artifacts include a can scatter with mostly punch-top cans and a few glass bottles. Other artifacts are
within the open right angle of the fence line where scattered cans, a metal bucket and a plowshare were
observed. No whiteware was documented. The artifacts seem to date to the mid-twentieth century. An
evaporated milk can dated to between 1931 and 1948, and a license plate dating to 1950 were also seen.
These artifacts all date to the post-dam era and indicate continuing land use, possibly sanctioned through
grazing leases, possibly unauthorized use of what would have been still a very remote property at that
time. No LCRA lease records were located that described any such use, however a conversation with a
descendent of a long-time landowner, Destry Kittman, indicated that family knowledge had his
grandfather as a lessee, probably around the time in question (Destry Kittman, personal communication,
August 2012)
95

The historic component of 41BT328 is considered to be fully documented and ineligible for formal
designation as an SAL. The prehistoric component, however, is not felt to be fully investigated so
additional assessment of the site is warranted should it become threatened.

41BT469
This is a recently discovered site located on a low river-side terrace at the extreme northwestern portion
of the LCRA property. This area is a low terrace and a tributary stream that is essentially landlocked and
only accessible by crossing private property, boat, or descending a long, steep rocky slope. About 100
feet in diameter, the site, which consists of an apparent chimney and house foundation, is on recent
alluvium along the Colorado River. Frequent inundation stifles all vegetation except for short grasses.
The primary feature consists of a limestone and rock rubble pavement, mostly flush with the ground
(Figure 38). The larger blocks are about 1.5 feet in diameter and perhaps 4-6 inches thick. The feature
aligns on a north/south axis, and the northern portion is mostly rubble. A fairly substantial artifact scatter
was located on the tributary terrace slope directly north of the feature. It consisted of purple, aqua, amber,
"black" and clear glass, whiteware, stoneware â including Albany-slipped and Bristol-glazed â cut nails, a
metal stove leg, a possible stove lid, horseshoe pieces, and from the single shovel test next to the feature,
a counterweight for a cotton scale, also known as a cotton pea (Figure 39).

Figure 38. Foundation at 41BT469.

96

The site is adjacent to a road seen on the modern USGS map and on the 1890s-era map, but curiously not
shown on the 1936 map. In the 1890s the road came down from the uplands of Turkey Bend, crossed the
small drainage north of the site then crossed the river somewhat further to the north. It is assumed this
road was re-established in recent times, and the modern topographic map shows it as a new development.
The roadcut in the cliffside, however, is well defined.
When LCRA acquired the property it was known as the Wilson tract. Because it was not part of the
research compiled previously additional archival information was gathered from LCRA archives. An
internal memo in 1939 noted a very poor record title, although the following information was extracted.
The first listed owner was R. W. Campbell and wife, who in 1889 transferred the property to G. W.
Duzan. C. B. Wilson and his wife Mabel came to own the property outright in 1928, and apparently had
managed it since about 1914 and used it for grazing, cultivation and the cutting of timber. A 1939
appraisal noted 25 pecan trees but said the cultivated land was idle. No structures were noted, and there
had been no change in value between 1933 and 1939. The Phillips, in 1926, transferred a lien held from
the Wilson's to a J. F. Montgomery. In 1932 the vendor's lien was paid in full by the Wilsons, who were
then living in Oklahoma.

Figure 39. Cotton pea from 41BT469.

The property was therefore used for various purposes, and cotton cultivation was clearly one of them
around the turn of the twentieth century, given the artifact assemblage. The 1906 map indicates a
structure nearby, although it seems to be higher on the landscape. Its location along the river crossing
was not necessarily significant, especially given that individual farmers often owned their own cotton
scales, according to informants on the TxArch-L listserv.
Site 41BT469 is therefore considered to be fully documented. No avoidance or additional investigations
are considered necessary.

97

41TV536
This site is a historic trash scatter and rock outline with a light prehistoric component located on the north
side of the main drainage system on the east side of the bend, and due north of the main road into the
park. The site is about 115 feet in diameter. It is on a gravelly terrace overlooking the drainage system to
the west and bordering the uplands to the east. It is upon the Cow Creek Hammet Shale formation in
shallow Tarrant soils. Vegetation is typical for the upland/upland margin setting.
When first recorded in 1981, it was described as a rock outline and nearby rock cairn. The site was
interpreted as a hunterâs camp, with the rock outline used to weight a tent. A later revisit in 1997 failed to
find the outline, but did relocate the cairn, described as a nondescript pile of rocks with cedar trees
growing out of it, as well as documenting a fairly recent fire ring. Some light dumping had occurred a bit
further to the east, where a bicycle frame, an evaporative cooler, two clear glass bottle fragments and a
condensed milk can were noted. A light scatter of lithic debitage was seen, although metate fragments
originally recorded were not relocated. Given the excellent visibility in shallow soils, no shovel tests
have been attempted.
Subsequent review and georeferencing of the 1906 topographic map shows a domestic structure very near
the plotted location of 41TV536. It would have been located at the end of a very short road spur that
crossed the drainage from the west. Apparently whatever structure was present had been removed by the
time of the 1936 reservoir-mapping project
This site, located on the Phillips Survey, has no additional archaeological potential, and the archival
research has largely been realized, as the house would have most likely have been lived in by members of
the Phillips family or tenants. No avoidance or additional investigations are considered necessary.

41TV1835 â The Burton House
This site is located on the center of the upland margin on the eastern side of the bend. It is within gravelly
Travis soils over the Sycamore Sand formation. The vegetation is typical of disturbed areas and is
dominated by thorny brush and cacti under juniper, mesquite and scattered oak trees. The site is about
220 feet in diameter.
The site consists of the highly disturbed remains of a homestead, consisting of various concentrated
scatters of brick and limestone blocks, various mounded areas, probably from bulldozing, a gate with
posts and the remains of a small corral. Artifacts include DâHanis brick fragments, whiteware, crockery,
cast iron stove pieces, various pieces of metal, both wire and cut nails, and metal barrel hoops. There is a
very light scatter of prehistoric lithic debris. Given the nature of the site no shovel tests have been
attempted.
The site was first recorded in 1997, and has been revisited on various occasions since. Two shovel tests
were placed within its boundaries when testing adjacent prehistoric site 41TV1881. Give the extreme
nature of previous disturbance systematic shovel testing was not considered to be necessary.
98

Subsequent historical research conducted by Dan Utley and others demonstrate that the site was occupied
by the Burton family by 1909, and became a tenant residence later in time. It is shown nearby on the
1932 Spicewood topographic map and is shown as the Burton place on the 1936 topographic map.
The site is considered to be fully documented and is not considered to be formally significant. There are
no recommendations for additional investigations or any type of avoidance.

41TV1857
This enigmatic historic site consists of two cisterns (since removed), a few foundation stones and a light
artifact scatter within an approximate 200 foot diameter area. It is located on the eastern portion of
Turkey Bend along the main road that leads down to the lakeshore and passes very near the private
inholding. The site is within the upland margin but the physical setting more closely resembles the
lowland floodplain, with the elevations changes more subdued and Pedernales loams instead of Tarrant or
Travis soils. It is, however, within the Sycamore Sand formation. Prior to clearing the site was covered
by very dense prickly pear, tassajillo, beebrush and mesquite thickets. A very large oak tree borders the
site along the road to the west. The tree has a horseshoe embedded in it at about chest height. This may
have been for game processing or may have been a surveyors mark. The 1936 map shows a benchmark at
about that location.
The two cisterns were only about 15 feet apart. They were both lined with masonry down to the base and
bottle shaped. Directly to the southeast of the two cisterns was an apparent foundation outline, heavily
disturbed, about 30 feet long on a side, where one shovel test with minor recovery was excavated.
Meanwhile, a possible chimney fall with a couple of nearby bricks was located about 70 feet northnortheast of the cisterns. Very few artifacts were noted and consisted of occasional pieces of whiteware
and glass, and assorted metal, including a barrel hoop.
While not named on the 1936 map, a structure is shown at that location, indicating it was uninhabited.
The site corresponds fairly well with a structure seen on the 1932 Spicewood quad. Although the site is
nearest the Hall place, located on the private inholding, it is within the Burton Tract, and the fencelines
shown on the 1936 map support its inclusion with the Burton holdings.
A discrepancy in the archival records, (see Historic Background section) indicates that there were two
separate structures probably described for the Burton property; one that was extremely dilapidated, and
another that had five rooms with adjoining shed and barns. The latter may well be the Burton place as
mapped (41TV1835) and the second the present site. Yet unresolved is how 41TV2397 (below) fits into
the picture. The obvious overall explanation is that the Burtons' had a number of improvements on their
property over time that included at minimum two residences and a barn complex.
Site 41TV1857 is considered to be fully documented archaeologically. The two cisterns have been
removed as safety and environmental hazards and archival evidence clearly links the site with the Burton
holdings. There are no recommendations for additional investigations or any type of avoidance.

99

41TV1883 â Historic component
This is a historic trash scatter with likely foundation stones along with a minor prehistoric lithic scatter
with mussel shell located on a high upland margin lobe overlooking the main drainage on the eastern
portion of the bend. It is within Tarrant soils over the Sycamore Sand formation. At the time of
recording in 1999 the site was covered with tassajillo, beebrush, mesquite and juniper. The site plotting
was based on the perceived contours and a pace back to the main road through dense vegetation assuming
a consistent compass bearing, and therefore may not be plotted accurately. The entirety of the site is
about 200 feet in diameter.
The historic component is located on the central, higher portion of the lobe and consists of a very few
pieces of whiteware, a crockery fragment, the remnants of a metal bucket and the rim of a glass. In
addition to the artifacts are several concentrations of tabular limestone, some in a linear arrangement, all
concentrated in the same general area. No shovel tests were attempted.
The site is very remote at present, and the 1936 map shows no structure at that location or any roads
nearby. The 1932 Spicewood map shows a road that goes to what is presumably the Burton place,
41TV1835, although the mapped structure is at the end of the road and is equidistant from 41TV1835 and
41TV1883. The site is clearly within the Burton family holdings and may represent another outbuilding,
a tenant house, or even the original place of settlement. It may also be from squatter activity as described
in the Historic Background section.
Despite the apparent ephemeral nature of the component, it is not considered to be fully documented at
this time. Although formal SAL eligibility is highly unlikely, the brief site visit over a decade ago should
be augmented with additional mapping including GPS to confirm the site's location as well as to reassess,
in particular, the presence of the apparent foundation stones. Limited shovel testing is also warranted.
The historic component is considered to be of unknown SAL eligibility.

41TV1961
This site is primarily a prehistoric site and is discussed in more detail in that section. The historic
component, however, is distinctive, so is briefly described here. The site is located on the extreme
northern end of the eastern portion of Turkey Bend. It is along the stream-fed drainage and is across from
a private residence just outside the park boundaries. Across the creeks slopes is a scatter of historic
material that included whiteware and purple glass, including panel glass. The trash seems relatively late,
as the documented purple bottle fragment had a screw-on neck and was embossed, as was another
medicine bottle (Chamber's Cough Syrup). While not associated with any obvious or even apparent
house remains, the site does correspond with a road crossing the creek that tied into the transportation
network within Turkey Bend, including the main road. The historic component of this site is considered
to be fully investigated.

This site is a livestock dipping vat, a below-ground cistern, and a few scattered limestone blocks. It is
about 200 feet in diameter and centered about 150 m south of the Burton residence (41TV1835). It is
within gravelly Travis soils originating over the Sycamore Sand formation on the edge of high terrace
overlooking Lake Travis to the southeast. Vegetation is typical of disturbed environments, with areas of
dense thorny brush and cacti in juniper and mesquite with scattered oak trees.
The cistern either was built without a collar or else the collar has been removed. The visible portion of
the cistern is about three feet in diameter, but is silted in to within about 4 feet of the ground surface. It is
lined with mortar or cement, so construction methods are unclear (Figure 40).
The site contains the only known dipping vat on Turkey Bend. As discussed in the Historic Background
section, it may have been used communally. While the cistern suggests a structure, there is little to no
evidence that one existed at that location. No structures are shown on the 1936 or 1906 maps.
While this site is not considered to be formally significant, it is not considered to be fully investigated.
More detailed mapping may allow structure locations to be determined, and shovel testing around the
cistern may help determine how it was supplied. Additional archival or other historical investigation may
help clarify the relation of the site to other known sites on the bend. Future projects including ground
disturbance should consider such investigations.

Figure 40. Cistern at 41TV2397.

The dipping vat is about 230 feet southwest of the cistern. It is quite well made and fairly elaborate, with
a 30-foot-long trough that is three feet wide, still holding water, with the entry ramp on the west end and
exit stairs on the east. At the exit is a large cement platform that clearly recycled water through a drain
101

pipe that fed a 2-foot-square collection box that in turn fed the trough (Figure 41). Remnant wooden
chute and corral pieces are at either end. There are no clear foundations or building locations, although a
seeming concentration of limestone blocks is located about 100 feet northwest of the cistern. Very few
artifacts were seen and these were limited to a metal washtub near the dipping vat, possible leather chaps
near the cistern, and a scatter of cans and bottles dating to the 1970s and 1980s. Given the nature of the
site, no shovel tests were excavated.

Historic Sites Summary
Historic sites are present that date to the earliest settlement at Turkey Bend, beginning around 1860 and
shortly thereafter when the Henry Thomas Lodge was founded, indicating Turkey Bend's importance as a
community at that time. Through the latter part of the 1800s some families consolidated their holdings
and began to intensify land use in the form raising of livestock and farming. While some older homes
apparently fell into disrepair and disappeared into the landscape, other house locations were improved and
possibly rebuilt, or in some cases established. The old Hall place, which was not sold to LCRA, remains
a livable structure apparently improved or rebuilt in the 1930s, and is visible from LCRA property. There
are other old structures that can be seen when approaching the park, especially the western portion.
Much of the community that made up Turkey Bend has disappeared, but physical aspects of it remain,
both within and outside the park, where additional research may prove fruitful. Within Turkey Bend the
research value is largely exhausted. Site 41BT201 has some interpretive value, and sites 41TV2397 and
41BT322 may be more fully interpreted with additional ground investigations. The remainder is
considered to be fully investigated.

PREHISTORIC SITE DESCRIPTIONS

The following section presents detailed site descriptions for 30 sites with prehistoric components that are
either considered eligible or potentially eligible for formal SAL status or for which a more detailed
description was considered to be useful in order to place nearby sites into context. Following this section
is one that presents summary data for sites that are not individually significant nor add information useful
for a specifically-focused understanding of nearby sites.
Many of the prehistoric sites have a distinctive type of artifact which is referred to here as a "bitted
chopper" (Figure 78 a). These are minimally modified cobbles with a typical crude butted chopper
appearance, except that the distal portion has been carefully isolated and then thinned, sometimes
unifacially, to create a bit at the working end. These have been primarily found in upland settings along
high ridgelines and lobes, and in at least one case as an isolated occurrence. The authors are not aware of
these types of artifacts described elsewhere, except perhaps in the site form for 41GL45, recorded by
Malcom Johnson in 1975. Johnson refers to an artifact he calls a "pointed chopper" and states that they
turn up "in numbers" at nearby sites that had not yet been recorded. At Turkey Bend, these tools are
considered to be an extractive tool for upland resources that require forceful processing or removal
techniques, perhaps a root or tuber. One such artifact was collected from a semi-buried context and the
bit left unwashed. Further examination of these tools may provide additional insight into food
procurement strategies.

41BT191
Site 41BT191 is a mixed-use site about 50 m diameter in size located in the southwestern side of the bend
on the high terrace overlooking Lake Travis to the west. It is on a lobe between two minor tributaries to
the Colorado River over the Sycamore Sand formation within Tarrant soils. Vegetation is consistent with
the setting.
The site was among those first recorded in 1981 by Prewitt and Associates and described as a lithic scatter
with impact minimization recommended. The PAI site is plotted about 300 m northwest of the present
location. Field notes from an LCRA field visit in 1998 saw no evidence of a site at the then-plotted
location of the site, but did locate a site largely matching the description of the site and a revisit form with
the adjusted UTM coordinates was submitted to TARL in 2003, which subsequently revised the location.
As presently described the site is located on a relatively broad, southwest trending lobe flanked by two
drainages to the north and the south. Vegetation consists of fairly open grassland with established juniper
and mesquite and some oak trees around the perimeter. Observed cultural material consisted of some 1015 pieces of debitage including one large primary flake, the rest being secondary and tertiary flakes.
Possible burned sandstone, possible groundstone and a single piece of mussel shell were also observed. It
was noted that there may be deep soils in portions of the site, although no shovel tests were excavated.

103

Although the site is unlikely to be eligible for SAL status, it has not been revisited since 1998. Prior to
any ground disturbing activities the site should be reassessed.

41BT192
This is a mixed-use site located in the southwestern part of the park in an upland area overlooking the
Colorado River channel. The underlying geology consists of Sycamore Sand over which has developed
Eckrant soils. The site is situated on a south-southwest trending lobe of land between dissected
intermittent drainages. Vegetation appears to be open woodland verging on savanna, with mesquite and
juniper as dominant tree species.
The site was first recorded in 1981 by Prewitt and Associates for an LCRA brush control project. Only a
depleted core and a few flakes were seen on the surface. Although the site was assessed as having limited
information yield, hand clearing was recommended to avoid disturbing the deposits. Also, testing was
recommended to determine its National Register eligibility. The site was revisited in 1998 by an LCRA
archeologist who found considerably more artifacts, including a sandstone metate (Figure 42), a thick
biface, five cores, several tested cobbles, and (mostly cortical) debitage. Testing was recommended if the
site were to be threatened.
This site has not been revisited since 1998. It is probable that a more intensive survey with shovel testing
will determine the regulatory status of this site. The type of artifacts (mainly lithics) and thin upland soils
would suggest that the research potential for this site is low. Regardless, prior to any ground disturbing
activities the site should be reassessed.

41BT194
Site 41BT194 is described as an open camp located on a high terrace lobe formed by a ridgeline
overlooking Lake Travis on the southwest side of the bend. It is over the Sycamore Sand formation in
Tarrant soils. It is in relatively open woods with a grass and forb cover under a canopy of juniper and
mesquite along with a few isolated oak trees.
First recorded in PAI in 1981, it was described as "fairly heavy" lithic scatter from which a basallythinned Late Archaic projectile point was documented. An LCRA revisit in 1998 found about 20 pieces
of debitage, mostly interior, other burned flakes, an interesting early-stage biface made on a thin piece of
trapezoidal tabular chert with alternately beveled edges (but not a beveled knife), as well as one sandstone
and three granite manos, a possible sandstone metate fragment, and burned sandstone. The site had been
recently impacted by looting activities, but damage was minor (Figure 43). At least one subsequent
reconnaissance monitoring visit did not indicate the site was being severely impacted, however no shovel
tests have been excavated.

104

Figure 42. Metate at 41BT192.

There was also a minor historic trash scatter consisting of two 48-ounce juice cans, a piece of whiteware,
and a piece of clear and piece of brown glass. A utility pole indicates there was once a power supply to
the area but there is no evidence, either archaeologically or in archives, of a structure ever having been
present.
Although there are no identified food remains (mussel shell, bone) the site is considered to be an open
camp based on the presence of groundstone and burned rock. While not likely to be formally eligible for
SAL status, the site is not considered to be fully investigated. Prior to any ground disturbing activities the
site should be reassessed.
41BT322 â Prehistoric component
The setting of 41BT322, described in the Historic Sites section, lends itself well to a prehistoric campsite.
The nearby spring and cross drainages that resulted in burned rock midden sites 41TV1850 and
41TV1851, located just downstream, would have created conditions favorable for camping activities.
The prehistoric component consists of a few scattered flakes, the medial section of an untyped dart point,
a âchopper,â (possibly a bitted biface), and apparent burned limestone, some possibly representing
scattered hearths. A small thumbnail scraper was recovered from a shovel test (Figure 77 c, d). The
possible hearths were located near the southern part of the site, adjacent to a two-track road.
Although a number of shovel tests found little in the way of buried cultural materials, the site's location
and the presence of apparent features suggest that additional investigations are warranted should the site
become threatened. The prehistoric component of the site is considered to have unknown SAL eligibility.

41BT325
Site 41BT325 is a mixed-use site located in an upland setting across a high lobe on the west side of
Turkey Bend. It is over the Cow Creek Limestone/Hammett Shale formation in Tarrant soils. Vegetation
is primarily juniper and mesquite. About 200 m in diameter, it was documented with numerous flakes,
three or four manos, a granite metate fragment, a few cores, a so-called chopper core, and scattered,
probable burned rock. Given past clearing activities, the burned rock was impossible to assign to
prehistoric activities.
While probably an upland campsite, there was not enough information available on the ground to
confidently describe it as such. Furthermore, the site was defined based on a series of map plots where
artifacts were located, rather than from observances of a site with numerous artifacts. The site is therefore
considered to not be fully documented. Prior to any ground disturbing activities the site should be
reassessed.

41BT328
Site 41BT328 is a lithic scatter with historic ranching component (discussed in the historic section) that is
located in Tarrant soils over the Sycamore Sand formation on a broad, upland southeast-trending lobe on
the west side of Turkey Bend. Located immediately east of 41BT325, it is covered with areas of dense
juniper interspersed with open grassy areas dominated by both oak and mesquite trees.
106

The prehistoric component of the site consists of widely scattered lithic materials which are most visible
along the exposed southern edges of the lobe, although they are also present in lower quantities, or as
isolates, elsewhere. Observed materials included multidirectional cores, ealry-stage bifaces, and
numerous pieces of debitage, mostly secondary and tertiary. A thin biface was collected (Figure 76 a).
No quantities of naturally-occurring chert were observed, indicating that these materials were transported
to the landform. Also present at the site was a "bitted chopper" which at the time of site recording in
1998 was when these tools were recognized as distinct artifacts apparently associated with upland
resource extraction.
While it is highly unlikely that the prehistoric component of this site would be eligible for formal SAL
status, the original site form indicates the potential for soil development in the higher portions of the site,
particularly around the historic feature where two negative shovel probes were excavated. The site is
therefore considered to not be fully documented so prior to any ground disturbing activities it should be
reassessed.

41BT332
Site 41BT332 is an open camp near a series of low rockshelters located on the steep western side of
Turkey Bend immediately below the high terrace edge (Figure 44). It is within the Sycamore Sand
formation and soils are extrapolated as being of the Pedernales series but may be partially, at least, of the
Tarrant series. The site is at a juncture of limestone, sandstone and extensive conglomerate formations
that become more pronounced to the north. A short drainage borders the site to the north, and slopes are
nearly vertical to the east. Field notes indicate a "cave" nearby that would require a rope to visit. Thick
juniper and oak trees are along the slopes, while the intermittently inundated shoreline portion of the site
is relatively open with grasses and forbs.
Observed materials consisted of a very light scatter of flakes, perhaps six in total, as well as possible and
probably groundstone in the form of a limestone metate, a sandstone metate, apparent mano fragments
and probable scattered burned rock. The site was recorded above an elevation of 675 ft msl, and mention
was made of a potential high probability lobe at lower elevations depicted on the 1936 topographic map.
A subsequent reconnaissance survey at lower lake elevations indicates this entire section of shoreline is
severely deflated and that the site does not appreciably extend westward. The rockshelters to the east
have likewise been informally revisited, but have not been tested.
The site, therefore, while probably not eligible for SAL status, remains incompletely investigated,
especially along the drip lines of the low shelters. While any development is extremely unlikely here, the
site remains not fully investigated. Additional investigations and clearer documentation are needed to
make a final assessment of the site. Until then it should be considered potentially significant.

107

Figure 44. One of low rockshelters at 41BT332.

41BT333
Site 41BT333 is an open camp with two small rockshelters, one with definite cultural material, located on
the steep river edge immediately below the high terrace edge on the west side of Turkey Bend. It is
directly across (northwest of) the small drainage from 41BT332 and likewise is within the Sycamore Sand
formation. Soils are extrapolated as being of the Pedernales series but may be partially, at least, of the
Tarrant series. Vegetation is sparse on the intermittently exposed shoreline and more established with
oak, juniper, and mesquite on higher slopes and benches. The general setting is on the toe of the steep
south-trending lobe, and conglomerate deposits composed of cemented quartzite, chert and sandstone.
The conglomerate bench has collapsed in two places leaving fairly large voids that may have been used
prehistorically for shelter.
The two shelters are about 15 m apart and both face south. Shelter 1 is approximately at the site's center
and consists of a shallow overhang about 1 m tall, 3 m wide and 2 m deep. Shelter 2 is further toward the
drainage head and is more pronounced â about 0.75 m tall, 2 m wide and 5 m deep (Figure 45). While no
cultural materials were noted with Shelter 1, Shelter 2 contained a few flakes and non-recent mussel shell
within the silty matrix of the shelter floor and a soil bench in front of the shelter had numerous, nonrecent mussel shell within the matrix.

108

Figure 45. Shelter 2 at 41BT333.

Immediately downslope and south of Shelter 2, at an elevation of about 690 ft msl, was a group of three
distinct, relatively small, midden deposits (Figure 46). They all contained fire-cracked sandstone and
limestone as well as commonly occurring mussel shell and relatively numerous flakes, seen especially
within the eroded cuts produced by lake fluctuation. Probable groundstone was also present as well as a
few chert cores.
The site has been informally revisited since its first recording in 1998 but no significant changes in site
condition have been documented. The site is considered to be potentially eligible for formal listing as an
SAL. Development of this portion of the tract is highly unlikely, so the site should be monitored, tested,
and reevaluated as circumstances allow.

41BT337
This is a prehistoric campsite eroding from the full pool shoreline, between about 675-685 ft msl, on the
southwest edge of Turkey Bend. Nearly all the artifacts were observed along a 130 m stretch of the shore
where the upper one meter of soil has washed away, as shown by the height of the cutbank along the
northeast side of site. This cutbank is eroding laterally in a northeasterly direction, leaving artifacts
redeposited on the near-shore lake bed over an area of 7,580 sq m. At the present time, because of the
cutbank, the area has the appearance of a river terrace (Figure 47, Figure 48). However, prior to the lake
impoundment, the site area was probably a low slope or lobe descending gradually to the southwest
toward the river channel. A small drainage runs southwestwards to the river along the west side and
forms an inlet when the lake is near full pool.

109

Figure 46. Midden deposits below collapsed conglomerate at 41BT333.

The underlying bedrock rock is composed of reddish pebbly sand, silt, and clay belonging to the
Sycamore Sand formation. Deep, sandy soils mapped as the Pedernales series have developed on this
parent material, supporting an open woods of Huisache on intact areas inland from the cutbank. The
eroded areas support forbs and grasses if uncovered by the lake for sufficient lengths of time. Holocene
alluvium is found south of the site.
The only feature known from this site is a cluster of about 20 cobble-sized burned rocks lying at the base
of the cutbank on the east side of the site. Presumably these rocks represent a once-buried hearth that has
eroded from the cutbank. When the site was first recorded, one rock from this feature was still embedded
in the cutbank one meter below the surface, which would place it very close to bottom of the cut. The
rock cluster contained an assortment of rock types, including quartz, chert, sandstone, and possibly
granite. The artifact inventory includes about 30 pieces of debitage, four or five cores, one scraper, one
biface fragment, and two possible mano fragments. All are presumed to have once been incorporated in
the sandy soil before the shoreline receded to the northeast.
The site was first recorded in 1998 by an LCRA archeologist doing cultural resource inventory survey in
the park. The site was revisited a year later during a Llano Uplift Archeological Society field trip led by
the same LCRA archeologist, at which time a shovel test was dug in the intact area about 10 meters east
of the burned rock cluster. No artifacts were recovered from this test except for a modern bottle glass
fragment between 20 and 40 cm below surface. The test encountered sandy loam from the surface down
to the bottom at 90 cm, the sand fraction increasing with depth. It is assumed that this soil belongs to the
Pedernales series, although no clay loam typical of the B horizon of this soil type was recorded for the
test.

110

Figure 47. Cutbank at 41BT337 in 1998, looking north.

The research potential of this site remains undetermined. All artifacts were found on eroded surfaces and
there is still uncertainty if any cultural deposits are present in the intact soil northeast of the cutbank.
Further shovel testing is recommended in this area if threatened by construction.

41BT353
This is a prehistoric lithic scatter within a thin gravel lens exposed in the cutbank of a small drainage at
the full pool shoreline of the lake. The artifact-bearing gravels run for distance of about 160 meters
north-northeast to south-southwest following the west side of the drainage. Probably most of the gravel
lens lies at an elevation slightly above the full pool lake level except at the extreme south end where it
might dip slightly below.
The site lies within an extensive area of Holocene alluvium that formed through point-bar accretion. The
terrace area at the north end of the site lies above the full pool and the soil there has been mapped as
Pedernales fine sandy loam. These soils support a dense canopy of Huisache trees. The terrace below the
full pool is mostly open and covered by thick grass and forbs. The stream cut runs in a nearly straight
line, which suggests that it has been artificially modified. The 1936 map shows this drainage running
parallel to a fenceline 200 feet to the east. To the west, the same map shows a cultivated field. At the
present time, the drainage resembles a gully about 10 to 20 meters wide where it traverses the site area

111

Figure 48. Cutbank at 41BT337 in 2011, looking south, note slumping due to inundation.

and up to two meters deep. Upstream, the drainage cut becomes narrower and deeper. When the lake is
at full pool, the drainage becomes a long narrow inlet.
Artifacts consist of a low-density scatter of chert debitage within a thin stratum of gravels buried
approximately 170 cm below the surface. A mano was seen nearby on the terrace unassociated with the
gravel lens.
The site was recorded during a 1999 Llano Uplift Archeological Society field trip led by an LCRA
archeologist. A detail map drawing was made of the site but no shovel testing was done. The fact that the
artifacts are mixed with gravels suggest that they have been redeposited by some major flood event in the
past. There is still the possibility these artifacts are the residue of human activity that took place at this
location after the gravels were deposited. Because of this possibility, subsurface testing is recommended
should the site be threatened by construction. Considering the depth of the possible buried component,
backhoe trenching would be necessary.

112

Figure 49. Site 41BT353, looking generally north.

41BT391
This prehistoric site is situated on a narrow, 100-meter wide terrace bench located on an otherwise steep
slope that descends from the upland margins to the east bank of the Colorado River channel. The site is
located about 40 feet above the original river channel edge on the north side of a small unnamed tributary
drainage. Bedrock geology consists of the Sycamore Sand, and the topsoil is a brown silty clay loam that
reaches an average depth of 23 cm. It is underlain by a dark brown silty loam that extends down to at
least 70 cm below ground surface as indicated by a 50-cm-wide soil profile that was cleared on a cutbank
exposure. Vegetation at the site consists of cedar and mesquite trees and various grasses.
The site is located at about 680 feet ft msl and thus is shallowly inundated by the normal Lake Travis
conservation pool (Figure 50). The archaeological materials are exposed for a length of about 24 meters
(79 feet) on a vertical, 40-to-60-cm high cutbank that has formed due wave action on the fluctuating
shoreline of the lake. Prehistoric materials are readily visible in the deeper, dark-colored soil zone. These
artifacts include burned rocks, chert chipping debris, ground stone fragments and large numbers of mussel
shell fragments (Figure 51). Although the site was not shovel tested, it does not appear that any
prehistoric artifacts are present in the lighter colored, 20 to 25 cm thick lighter soil zone that lies at the top
of the soil profile. Numerous artifacts are present, however, on the surface of the deflated and eroded
slope that extends downslope southwestward toward the edge of the terrace bench.

113

Figure 50. Looking east from area normally submerged toward 41BT391.

The site was originally recorded by Bob Wishoff in November 2005 when the lake level stood at about
665 ft ft msl. He described the site as an open campsite with a shell midden deposit. He recovered a
Pedernales point, a medial section of a biface (Figure 76 g), and the distal end of a second biface (Figure
76 f) from the surface of the eroded slope. He also states on the original site form that he had been told
that Scallorn and Perdiz arrowpoints had previously been found by collectors at this site. He estimated
that the site could have deposits of 1 meter thickness and that the site could have a minimum width of 70
meters. However, areas downslope from the cutbank were much more fully exposed down to 634 ft ft
msl as at the time of the LCRA Cultural Resource staffâs visit in March 2012. The downslope areas have
little potential for buried deposits as they appeared to be mostly deflated and eroded down to limestone
bedrock.

Figure 51. Detail of mussel shell and rock lens at 41BT391.

114

The intact prehistoric materials in the cutbank at 41BT391 probably represent the back edge of what was
once a much larger site that originally extended westward toward the terrace edge overlooking the river
channel. LCRA staff estimates that from the cutbank exposure, intact materials may extend
northwestward into the terrace bank for a distance of only about 10 meters before terminating at the base
of the steep slope. Despite the fact that much of the site appears to have been lost to fluctuating lake
levels, the remaining area is of interest and deserves further investigation due to the buried nature of
cultural deposits and the fact that multiple components are probably present.

41BT470
This is a prehistoric campsite containing a small burned rock midden and a sparse lithic scatter. It is
located in the same inlet as several other small prehistoric campsites (41BT471-473) recorded by LCRA
archeologists during a 2012 inventory reconnaissance. Most of the midden appears to lie outside LCRA
property.
The site is situated on the surface of a low alluvial terrace on the north side of intermittent drainage that
runs in a westerly direction toward the Colorado River channel. Being below the full pool of the lake,
the site area has not been mapped for soil type, but is probably the Pedernales series. The underlying
bedrock is a conglomerate belonging to the Sycamore Sand formation. These conglomerates outcrop
along the lower slopes of the inlet. Within the site area, the terrace has eroded into two lobes projecting
southwards toward the drainage. The burned rock midden is on the larger, western lobe and a light lithic
scatter is present on the eastern lobe. Three cypress stumps on the western lobe show that about a foot of
soil has eroded away.
The burned rock midden is a circular burned rock concentration estimated to be about 15 meters across.
The rock concentration is dense and composed mostly of sandstone. Considering the size and density of
the midden, only a few artifacts were observed. The only artifact seen on the midden was a core, while
two flakes were observed on the smaller lobe to the east. No mussel shell was reported.
Of the four prehistoric sites recorded in this inlet, 41BT470 is the only one with a burned rock midden. It
is unusual, too, in that it does not have a lot a lithics and apparently no mussel shell or groundstone. The
midden appears undisturbed and probably has research value. The main drawback is that only a small
percentage of this feature is on LCRA land, and that extra-midden cultural material appears sparse.
Future investigations would need to test for buried deposits in the terrace.

41BT471
This small prehistoric campsite is located near the end of the narrow inlet on the northwest side of Turkey
Bend (Figure 53). It occupies a small lobe projecting northwards from the base of a steep ridge toward
an intermittent creek. The lobe is small, restricting the size of the site to less than 80 sq m, but it contains
dense camping debris. Another smaller lobe 90 meters to west is occupied by another prehistoric
115

campsite site, 41BT473, with similarly dense deposits. To the north across the creek lies 41BT472, a
prehistoric campsite buried in the upper deposits of a terrace remnant, and 100 meters to west of this site
lies 41BT470, a prehistoric campsite with a burned rock midden.

Figure 52. Midden deposits at 41BT470. Looking east along drainage toward 41BT471-473.

Figure 53. Site 4BT471, looking west toward river.
116

Site 41BT471 is underlain by conglomerate rocks of the Sycamore Sand formation. The lobe appears to
be composed of alluvium, or perhaps colluvium, mixed with talus material from the ridge. The inlet had
been above the water for some time when the site was recorded in early 2012 by LCRA archeologists and
the bed of the inlet was then covered by grasses and forbs. Vegetation was sparse on the lobe, however,
allowing for good visibility. The ridge above is heavily wooded with live oak dominating.
The surface of the lobe is covered with burned rocks, debitage, mussel shells, and groundstone, all mixed
with numerous unburned rocks originating from the talus slope. Eroding from the lobeâs north slope is a
horizontal line of rocks 70 cm in length that probably represents the edge of a buried hearth. Diagnostic
artifacts collected from the surface include an Ensor point and a corner-tang drill (Figure 75 g, i). A
complete metate was also present.
This site is potentially important because it might contain one or more buried hearths. The size of the site
and the fact that both diagnostic artifacts are contemporaneous (Late Archaic II) suggests a narrow time
frame, adding to its research potential. Because the site lies below the full pool of the lake, construction
projects are unlikely to affect it. However, if the site should be threatened, testing would be needed to
determine if intact features with research potential are present.

41BT472
This is a prehistoric site, possibly a campsite, located on the northwest side of Turkey Bend in the same
inlet as 41BT471 (Figure 54). Apparently most of the site area lies outside the park â the northern
property boundary runs through the southern part of the site as determined by GPS. An intermittent
barbed wire fence follows the southern edge of the site area but this probably does not represent the true
property line, which should run some distance â several meters or more â to the north. Possibly as much
as 400 sq m of the site is located on LCRA property. The site lies on the north side of the small drainage
across from 41BT471 a short distance downstream from where two side branches enter the main drainage.
The immediate area is underlain by conglomerates belonging to the Sycamore Sand formation. Within
the inlet, these conglomerates are capped in places by Holocene alluvium probably derived from the
Colorado River. The site is incorporated into the upper sediments of one of these alluvial formations, a
terrace remnant on the northeast portion of the inlet. This terrace rises well above the alluvial lobes
where the other archeological sites in the inlet are situated. The upper surface of this terrace probably lies
immediately above full pool elevation of the lake, allowing a thick carpet of grass and huisache trees to
grow. The southern edge of the site has eroded into a steep cutbank 8 to 10 feet in high.
All the artifacts were observed embedded in the cutbank about 40 cm below the terrace surface. These
include two flakes and two mussel shell valves. The small amount of cultural material could mean that
most of the site has eroded away, that the site contains a sparse amount of cultural material, or that more
substantial cultural deposits lie buried in the terrace to the north. Also, deep components might be present
but obscured by sediment that has accumulated at the base of the cutbank. The site was recorded during a
2012 reconnaissance-level investigation of this part of Turkey Bend and its SAL eligibility remains

117

unknown. If the site is threatened by construction, further investigation is needed probably requiring test
excavations to reach the deeper deposits.

Figure 54. 41BT472, looking northeast.

41BT473
This site is in the same general location and setting as 41BT471. It was located while walking back on
the south side of the inlet where sites 41BT470-41BT473 are located. The site is on a small, deflated lobe
and is only about 10 m in diameter. It is highly eroded and deflated, exposing moderate amounts of
burned limestone and sandstone, debitage, and mussel shell (Figure 55). A highly polished pebble
(Figure 77 e) and burned Ensor-like point (Figure 75 f) were collected.
Unlike 41BT471 and 41BT472, there is little reason to avoid this site. It is useful for helping to
demonstrate land use along this small drainage, but is not considered to be eligible for formal SAL status,
and there is no need to avoid it or conduct additional investigations.

41BT474
This is a small prehistoric campsite located on the terrace slope of the Colorado River at the mouth of a
shallow cove on the west side of Turkey Bend. It lies below the full pool level of Lake Travis and only
begins to be exposed when the lake drops below 665 feet. Rocky ridges rise steeply on the north, east,
and south sides of the cove. A small dry drainage enters the cove from the northeast, incising a narrow
channel in the bedrock.

118

The immediate area is underlain by conglomerates of the Sycamore Sand formation. This bedrock is
capped by 15 to 20 feet of alluvial sand and silt derived from the Colorado River, which slopes steeply
down toward the river channel to the west. This surface is actively eroding with sloughing and slumping
of the sediments. On more stable surfaces, grasses and forbs have a chance to grow.

Figure 55. Site 41BT473, looking west toward river.

A moderate amount of burned rocks, a few flakes, and one complete sandstone metate were observed on
the terrace slope within about a 30-meter area. The amount of exposed burned rocks would represent a
single, small-sized hearth. When the site was recorded, all this material had already eroded from (or
slumped with) the terrace sediments and been redeposited downslope. Although its exact point of origin
within the terrace is unknown, this material hasnât moved far and probably eroded from sediments near
the 665-foot contour.
Shovel testing would be needed to determine if cultural material is still present within the terrace deposits.
The site should be periodically monitored to see if any hearths or other features are eroding from the
deposits.

41TV537
This is a prehistoric campsite with a small burned rock midden or possible large hearth located on the
north edge of the park. The midden and associated light scatter of artifacts are spread across low benches
or terraces at the upper end of a drainage system immediately upstream from the junction of two streams.
The surface geology under most of the site area has been mapped as Cow Creek Limestone and Hammett
Shale, undivided. Tarrant soils have developed on this formation. The area is covered by dense oakjuniper woodland with some open patches of grasses and mesquite. A narrow corridor has been cleared
along the parkâs boundary fence for a fire break and truck path (Figure 58). The site probably extends to
the east outside the park where the ground begins to level off. This level area is underlain by the
Sycamore Sand formation, on which Volente silty clay loam has formed.
120

Figure 58. Site 41TV537, east edge. Burned rock midden is in woods to left. Looking North.

The site was originally recorded by Lone Star Archeological Services in 1981 for an LCRA cultural
property assessment. They noted the presence of a burned rock midden covering a 3-x-4-meter area. No
other cultural material was seen. The surrounding soils â or possibly the midden â were described as a
superficial exposure with little or depth. Testing of the midden was recommended if threatened. A 1997
revisit by an LCRA archeologist failed to relocate the midden with certainty although some possible
burned rocks were noted. Several cores, a metate fragment, and single flake were seen on the surface.
The site was revisited again in 2009 by LCRAâs Cultural Resources staff. This time, the midden was
relocated and found to be as described by Briggs, although may have been more scattered. In its present
condition, it is about 6 m x 4 m oriented down slope. One well-made mano was found downslope and
just to the west of the midden, and a possible limestone metate was seen nearby. Two shovel tests
encountered shallow deposits although the second test was terminated on an intact burned rock pavement.
This may be more an oven than a burned rock midden. The remainder of the site is a diffuse lithic scatter.
Because of the thin soil and sparse cultural deposits, most of the site area is probably not eligible for SAL
designation. The one feature, whether midden or oven bed, is potentially significant. For example, it may
contain food remains or provide other information on subsistence technology. If this feature is
threatened, testing of the feature is recommended in order to determine if its internal structure is
preserved or if organic remains are present.

121

41TV1850
Site 41TV1850 is one of a pair of burned rock middens (the other is 41TV1851, now destroyed) located
on the eastern half of Turkey Bend on the primary unnamed drainage located on that side. It is near the
junction of three branch drainages and an improved spring vent is immediately upstream. It is
approximately upon a Cow Creek/Hammett Shale and Sycamore Sand divide (perhaps explaining the
spring) in mapped Tarrant soils. The site abuts the creek at the base of an upland rise on a terrace about
20 m wide. Vegetation is mostly grass, although a single large oak tree grows out of the near center of
the midden.
The site was first recorded in 1998 while conducting a survey and was recognized by a series of looter
pits in the midden center and along the creek bank, which is about 1.5 m high in this area (Figure 59).
The midden is a classic mound of dense burned rock, organic and ashy soil, and few artifacts, and based
on cutbank observation is thicker than 50 cm. Mussel shell is present in consistent but not great
quantities. Only occasional flakes were seen, but the distal portion of a dart point was collected in 2009
(Figure 76 c). Another dart point tip found in the creek bed was photographed in 1998. Other tools
included a possible fragment of a sandstone metate and a possibly edge-modified secondary flake.

Figure 59. Looting in 1998 at 41TV1850.

Looting of the site mostly stopped after LCRA Cultural Resource Services personnel and LCRA rangers
left business cards and finally a letter at the looted areas. At some point persons unknown piled brush
along the creek bank, which may have been merely to slow erosion, or to help preserve and mask the
deposits. This site, as with 41TV1851, is very near the LCRA property line within the private inholding,
and a private road crosses through the area. There are no clear boundaries, and the owners of the
inholding were unaware that LCRA owned those pieces until relatively recently, according to LCRA Real
Estate personnel.
The site is particularly interesting when compared to 41TV1851, which is (was, see below) clearly a
multi-purpose camp with abundant tools and associated midden deposits. Site 41TV1850 has not been
tested, and the potential remains for there to be well-defined and preserved activity areas surrounding the
midden. The midden itself is still probably 90 percent intact and can almost certainly provide new
information of formation processes. The site is therefore considered to be eligible for SAL status. Given
122

its location along a private property boundary no development is anticipated. Regardless, the site should
be monitored, preserved and protected, with testing or mitigation if that becomes impossible.

41TV1851
Site 41TV1851 is (was) an open camp with dense occupational materials located immediately across and
just a bit downstream from site 41TV1850 along the primary side drainage of the eastern side of the bend.
About 30 m in diameter, it is upon the Sycamore Sand formation within Tarrant soils. While burned rock
midden 41TV1850 is immediately along the creek at an elevation of approximately 690 ft msl (within the
Lake Travis flood pool), site 41TV1851 is at the top of a steep rise at an elevation of approximately 710 ft
msl (an elevation rarely flooded by the lake). The site is within a relatively open grassy knoll surrounded
by clusters of juniper trees and scattered oak and mesquite. It is flanked by a minor stream drainage to
the north. The site was leveled in 2005 by equipment, apparently due to a misunderstanding with the
adjacent landowners as to where property boundaries were physically located, and is now considered
destroyed.
When first recorded in 1998, hundreds of flakes were seen, mostly interior and secondary, some quite
large, up to 10 cm diameter or more. Also noted were edge-modified flakes, an apparent perforator, and
core tools (Figure 60). A side scraper was collected (Figure 77 f). Several manos â including one of
quartzite â and metate fragments, mostly of sandstone, were present. The site also had sufficiently dense
fire-cracked rock, both sandstone and limestone, along with mussel and snail shell, to qualify as a burned
rock midden. Looting had been ongoing, with very old looter pits located on the northern edge of the site
and at least four pits around the remaining periphery of the site (Figure 61). These pits exposed dark
midden soil in places as well as dense burned rock and mussel shell. Ironically, in 2005, a stronglyworded wooden sign warning against looting had been placed at the base of the slope below the site near
a fresh pot hole and was found at the same time the site was discovered to have been destroyed.
Site 41TV1851 had the potential, along with 41TV1850, to explore differing dynamics in burned rock
midden formation. Site 41TV1851 was clearly an open camp where intensive food processing took place,
while 41TV1850 was a food processing locale where camping activities were limited. Both sites were
positioned to take advantage of the nearby spring. While no time-diagnostic artifacts were located at
either site, other than two Archaic (probably Late) projectile point tips at 41TV1850, it is quite likely that
the two sites were occupied at the same time, operating in tandem in support of a small group (assuming
41TV1851 represents the group size directly using the resources). The research potential at 41TV1851
has unfortunately been compromised to the point where it no longer can be considered eligible for formal
SAL status. At present any development is highly unlikely. A cursory reexamination, perhaps to try for
dateable charcoal recovery in order compare with 41TV1850, could be considered. Otherwise the site is
fully documented and no further work or avoidance is considered necessary.

123

Figure 61. Looting in 1998 at 41TV1851.

41TV1859
Site 41TV1859 is a small (about 10 m in diameter, as observed) open campsite located on the eastern
portion of Turkey Bend just above the active river channel at an elevation of approximately 667 ft msl. It
is normally submerged by Lake Travis and only becomes vegetated with grass during extended periods of

124

low water. While soils are not mapped, they are most likely of the Pedernales series forming in Holocene
alluvium.
The site consists of a single 1 m diameter hearth containing about 20 pieces of limestone, granite and
sandstone within a slightly larger debitage scatter. About 30 flakes, mostly secondary and tertiary, along
with an extensive mussel shell scatter, were present.
While the hearth feature had clearly been impacted by intermittent inundation processes, it was relatively
intact and is upon deposits of unknown depth. It very possibly represents a series of ephemeral camping
activities along the river bank where small-scale procurement or simply camping took place. Many such
sites will have been lost to flooding events, while others may still be present in aggrading surfaces. Site
41TV1859 is potentially eligible for formal SAL status. Such a recommendation would be contingent
upon evidence of organic preservation or additional vertical or horizontal deposits.

41TV1865
This prehistoric campsite is located along the high terrace edge on a prominent overlook lobe about 30
meters past the normal Lake Travis conservation pool. Surface geology consists of the Cow Creek
Limestone and Hammett Shale, undivided. The topsoil at this site is a shallow grayish-brown clay loam
that is generally less than 10 cm thick. In some areas, limestone bedrock or shale is exposed on ground
surface. Although much of the site surface is covered by grasses and thick stands of cedar trees,
some chert chipping debris, cores and tools are visible on ground surface in addition to burned rocks,
groundstone fragments and mussel shell. Ground surface visibility is best along the path of a dirt road
that curves around the lobe and in areas where limestone bedrock is exposed on and very near ground
surface. The surface scatter of artifacts along with the results of shovel testing suggests that the site covers
an area measuring 100 by 20 m.
At least three activity areas, two for food processing and one for tool manufacture, could be discerned.
Mussel shell was concentrated toward the tip of the lobe and appeared to be associated with a mano,
scattered burned rocks, a possible hearth, a metate fragment, a Marcos-type dart point, miscellaneous
chert interior chipping debris, and a chert core. Another area contained a few chert flakes with a denser
concentration of burned rocks and a metate fragment and mano. A third area contained an early stage
chert biface, a mid- to late-stage chert biface, as well as a few chert flakes and chunks. Two positive
shovel tests excavated within the surface scatter produced very small numbers of chert debitage (n= 3 and
5) in very shallow soil deposits ranging from 4 to 11 cm.
The survey level investigations indicate that features and discrete activity areas are present at this site.
The single diagnostic artifact found at the site dates to the Late Archaic II Period (Figure 75 e). Artifacts
and features found at the site suggest that the site functioned as a mixed use area in an upland setting
overlooking the Colorado River channel. Despite the limited finds in shovel tests and the shallow nature
of soil deposits, the site warrants further investigation to further explore the apparent discrete activity
areas. Additional shovel testing should also be undertaken at a future date to determine if buried deposits
extend upslope to the northeast where the soil is thicker.
125

41TV1879
This prehistoric lithic scatter is located along the high terrace edge. The site lies at the base of an upland
slope immediately east of the spot where an unnamed tributary creek formerly had its confluence with the
Colorado River. This upland slope ascends about 30 meters to a prominent ridgetop lobe where site
41TV1865 is located.
The surface geology at 41TV1879 is the Sycamore Sand. A shovel test excavated at the site showed four
discrete soil types in the upper 30 cm, which may indicate a combination of colluvial and alluvial
deposition of grayish-brown and brown clay loams and grayish-brown, silty clay soils. It is also possible
that these soils are mixed and/or redeposited. Deeper, from 30 to 70 cm below ground surface, a light
reddish-brown loam was uncovered in the shovel test. No artifacts were found in the shovel test. These
soils support tall grasses, oaks, and mesquite trees. The site lies at about 680 ft ft msl and is subject to
periodic inundation.
Artifacts found at the site consist of one possible utilized chert flake, numerous interior and biface
thinning flakes, probable burned rocks, and a mano, and a âbitted chopperâ (Figure 78 a) that is very
similar to several other choppers previously found as isolated artifacts in upland settings at Turkey Bend
and discussed above. The site area measures about 46 by 10 meters and review of bathymetry maps
indicate that this terrace bench does not extend any further downslope before steep topography drops to
the original river and tributary creek banks. Although this site is probably severely damaged from
deflation and erosion from wave action, enough remains to perhaps produce additional information. It
would be of particular interest to research any possible connections between this site and nearby sites
41TV1880 and 41TV1865.

41TV1880
This site consists of two separate, side-by-side rockshelters that each measure about 1.5 m deep, 2 m in
width, and 1 m in height. These two rockshelters are about 40 meters apart and are a part of a series of
mostly collapsed and partially collapsed limestone overhangs on the northwest facing slope of an upland
margin ridge. These two are the ones that had the most evidence of soil build up within the overhangs.
The two small rockshelters are located on a steep slope with a small tributary drainage lying about 20
vertical meters below the ground surface within the shelters. Surface geology at this area consists of the
undivided Cow Creek Limestone and Hammett Shale formations. It is obvious that the rock walls of the
shelter are the Cow Creek Limestone.
Rockshelter 2, the southwesternmost of the two shelters, is the only one in which any artifacts were
found. These artifacts consist of a large bifacially worked primary flake that could have functioned as a
chopper found on ground surface within the shelter and a smaller secondary chert flake that was found at
a depth of 5 cm in the only shovel test dug within the shelter. The two artifcats are of very similar
material, and probably represent reduction of the same cobble (Figure 78 b). The shovel test was dug to a
depth of 30 cm without striking bedrock or basal limestone rubble. Others materials observed in the

126

screening of the dark grayish-brown clay loam soil in the shovel test consisted of a few snail shells and
mussel shell fragments.
Only a minimal amount of work has been conducted thus far at the two rockshelters. The deposits within
the shelters should be further tested as should areas where the limestone overhangs have collapsed.
Otherwise, preservation and avoidance of the site area is recommended.

41TV1883 â Prehistoric Component
This site, described also in the Historic Sites section, is a minor prehistoric lithic scatter with mussel shell
located on a high upland margin lobe. The prehistoric component consisted of about a dozen secondary
and tertiary flakes, two or three multidirectional cores and one possible edge-modified flake, as well as a
small amount of mussel shell. No shovel tests were attempted.
Despite the apparent ephemeral nature of the prehistoric component, it is not considered to be fully
documented at this time. Although formal SAL eligibility is highly unlikely, the brief site visit over a
decade ago should be augmented with additional mapping including GPS to confirm the site's location.
Limited shovel testing is also warranted. The prehistoric component of this site is of unknown SAL
eligibility.

41TV1909
This is a prehistoric campsite eroding from the low terrace at the south end of Turkey Bend overlooking
the Colorado River channel. It is one of the few sites recorded in this setting. Cultural material is spread
across the mid- to-upper terrace slope within about a 10 by 10 meter area.
The site lies about 20 feet below the full pool of Lake Travis and becomes exposed when the lake level
drops due to the droughts. The surface geology consists of Holocene alluvium â sand and silt, mostly â 50
feet or more thick. Even when exposed for long periods, little vegetation takes hold on the slope because
of the steep grade and continuous sloughing. However, on the more level terrace surface to the north, a
thick cover of grass and forbs rapidly develops. The site is not situated close to any tributary creek, the
closest water being the river itself.
All cultural material was observed on the eroding terrace slope. The level from which these artifacts
eroded appeared to be about 15 to 20 feet below the terrace edge. However, it was obvious that the
sediments had been slumping and the cultural zone or zones may be higher. Cultural material consists of
a light to moderate scatter of burned limestone rocks, flakes, several manos, and one biface. The amount
of burned rock suggests a single hearth has eroded out of the sediments.
The cultural zone may continue horizontally into the terrace and therefore potentially significant intact
cultural deposits might still exist at this site. For practical purposes, these would be difficult to excavate
due to unpredictable inundation by the lake and the depth of the cultural zone below the terrace surface.
127

The site should still be monitored from time to time to record any significant features that might erode
from the slope.

41TV1959
Site 41TV1959 is a mixed-use site located on the high terrace edge just above 700 ft msl. It overlooks the
large east side drainage to the west and the river channel to the south. It is over the Cow Creek/Hammett
Shale formation in Tarrant soils. Vegetation at the time of recording in 1999 was primarily dense juniper
punctuated by relatively open grassy areas. Situated along a steeply-bordered lobe or ridge below the
high upland ridge system, the site is about 150 by 50 m aligned along the ridge on a roughly north/south
orientation.
Observed cultural material consisted of a scatter of lithic debitage, two middle-stage bifaces, a thin biface,
and several mussel shells. Some clustering of artifacts appeared to be occurring but was difficult to
quantify based on areas of dense vegetation.
This site is considered to be potentially significant based primarily on the potential for soil development
and the limited mapping and testing conducted to date. Its location near major campsites immediately
across the spring-fed drainage suggests some sort of support role for the site, and the relatively sparse
artifact assemblage indicates a limited occupation sequence, possibly eliminating a palimpsest or
overprinting problem. While any development for the site area is highly unlikely at this time, should the
site become threatened then additional mapping and subsurface testing is warranted to make a clearer
SAL determination.

41TV1960
Site 41TV1960 is a high terrace edge mixed-use site located on a small bench overlooking the steep drop
to the Colorado River on the east side of Turkey Bend. Only about 20 m in diameter, the site is in Tarrant
soils over the Sycamore Sand formation. Observed vegetation in 1999 consisted of fairly dense juniper
and oak woods.
The site is similar in many respects to 41TV1959, which is about 200 m to the west. In addition to a light
flake scatter, an edge-modified flake was recovered from the single shovel test at the site. Also observed
were mussel shell, a double-faceted granite mano, and an unidentifiable dart point stem (probably Late
Archaic in age).
While this site is unlikely to be individually eligible for formal SAL status, it needs at least another
reconnaissance-level visit in order to reassess the types and distribution of artifacts. As with 41TV1959,
its fairly remote location and potential single component occupation may be able to further develop
landscape models for settlement pattern analysis.

128

41TV1961
Site 41TV1961 is a mixed-use site and historic trash scatter (discussed in the Historic Sites section)
located in the northwestern "panhandle" section of the upland, eastern portion of the park on the Cow
Creek/Hammett shale formation within Tarrant soils. About 70 m in diameter, the site is on the edge of a
long interfluvial lobe on a landform that begins sloping to the east as it approaches what is probably a
spring-fed drainage that is one of the primary branches of the main east side drainage. Vegetation is
dense juniper along the stream slopes with occasional oak trees and an increase of oaks across the higher,
flatter terrain. The sloping ground surface is boulder-strewn but there is moderate soil development. The
site almost certainly extends into private property to the west.
The site is notable for the diversity of the tool assemblage that included both early- and late-stage bifaces
(including the proximal portion of the thin biface that was collected [Figure 76 e]), unifaces and edgemodified flakes, chopper cores (including one bitted chopper), and groundstone along with mussel shell in
this location far removed from the river. Also, burned rock midden site 41TVTV537 is located about 200
m to the south, on the opposite side of the creek, which is deeply incised into the limestone bedrock and
has several areas where pools of water could be expected to be present under suitable circumstances. Five
widely-spaced shovel tests, which had minimal artifact recovery, found soils ranging in depth from 40 to
70 cm, usually over fractured bedrock.
While at present the site itself is unlikely to eligible for formal SAL status, it is not considered to be fully
investigated. Should there be a future need to more fully determine site eligibility than additional
subsurface testing along with pedestrian survey is warranted to more fully determine if features, organic
preservation, or time-diagnostic artifacts are present.

41TV2360
This is a campsite with burned rock midden deposits located below the full pool of the lake within an inlet
on the southeast side of Turkey Bend. A small, spring-fed creek separates the site from 41TV2361, a
stratified campsite located 20 m to the east. Site 41TV2360 covers a relatively small area of 3,380 sq m
but the cultural deposits there are dense (Figure 62).
The site occupies most of a triangular terrace or point between the spring-fed creek flowing along the
northeast side of the site and a minor tributary drainage entering from the west. The point is composed of
clay and silt alluvium probably derived from overbank flooding from the Colorado River. These
sediments have been deposited against the talus slope and Sycamore Sand conglomerate exposed along
the base of the ridge to the west. When above water for a sufficient length of time, the point becomes
covered by thick herbaceous vegetation.
Most of the northeast quadrant of the site is covered by a dense layer of fire-cracked rock giving the
appearance of one large burned rock midden measuring about 50 m east to west and 30 m north to south.
A shovel test placed within this area encountered two zones of fire-cracked rock, a surface zone 20 cm
thick and below that a second zone of burned rock 30 cm thick (Figure 63).
129

Figure 62. Site 41TV2360.

These zones are separated by 10 cm of soil nearly devoid of cultural material. Most of the artifacts were
recovered from the upper 60 cm of deposits. These include 65 pieces of debitage, a core, and 19 mussel
shells. Between 60 and 80 cm, one piece of debitage and three bone fragments were recovered.
A shovel test was also placed in the southwest corner of site area outside the area of dense surface burned
rocks. This test also encountered two burned rock lenses, one between 35 and 40 cm and the other
between 60 and 65 cm, in addition to moderate amounts of debitage. Because they are thin, these burned
rock lenses could be the outer edges of the two burned rock zones encountered in the shovel test placed in
the burned rock midden.
Two shovel tests were also placed on the south side of the site, one on the terrace surface and a second on
the slope below. Together, these tests sampled a column of terrace sediments two meters thick. Artifact
recovery was low with a single burned rock and one flake near the terrace surface and a few mussel
shells, burned rocks, and one flake from the shovel test on the slope corresponding to a depth of between
one and two meters below the terrace surface. While artifact recovery was low, these tests suggest that
some fairly deep components might be present.

130

Figure 63. Shovel test at 41TV2360.

Artifacts observed on the surface include a dense scatter of debitage, cores, biface fragments, manos,
metate fragments, and mussel shells. Four projectile points were collected from the surface in or close to
the surface accumulation of burned rock: a reworked Andice, a Nolan, a Castroville, and an untyped Late
Archaic point (Figure 75 a, b, c, d).
Although both this site and the nearby 41TV2361 have unusually dense surface accumulations of burned
rock and lithics, they went undetected by archeological surveys in the park until 2009. Obviously, these
sites are only visible when the lake level is below 650 feet. Once exposed however, vegetation rapidly
covers these areas, obscuring the archeological material. Also, the very fact that the burned rocks are so
dense, and at 41TV2360 cover such a large area, that they appear from a distance to be gravel bars.
Natural gravels derived from conglomerates are common in the inlet.
This site contains at least two cultural zones. The upper zone from the surface down to 20 cm has
probably been disturbed as indicated by the presence of Asian clams, a species introduced in the twentieth
century. The lower cultural zone, from 30 to 60 cm, appears intact and probably has high research
potential. Both zones should be considered potentially significant and the site as a whole merits SAL
designation. Since the site lies below the full pool of the lake, construction is unlikely to occur over this
site with a few possible exceptions. Boat docks, either floating or stationary, should not be allowed over
the site and no dredging should be allowed in the inlet. Also, it is recommended that the site be
monitored from time to time when the lake is below 650 feet, especially to see if any illegal digging has
occurred. Fortunately, no major looting has yet been reported at this site.

131

41TV2361

This is a stratified campsite on a spring-fed creek across from 41TV2360 in an inlet on the southeast side
of Turkey Bend (Figure 64). It covers an area of 1,130 m2 at the south end of a high, narrow spur of
terrace deposits on the north side of the inlet near the entry to the lake. The site lies below the full pool of
the lake and is only completely exposed when the lake drops below 660 feet. The terrace is composed of
Holocene alluvium, mostly silt in the upper sediments, 20 feet or more thick over the Sycamore Sand
formation. Soils are most likely of the Pedernales series.
When the lake completely recedes from the cove, the creek can be seen to bend around the southern end
of the terrace. The southwest face of the terrace is almost shear and appears to be eroding laterally toward
the northeast. This is confirmed by the bands of burned rock and artifacts that have eroded out of the
terrace and redeposited at the base of the cutbank. About a half dozen tree stumps are scattered across the
terrace surface. Long exposure above water allows a fairly thick carpet of grasses and forbs to grow on
this nearly level surface but the slopes are generally too steep for much vegetation to take hold.
Two shovel tests placed on the terrace surface recovered moderate amounts of debitage, a mussel shell,
and a very small amount of burned rock (100 g) in the upper 80 cm of sediments. Deeper strata of
scattered burned rocks and debitage can be seen in the southwest cutbank. One of the most distinct of
these buried components lies about 15 feet below the terrace surface. On this same cutbank midway up a
less steep area to the south lies a fairly dense concentration of burned rocks that apparently eroded out the
upper terrace sediments. The amount of burned rock suggests they represent a small burned rock midden
or large hearth bed. Scattered burned rock and a burned rock cluster were also observed on the east side
of the terrace surface where it begins to slope down toward the creek channel.
Besides burned rock, most of the cultural material consists of debitage. Groundstone was not noted in the
survey records but is probably present. The only tools recorded are a uniface from the surface (Figure 77
b) and an edge-modified flake recovered from one of the shovel tests from a depth of 20 to 40 cm (Figure
77 a).
While the cultural deposits at this site are not as dense as those of 41TV2360, the individual components
might be more significant because they appear to be buried in widely separated strata. It is still not
known how far these buried cultural deposits extend back into the terrace. Both sites lie below the full
pool of the lake and probably wonât be threatened by construction. If for some reason they are threatened,
both sites should be tested. The buried deposits at 41TV2361 are deep and probably inaccessible by
conventional subsurface testing methods such as shovel or auger testing.

Other Sites
The following section provides summary data on the remaining 40 prehistoric sites that were not
described above. These are sites that are considered ineligible for formal designation as SALs and did not
lend themselves to more detailed discussion. They are grouped by site type with enough information to
allow an independent assessment of proposed site significance.

Lithic Procurement Sites
There are 10 total lithic procurement sites or locales. Six are located within an upland setting, three along
the high terrace edge, and one that falls along the riverside elevation. All are within the Sycamore Sand
formation and they are equally split between Travis and Tarrant soils, with two sites overlapping both
soils. Without exception the procurement activities were taking place in gravel deposits of at least
Pleistocene age â and which drape much of the high terrace edge along the southern portion of the bend.
Such deposits are also common directly downstream at Muleshoe Bend, which is topographically lower
and has areas of extremely dense gravels and in some cases extraordinarily large clasts. These gravels
can be contrasted with the pronounced conglomerates present most strikingly on the western, upstream
side of Turkey Bend.

133

The identified lithic procurement sites at Turkey Bend consist of 41BT200, 202, 204, 329, 331, and
41TV1855, 1856, 1858, 1860 and 1862. They are all along the high terrace edge or in some cases
removed far enough for the edge to be considered upland settings. None has evidence of intensive use,
and recent revisits of some failed to find many artifacts at all. In general though, they contain tested
cobbles, cores, large flakes and sometimes early-stage bifaces. It would appear that raw lithic materials
are so abundant locally that there was no need for repetitive use of any single locale at a level of intensity
that would produce highly visible cultural materials. The lower quality of these gravels as compared to
other forms of chert, especially those found in Edwards Limestone formations, suggests that prehistoric
people making use of Turkey Bend simply brought in much of the stone tool material with them. The
lithic procurement sites at Turkey Bend are therefore useful in aiding with reconstruction of general land
use patterns, but individually lack research value that would make them eligible for SAL status.

Lithic Scatters
Lithic scatters, those sites with little more than chert debitage â and sometimes tools â not clearly related
to lithic procurement activities, are represented by 16 sites in this section. Twelve of the 16 are within
upland settings and the remaining four are along the high terrace edge. None were identified in
riverside/floodplain settings. Eight are within Cow Creek/Hammett Shale, seven are within Sycamore
Sand, and one was located within Hensell Sand. All were within Tarrant soils.
While lithic scatters are notoriously difficult to interpret, including at Turkey Bend, they can be of interest
as hypothetical representatives of specific tasks (logistical forays) or generalized movement across the
landscape. Wherever such sites may fall into such continuum, they illustrate locations at which tasks
were accomplished, if only the refreshing of a stone tool. So while the following sites are considered to
have exhausted their research potential individually, they are still useful in more fully defining prehistoric
land use.
The lithic scatters in the following are divided into two categories. The first (Type 1) consist of very
minor amounts of material in a very limited area. The second category (Type 2) contains sites that may
cover a larger area, may have tools and tool diversity and in some cases bits of mussel shell present. The
two, of course, grade into one another along something of a continuum.
Type 1 lithic scatters (n=6) are comprised of 41BT190, 193, 197, 198, 199, and 341. Except for
41BT190, located on the high terrace edge, they are all in upland settings. Site 41BT190 was documented
as a single flake. Site 41BT193 contained about six interior flakes, a few chunks and a single heavily
weathered dart point fragment. Site 41BT197 had three cores and two burned chunks. Site 41BT198 had
three flakes and at least two cores, including a bitted chopper. Site 41BT199 was very similar to
41BT198. Site 41BT341 had five flakes, a core, three thick bifaces and one bitted chopper. These sites
are all in areas with very shallow soils and at least reasonable visibility, and no there are no suggestions
that additional research potential is forthcoming.
Type 2 lithic scatters (n=10) are 41BT327, 330, 468, 41TV1852, 1854, 1885, 1958, 1962, 1963 and 1965.
Seven sites are in upland settings and three along the high terrace edge. Site 41BT327 was a discrete
134

scatter containing several secondary and tertiary flakes, two choppers and a unidirectional core along with
one thin and two thick bifaces. These were at the end of a lobe in a good lookout location. Site 41BT330
is described as a lithic scatter containing 15-20 cores, about a dozen primary and secondary flakes and a
possible edge-modified flake located within an area of gravels. Because it was spatially restricted within
the larger area of gravels it was not considered to be a lithic procurement locale but rather a discrete
activity area. Site 41BT468 contained three or four flakes, a unifacially retouched hard hammer flake and
a dart point preform, once again located on a lobe tip in an area that could be considered a lookout. Site
41TV1852 was a light, discrete scatter overlooking a drainage system. It contained a very few flakes and
a heavily patinated projectile point fragment with Paleoindian characteristics (Figure 76 b). Site
41TV1854 contained a chopper core, a core, a bifacially reduced flake and scattered possible burned
sandstone on a lobe tip. A "crusher" was also collected (Figure 77 g). Site 41TV1885 had a core, two
thick bifaces, two thin bifaces, about 20 tertiary flakes and a few secondary flakes in a discrete area. Site
41TV1958 had about 15 flakes and two unifaces in a discrete area. Site 41TV1962 is a poorly recorded
lithic scatter with a very few flakes, some possible tools and a small amount of mussel shell near the
upland head of a drainage system. Site 41TV1963 is very similar to 41TV1962 and is located about 130
m east at the head of the same drainage system. It was recorded with about 10 decorticate flakes, a thin
biface, a uniface, a chopper core, and a mussel shell fragment. Site 41TV1965 was a discontinuous lithic
scatter across the top of a ridge system between two drainages to the river. There were numerous flakes,
mostly secondary and tertiary, a few cores, a bitted chopper, a sandstone metate fragment, a quartzite
mano and two Archaic-aged projectile points. Although there were areas where materials were more
concentrated, no distinct patterning was recognized, but areas of dense vegetation may have obscured
additional artifacts.

Mixed Use
There are 11 mixed-use sites not described above. These are defined as having evidence of food remains
or other resource processing but lacking evidence of definite camping (fire-cracked rock). Six of these
sites are within Cow Creek/Hammett Shale, and five in Sycamore Sand. Nine are in Tarrant soils and two
in Travis. Nine are in upland settings and two along the high terrace edge.
As with lithic scatters, mixed-use sites are indicative of ephemeral or short term activities, and therefore
often lack the type of integrity necessary for addressing specific research questions. They do, however,
provide opportunities to address landscape and settlement patterning questions when looking at them
within broader contexts. Lithic scatters and mixed-use sites grade into each other descriptively. A
number of mixed-uses sites were largely procurement-related but included groundstone artifacts.
Site 41BT189 contained two pieces of debitage, a shattered granite mano and a possible sandstone mano.
Site 41BT196 was recorded within a gravel deposit and contained numerous pieces of debitage â mostly
large secondary flakes â several cores, four ealry-stage bifaces, but also as many as four manos, one made
of quartzite. Site 41BT203 is described as a lithic procurement site on the original site form, containing
several cores and large flakes within a gravel deposit. A single sandstone metate fragment caused the site
to be reclassified as a mixed-use site for this discussion. Site 41BT324 included a historic component,
described in the Historic section, in addition to relatively dense procurement related artifacts. The
135

presence of an apparent abrading stone (several grooves across a piece of sandstone) as well as possible â
but non-quantifiable â burned limestone caused the site to be reclassified as mixed use. Inadvertent brush
clearing allowed the site to be revisited with improved visibility demonstrating low research potential.
Site 41BT326 is an upland lithic scatter with flakes and cores near the head of a drainage. It is
categorized as a mixed-use site based upon a sandstone metate fragment found near a dart point fragment.
Site 41BT334 was a small, relatively discrete site with a few flakes, three cores, an ealry-stage biface
along with three broken manos. Possible burned sandstone was also present. Apparent small-scale food
processing was therefore occurring near lithic resources. Site 41BT335 is primarily a lithic procurement
site in gravel deposits, where cores and large flakes were common. Once again, the presence of two
metate fragments resulted in it being considered a mixed-use site. Site 41TV535 is an extremely deflated
lithic scatter for which only two manos could be located during a 1997 revisit. Site 41TV1881 is a fairly
extensive, mostly buried lithic scatter with a few epics of groundstone for which 11 shovel tests in sandy
soils found no evidence of discrete components, features, or organic preservation. Site 41TV1884 is a
partially buried upland lithic scatter with about 10 pieces of debitage, a sandstone metate and mano were
observed. Informal shovel probes demonstrated limited research potential. Site 41TV1964 is a relatively
dense site along the eastern upland boundary. It has numerous flakes, a metate fragment, two manos, at
least two middle- to late-stage bifaces, a dart point, scattered mussel shell and a bone fragment. Seven
shovel tests found pocketed, shallow soils. The site has been disturbed by past clearing and ranching
activities, and research potential is limited.

Open Camps
Of 21 prehistoric open camps, five are considered to be fully investigated and ineligible for consideration
as SALs. Two of these sites, 41TV1851 and 41BT473, have already been described in order to place
other, nearby sites into greater context. Of the remaining three sites, two are in riverside settings and one
is along the high terrace edge. These sites are deflated, disturbed and/or have been tested at a level
sufficient to demonstrate that research potential is exhausted.
Site 41BT459 is located on the floodplain on the western portion of the bend. It consists of scattered
burned rock, mussel shell, debitage and a few tools, including an Ensor point (Figure 75 h) and an arrow
point (Figure 76 d), which were both collected. It was observed to be within the active lakeshore and is
clearly deflated. While there may be other intact deposits on the more stable, upper terrace, the site, as
presently defined, is not considered to be SAL eligible.
Site 41TV1849 is a high terrace edge campsite with dense cultural deposits that has been actively looted,
clearly for decades. Prior to a development project the site was intensively shovel tested, and following
consultation with THC was determined to be not eligible for formal SAL status (Malof 2009).
Site 41TV1853 is located on the river side terrace system below 41TV1849. While it has dense cultural
deposits, two shovel tests and examination of looter profiles and other exposures indicate that there is
little potential for isolable components to be present. It should be noted that a local informant said that
prehistoric human remains had been seen at the very lowest portion of the site several years ago. There is

136

absolutely no indication that the site has the potential to still have such deposits. The site is not
considered to be SAL eligible.

Prehistoric Sites Summary
Of the 74 prehistoric components, there are 10 lithic procurement sites (14 percent), 24 lithic scatters (32
percent), 18 mixed-use sites (24 percent), and 22 open camps (30 percent) (Figure 65). Site locations,
determined by centroids, were compared across environmental setting (riverside, side drainage, high
terrace edge, and uplands) and across the different geologic formations. There are 34 sites within uplands
(46 percent), 19 along the high terrace edge (26 percent), 12 along the riverside (16 percent), and nine
along the two main side drainages (12 percent) (Figure 66). Note that if the side drainages are added to
the riverside count those sites make up 28 percent of the total. Figure 67 shows that sites within the side
drainages are comprised exclusively of open campsites. Along the riverside, 75 percent of sites are open
camps and 24 percent are other types (n=1 each). Along the high terrace edge 37 percent of sites are
lithic scatters and 32 percent are mixed-use. Within the uplands 47 percent are lithic scatters and 32
percent are mixed-use. (Rounding error accounts for percentage total discrepancies above.)

Uplands and the high terrace edge have the lowest percentage of such sites, which is not surprising, given

site types have the lowest percentage of perceived significance (Figure 69).

Figure 68. Percentage of prehistoric sites considered significant or potentially significant (Y=yes, N=no) within

Sites were compared across the major geological formations, Cow Creek/Hammet Shale (KcH), Hensell
Sand (Kh), Sycamore Sand (KsY) and Holocene alluvial deposits (Qal). Over 50 percent of prehistoric
components are within the KsY formation, which makes up only 25 percent of the landform. The
seeming greater-than-expected number of sites in KsY may be explained by scouring and/or buried sites
with Qal, as might the environmental within KsY. Figure 71 supports the latter explanation, as there is a
very similar number of all site types present in Sycamore Sand.
Given that the KsY formation has the highest number and greatest diversity of sites, it is not surprising
that it also has the greatest number of potentially significant sites (Figure 72). It is interesting, though,
that open camp sites, which make up almost 25 percent of potentially significant sites (Figure 73), are
more commonly significant in KsY than in Qal (Figure 74). Once again, this may be more a function of
sampling error (visibility, post-depositional processes) than actual settlement patterning.

Potentially significant mixed-use sites, meanwhile, are found in almost equal percentages in
Cow/Creek/Hammett Shale and in Sycamore Sand, and as a whole mixed-use sites and lithic scatters are
divided about equally between the two formations. Various resources, while probably patchy and
unevenly divided, were likely of near equal importance for prehistoric foragers.

Turkey Bend, with its high density of prehistoric archaeological sites, including a large number of
campsites, demonstrates landscape use across a broad array of time. While isolatable components may
not be present, and if they are, impossible to relate directly to other aspects of the landscape, it is still
possible to use the park as a means of better understanding prehistoric lifeways in general, and in
particular along the eastern portion of the Edwards Plateau. Informed research designs, perhaps with a
focus on Late Archaic technology and subsistence, can potentially address larger questions regarding
prehistoric settlement in the region.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

At a little over 1,300 acres, Turkey Bend makes up about 11 percent of LCRA's 12,000 acres of holdings
along Lake Travis. At present, there are 316 archaeological sites documented on these lands, 78 of which
are at Turkey Bend. Turkey Bend therefore has about 25 percent of all known sites on lands owned by
LCRA along Lake Travis. This remarkable statistic may be partially explained by differing levels of
investigations, but is perhaps more likely the result of environmental diversity within a fairly constrained
area. The combination of river, spring-fed drainages, floodplains, presumably open uplands and steep,
shelter-bearing canyons and bluffs attracted both historic and prehistoric settlers.
The historic settlement sequence is fairly well established. At the end of the Civil War the founding of
the Henry Thomas Lodge indicates an operative social infrastructure was in place. Earliest settlers
included John and Emily Burton, who were in Burnet County, and presumably Turkey Bend, sometime
between 1855 and 1858. As other families arrived, a small, dispersed community developed with a local
school and probably a church, although there is no evidence any type of store was present.
The families that lived or had a presence at Turkey Bend when lands were acquired by LCRA were the
same that first settled â Phillips, Boultinghouse, Burton and Hall. They farmed and ranched for their
livelihoods and conducted business in the surrounding small communities and larger towns such as
141

Marble Falls and Austin. Other than the Hall place, which is on private property, there are no standing
structures. Two cisterns and a cattle dipping vat are the most substantial remains left. There are a few
fencelines, foundation stones, and trash scatters to remind a visitor of the past inhabitants.
Turkey Bend has a rich prehistoric legacy. While many of the prehistoric locales â sites â are not
necessarily significant in a regulatory sense, they do allow a fairly complete picture of local and perhaps
regional land use to be better understood. In addition to large riverside campsites, Turkey Bend also has
very small, discrete camps along the side drainages, where very small groups, presumably families,
gathered for short periods of time. People clearly used riverine resources, including mussels and almost
certainly fish, hunted game with available technology, and gathered vegetal resources in uplands, leaving
behind the necessary processing and acquisition tools.
While it is unknown what the local carrying capacity was at any one point in the past, the relative
abundance of Late Archaic-aged artifacts are consistent with presumed population increases during that
time. Resource intensification may have led to decreased levels of residential mobility as people settled
in and gathered low-ranked food items such as mussels, or conversely, increased mobility as groups
moved further in search of depleted food resources such as higher-ranked game animals. Certainly, at
times in the prehistoric past, the area around Turkey Bend would have been sufficient to meet the
subsistence needs of small groups for extended periods.
The 78 documented archaeological sites at Turkey Bend have a combined total of 87 components, with a
multicomponent site defined as one with both historic and prehistoric materials. Table 2 lists all sites,
sorted on trinomial, with the primary component listed first. For example, a historic homestead with a
minor lithic scatter will be listed first as a historic site, and secondly as a lithic scatter. Most sites will
have the same descriptor for both component columns.
Significance recommendations are offered for both components, but in only two cases (41BT322,
41TV1883) is the secondary component considered to be potentially significant. There are a total of 24
sites that are either considered to be potentially eligible or of unknown eligibility for SAL status. There
are no SAL-listed sites at Turkey Bend. It is the opinion of LCRA Cultural Resource Services staff that
four prehistoric component sites, 41BT391, 41TV1850, 41TV2360 and 41TV2361, are clearly eligible for
SAL status. These sites all appear to have integrity of deposits and a high probability of being able to
provide valuable information if they were to be excavated.
Table 3 summarizes the 87 components by site type, and subdivides the types by significance ratings.
There are 30 components considered eligible or potentially eligible, including a double count for the two
sites with two separate potentially eligible components each. Open camps (which, for the purpose of
categorizations include rockshelters) and mixed-use sites have the highest percentage of eligible or
potentially eligible sites. There are three lithic scatters of potential or unknown eligibility, but no lithic
procurement sites. There are only two historic components of potential or unknown eligibility. Sites with
unknown potential, or considered potentially eligible for SAL status should not be adversely impacted
until they can be assessed and a final eligibility determination made. Eligible sites may require mitigation
if impacts cannot be avoided.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

The LCRA is proposing to build a boundary fence around a portion of newly-acquired property north of
their original holdings at West Cave Preserve in western Travis County (Figure 80). One section of the
new fence will replace an old ranch fence that runs along the east side of Hamilton Pool Road between
West Cave Creek and Hammetts Crossing Road, a distance of 561 feet (171 meters). From there the
fence will run in an easterly direction parallel to Hammetts Crossing Road offset about 10 feet (3 meters)
to the south for 1,493 linear feet (455 meters) and then will turn away from the road and run due east for
an additional 669 feet (204 meters) to the canyon edge overlooking the Pedernales River. The new fence
will run through land formally used as cattle range. The total linear feet of the new fence will come to
about 2,723 feet (830 meters).
The fence will consist of welded wire mesh supported by T-posts with metal pipe bracing and posts at
corners and along curves. Jackhammers and post drivers will be used to implant the posts into the ground
because of the shallow depth of bedrock. Small juniper trees under 20 feet and brush may need to be
cleared.
Archaeologists from the LCRA conducted a cultural resource survey of the proposed fence line on March
13, 2012, which resulted in the recording of one new archeological site, 41TV2405, and a revisit of a
second archeological site, 41TV877. The portions of both sites within the project area were assessed as
ineligible for State Archeological Landmark (SAL) designation because of the low density of cultural
material, erosion of deposits, and lack of features. Since the project will not impact any SALs or portions
of sites eligible for SAL designation, the project should be allowed to proceed as currently planned.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

The project area is located on the Edwards plateau on the western edge of Travis County. Most of the
West Cave Preserve outside the canyons is underlain by the Hensell sand formation of Cretaceous age
with small areas of Cow Creek limestone at the eastern end near the canyon rim of the Pedernales River
(Barnes 1981). Volente soils have been mapped over most of the project area, developing on slope
alluvium found along West Cave Creek (Werchan et al. 1974). Volente soils are deep â their A horizons
are typically three feet (90 cm) thick and composed of silty clay loam. The Tarrant soils that formed on
the limestone at the east end of the project area are thin, typical 12 inches (30 cm) thick over bedrock, and
composed of clay.
The deep Volente soil support mesquite trees at the northwestern corner of the Preserve, along with
junipers and live oaks. Common understory woody species include agarita and persimmon. Several
species of cactus were also noted on the survey. In general, the project area is open grassland maintained
by frequent brush clearings.

METHODOLOGY

A file search found that no archeological sites had been recorded in the project area, although a
prehistoric procurement site, 41TV877, was recorded in an area immediately south of the east end of the
proposed fence route. The field survey involved walking the entire route of the proposed fence line and
placing shovel tests in areas were the soil appeared deep and ground visibility was poor. Tests were also
placed in locations with surface artifacts to determine the depth and horizontal extent of the cultural
deposits. Six shovel tests were dug during the survey; their soils profiles are given in the Appendix table.
Along the segment that will replace the existing fence on the east side of Hamilton Pool Road, the survey
concentrated on the area within a few feet of the highway ROW. No shovel testing was done since this
area has been disturbed by road construction and partially covered by rip-wrap (limestone rocks) in places
and ground visibility was above 30 percent (Figure 81). Along the segment that will runs parallel to
Hammetts Crossing Road, a 25-foot-(7.6 meter)-wide corridor adjacent to south road edge was surveyed.
Because of disturbances and good visibility, only one shovel test was excavated along this segment
(Figure 82). Several road cuts provided a good profile of the soil overlying the bedrock (Figure 83). The
final segment running eastwards from Hammetts Crossing road to the Canyon rim of the Pedernales River
was surveyed within a roughly 25-foot-(7.6 meter)-wide corridor. Bedrock exposures in this area were
common and soil occurred in small pockets (Figure 84). Because of the lack of soil and good visibility,
no shovel tests were placed along this segment.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

The archeological potential of the limestone karst features of the West Cave area attracted the attention of
A.T. Jackson in the late 1930s. He recorded the West Cave grotto as an archeological site (later
designated 41TV57) because of the potential for cultural deposits within the shelter. Nearby where the
county road crossed the Pedernales River, Jackson recorded a terrace site with lithics and mussel shell,
which was later given the designation 41TV244. He also recorded the Hamilton Pool sinkhole east of the
Pedernales River as an archeological site, noting that prehistoric cultural material was present along the
rim above, but not within, the sinkhole.
In 1959, the areaâs karst features also attracted the attention of a University of Texas student, J. Milburn
Lathan, who conducted test excavations in shelters within West Cave Canyon, along the Pedernales
River, and especially along Cypress Creek (Lathan 1959). Lathan placed a 2 X 2 foot test unit in a small
shelter (41TV56) in West Cave Canyon 200 yards upstream from the Pedernales River. Although his test
recovered charcoal and ash to a depth of 1 foot, along with a stone knife fragment and a projectile point,
he felt the cave was not worth further investigation. Lathan also excavated a 2 X 2 foot test pit in the West
Cave grotto (41TV57) which failed to recover any artifacts. He did collect a Clear Fork gouge from the
surface of the grotto, apparently the only prehistoric artifact known from this site.
In 1984, the LCRA hired Prewitt and Associates to conduct an archeological survey of their holdings at
West Cave Preserve, which then amounted to 10 acres (Jackson and Girard 1984). The survey was done
by a two person crew in one day and resulted in the recording of one new lithic procurement site,
163

41TV877, and a revisit of the West Cave grotto (41TV57) where no cultural material was seen. They
could not relocate Lathanâs shelter site (41TV56). A lithic scatter on the canyon rim was also
investigated and, for some reason, was thought to be Jacksonâs terrace site, 41TV244.

RESULTS

One new archeological site, 41TV2405, was recorded and the boundaries of a previously recorded site,
41TV877, were expanded. These sites are shown in Figure 85.

Figure 85. Locations of sites within the project area on Hammetts Crossing USGS quad.

41TV2405 (new site)
This site is located in the northwest corner of the West Cave Preserve where Hammetts Crossing Road
junctions with Hamilton Pool Road (Figure 86). The site is situated on a low, south-facing slope
immediately north of West Cave Creek, a dry streambed running in a southeasterly direction. About 80
164

meters farther downstream, the creek begins to enter West Cave Canyon where the West Cave grotto is
located. The site area is mostly open grassland or savanna with widely scattered mesquite, ashe juniper,
and live oak trees and a sparse understory of agarita and persimmon. The west end of the site has been
destroyed by a barrow pit, 25 meters in length east to west and feathering out about 13 meters south of the
Hammetts Crossing Road fence. The north or upslope wall of the barrow cut is 40 cm deep exposing
brown clay loam soil, while the floor of the pit is composed of reddish-brown soil. No artifacts were seen
protruding from the wall of this cutbank.

Figure 86. Map of surveyed area of 41TV2405, project area in blue.

One loose cluster of 10 fire-cracked limestone rocks, presumably a scattered hearth, was seen outside the
project area on the south edge of the site about seven meters north of the creek channel. Approximately
20 flakes were seen in the surveyed area, four of them blade-like, and most covered by a white patina
(Figure 87). One combination end and side scraper was also noted.
All of the cultural material was observed on the surface of the barrow pit cut and floor or in eroded areas
leading to the creek. Two shovel tests placed along the Hamilton Pool Road fence and three others
paralleling Hammetts Crossing Road failed to recover any cultural material. These tests were all placed in
areas that seem to have intact soil. Presumably the artifact density is extremely low or the intact soil lies
just outside the site area.
165

The surface of this site that was surveyed for the fence project contains few artifacts although artifact
density appears to increase to the south and east toward the creek channel outside the project area. The
presence of blades might mean a possible Toyah or even Clovis component. No diagnostic artifacts were
seen.

inch (2.54 cm) across.

41TV877 (revisit)
This site was originally recorded by Prewitt and Associates in 1984 in the area immediately north of the
West Cave Canyon rim (Jackson and Girard 1984). With the current investigation, the site boundaries
have expanded to 11 acres bounded by the canyon rims of the Pedernales River on the east and West
Cave Creek on the south. The western edge of the site lies about 360 meters west of the Pedernales
canyon rim, and the north edge of the site about 160 meters north of the West Cave Creek canyon rim.
The site covers a southeast-trending slope overlooking the canyons of the Pedernales River and West
Cave Creek. The slope is covered by scattered live oaks and junipers and is mostly open grassland. Low
limestone outcrops are frequent to the south and east. Upslope at an elevation of 830 feet, the bedrock is
covered by 40 cm or more of gravels and cobbles capped by a thin layer of soil. A paved road runs
through these gravel deposits (see Figure 83).
Two discrete areas of burned rock at the extreme western end of the site are probably scattered hearths,
otherwise no features were seen. These rocks lie about 10 meters south of the project area. The siteâs
artifact assemblage includes a dozen unfinished bifaces of various thicknesses, several cores, several
dozen, mostly cortical, flakes, noted on the gravels. One shovel test placed about 10 meters north of the
burned rocks recovered five pieces of debitage but no burned rocks.
166

No finished tools were seen and site probably formed through repeated use as a lithic procurement locale.
Natural chert cobbles mixed with lithic cultural material are present on the slope at the north end of the
surveyed site area and probably continue to the north onto private land. Artifact density is low with many
chert cobbles apparently broken by machinery. The area between the old and new roads to the southeast
of the burned rocks looks undisturbed and might harbor buried, but shallow, cultural deposits. Within the
project area though, no burned rocks were seen.

RECOMMENDATIONS

Two archeological sites are present within the proposed fence construction area. From surface indications
outside the project area, 41TV2405 appears to represent the edge of a prehistoric campsite but shovel
testing in the narrow strip of intact soil adjacent to the Hammetts Cross Road fence failed to recover any
artifacts. Presumably the cultural deposits in this area are extremely sparse and unlikely to yield any
meaningful information on the site. Areas to the south and east outside the project area were given a
cursory inspection and cultural material continues to the southeast along the north side of West Cave
Creek. Future investigations in this direction may find areas of 41TV2405 that are potentially significant

167

for archeological research but the portions of the site within the project area do not appear to merit SAL
designation.
The previously recorded site, 41TV877, is primarily a lithic procurement locale. Such sites are rarely
designated SALs because they contain temporally-mixed cultural material and lack features such as
hearths. Some burned rock was noted outside the project area, so other areas of 14TV877 might contain
deposits eligible for SAL designation. However, even this is unlikely because of the thin soil cover and
disturbances caused by road construction when the land was in private hands. In any case, the portion of
41TV877 that lies within the project area does not appear to merit SAL designation.
Since no SAL sites or potential SAL sites are present within the proposed fence construction area, the
project should be allowed to proceed as planned.

INTRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

LCRA proposes to rebuild an existing transmission line that runs for a distance of 9.4 miles between the
existing San Bernard Electrical Coopâs Colorado Substation and a connection point on an existing South
Texas Electrical Coop-owned transmission line (Figure 89, Figure 90). The entirety of the project is
located in southern Colorado County. The project will consist of replacing the existing mostly H-frame
configured support structures with primarily single pole structures and a few lattice structures at select
points within a 50-foot-wide ROW. Foundations will be between 42 and 72 inches in diameter and up to
20 feet deep.
Portions of the project area were surveyed by Espey, Huston and Associates in 1991, when prehistoric
lithic scatter 41CD125 was recorded and recommended for avoidance (Kotter 1991). The present
investigation consisted of revisiting site 41CD125 in order to confirm previous avoidance and to assess
two stream crossings that appeared to have a relatively high probability for containing archaeological
sites. As a result of the survey, site 41CD125 appears to have been largely avoided, and no other
archaeological sites were recorded. It is recommended that the project be allowed to proceed without
additional cultural resource survey investigations, with the understanding the avoidance measure will be
maintained for 41CD125. No artifacts were collected so no curation will be necessary.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

The project area is within the Gulf Coastal Plain region in an area underlain by the Middle Pleistocene
Lissie formation, which is comprised of sand, silt and clay and some gravels in places (Barnes 1974).
Along Middle Sandy Creek, where 41CD125 is located, is a narrow band of Holocene alluvium. Soils are
mapped as the Katy-Hockley-Clodine association, which are alfisols typically having a thin, loamy A
horizon over clayey subsoils (Godfrey et. al 1973). Along Middle Sandy Creek the soils are mapped as
Kuy and Rupley sands, which are both very deep and soft entisols and alfisols, respectively. Besides
Middle Sandy Creek the project area is drained by Bucksnag Creek and is near the headwaters of West
Turkey Creek, which all eventually feed the Navidad River before it flows into Lavaca Bay. While
cropland is common in the area, especially for rice, there is still a high percentage of Post Oak Woods and
Forest, which as the name implies is dominated by various oak species, although numerous forbs and
grasses are also present (McMahon et. al 1984).

CULTURAL BACKGROUND

While the project area might be considered to be within the Central Texas archaeological region (see Ellis
et al. 1995) it is more accurate to define it as within the Central Coastal Plains region (Mercado-Allinger
1996:13), an Upland Prairies and Woods setting (Mercado-Allinger 1996:25). Prehistoric cultural
affinities as defined by projectile point style distributions suggest strong influences from both central
Texas and from the southeast including Louisiana, and occasionally from northeast Texas (Patterson
1995:255). The suggestion of neighboring Wharton County as being in a transitional zone has also been
applied to Colorado County and points northward (Keller and Campbell 1984:24), while maintaining a
primary relationship with central Texas. Regardless, there seems to be agreement that all phases of
prehistory, as modeled in Central Texas, are present within the project area.
At present, there are only 150 recorded archaeological sites in Colorado County, an increase of only 25
sites since the recording of 41CD125 over 20 years ago. A review of the online Archeological Sites Atlas
suggests this may be at least partly a function of a dearth of investigations, especially in the southern
portion of the county. The vast majority of recorded sites are clustered in the northern part of the county
along the Colorado River. However, a recent LCRA survey (Malof and Prikryl 2011) suggests that
prehistoric sites may indeed be scarce or perhaps have very low visibility in terms of artifacts, at least in
the area between El Campo and Eagle Lake.
Early Anglo settlers in these two counties first arrived in the mid-1820s and were members of Stephen F.
Austinâs Old Three Hundred colonists. Their land grants were mostly located along the Colorado River
in southeastern Wharton County and in central Colorado County. Many of these settlers brought black
slaves as laborers and farm workers. Colorado County was formed in 1836 with Columbus as the county
seat (Odintz 2011).
Early agricultural development before the Civil War followed the southern plantation system with slave
labor being used to burn wooded areas which were then planted in corn, cotton, and sugar cane. At the
time of the Civil War, the value of acreage in neighboring Wharton County was the highest of any county
in the state, and about 70 percent of the countyâs population was slaves. In Colorado County, there was a
larger number of small farms existing alongside the large plantations. In particular, cotton and sugarcane
were important products in both counties. Although no fighting occurred during the Civil War, the areaâs
economy was ruined (Hudgins 2011).
A number of small communities developed along what is now US 90A during the late 1800s after the San
Antonio and Aransas Railway was established. Sheridan was a major producer of figs and other truckfarm produce (Carroll 2012). Rock Island was originally named for a nearby creek but was renamed for
the Rock Island railroad Company (Largent 2012). Cheatham, which now consists of only a cemetery,
was named for the first postmaster, and originally was a cordwood producer (Odintz 2012). These towns
all declined in size and economy after the railroad was abandoned following WW II.
Few substantial archaeological surveys have been conducted in Colorado County. Work by SWCA for a
pipeline project resulted in the discovery of human bones in soils thought to date about 600 years in age
175

(41CD130). This was located near the Colorado River west of SH 71 about 5 miles west of Eagle Lake.
Site 41CD39, located on the north side of Eagle Lake in a residential setting, was originally recorded by
Mike Collins for the Texas Archaeological Salvage Project in 1966. The landowner had collected a
Scottsbluff point, two gouges, one of which was a Clearfork, as well as unifaces. A revisit by others in
1978 did not reveal any substantial additional information.
Site 41CD61 is located near the mouth of Skull Creek, where it joins the Colorado River. James Sherrill
determined that in addition to being a prehistoric campsite it was also the location of one of La Salleâs
camp sites, although no specific artifacts linking such an event were described on the site form. Five
other previously recorded sites (41CD50-55) on Skull Creek about 12 miles north of the project area have
been vaguely described as lithic scatters situated on gravelly hills and containing artifacts that are âmostly
crude Archaic ageâ specimens. A short distance downstream on Skull Creek another prehistoric lithic
scatter that yielded two Ensor type dart points was recorded by avocational archaeologist Bobby Raley in
1983. This site was revisited by archaeologists from SWCA in 1995 during the Mid Texas pipeline survey
project. SWCA described the site as a disturbed lithic scatter/procurement area situated on a gravelly
knoll. The site was assessed as not significant.
Local avocational archaeologist Joe Hudgins has recorded a number of lithic scatters in the region, with
investigations mostly limited to surface observations. One of three lithic scatter sites on a terrace edge
near Caney Creek, which is often described as an ancestral channel of the Colorado River, contained
Pedernales, Gary, Ensor and Perdiz points as well as ceramics. A recent 48-mile long survey from near
Markham in Matagorda County to near El Campo in Wharton County recorded five historic sites
(41MG131, 41MG132, 41WH97 and 41WH98) all of which were relatively recent farmsteads, and
41MG133, an earthworks feature (Brown et. al 2008). The single recorded prehistoric site, 41WH100,
consisted of three flakes, which given the paucity of such sites in their survey area, was considered to be
of unknown eligibility for National Register status. This site is located within a series of old meander
where the entrenched West Mustang Creek and its tributaries were examined.
Two other prehistoric sites, 41CD86 and 41CD87, have been recorded on Marys Branch about seven
miles east of the eastern end of the transmission line. These sites appear to be lithic scatters with 41CD87
yielding single dart point specimens of Yarbrough and Morhiss types. A common element in prehistoric
site placement appears to be a preference for low ridges or knolls, often sandy, which probably provided,
at minimum, a drainage advantage in the often featureless plains.
Very few other historic period cultural resource sites have been recorded in the project vicinity. Perhaps
the best documented historic site is 41CD115, which was recorded northwest of the current project area
on West Sandy Creek by EH&A during a survey for a proposed Fayette Electric Co-op transmission line.
This site contains the remains of the historic Flournoy family farmstead which appears to date as early as
the mid nineteenth century. Features at the site include the house foundation, a well, cistern, animal pens,
and an orchard. The grave of Sarah Flournoy (1857-1869) is also located within the site boundaries.
Another recorded historic site is the Brown/Axel Cemetery which was recorded by the LCRA Cultural
Resource staff during the T-545 Transmission Line Upgrade Project to the northeast of the project area.
The site is a small family cemetery that contains six graves dating from 1972 to 2005. The cemetery
176

appears to have been established within the transmission line ROW after the line was originally
constructed. The cemetery is fenced and was avoided during the maintenance activities. A Notice of
Existence of Cemetery was filed with the Colorado County Clerk when the presence of the cemetery
became known to the LCRA staff.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND INVESTIGATIVE METHODS

The cultural resource investigations were designed to identify any cultural resources not previously
located and to evaluate the past avoidance that had been recommended for 41CD125 (Kotter 1991). This
was accomplished by a map and literature review to assess the level of previous investigations and to
determine high-probability areas. The previously uninvestigated areas considered to be of high
probability for containing prehistoric archaeological sites were located toward the eastern end of the
project area, at a tributary to Bucksnag Creek and at Pinoak Creek. No high probability historic areas
were recognized. Field work consisted of pedestrian survey and judiciously placed shovel tests. Four
shovel test were excavated within approximately 1,800 feet of high-probability area, a figure somewhat
less than minimum survey standards would suggest (5-6), but an amount considered to be sufficient given
the level of disturbance (rice cultivation and stream channelization) observed especially at the Bucksnag
Creek tributary (see Results section, below). There was no attempt to reassess site 41CD125.
Field orientation was achieved by topographic and aerial maps and aided by GPS navigation. Shovel test
locations were captured on a GPS unit with typical 3-4 m accuracy and recorded on standard shovel test
forms. A no-collection policy was maintained during the field work.

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

Investigations were conducted by a team of three archaeologists during the week of May 14, 2012. No
previously unrecorded sites were identified.
The crossing of the tributary to Bucksnag Creek is located along a county road about 0.2 miles west of
SH 1693. The majority of the transmission line runs through existing rice fields or across a segment of a
crosscutting canal (Figure 91). One narrow strip of relatively intact ground was identified between two
sections of a bend in the canal. A single shovel test was placed at this location. It encountered 6 cm of
recent driftwood, below which, to a depth of 38 cm was a mottled reddish-brown and garish-brown sandy
clay, followed by grayish-brown silt to a depth of 80 cm and pale grayish-brown silty sand to a final
depth of 100 cm. A single fragment of a modern bottle, most likely a medicine bottle for veterinary
purposes, was found in the upper 20 cm. Examination of nearby exposures failed to reveal any other
artifacts.
At Pinoak Creek, about 2 miles west of the Bucksnag Creek crossing, the transmission line followed a
semi-bermed easement that had drainage trenches excavated along either side. Pinoak Creek is quite
narrow at this location and easily crossed on foot. One shovel test was placed on the closest relatively
177

level ground on the west side of the creek and two at similar settings on the east side. These tests were
exacted to depths of 60 to 100 cm and had similar profiles consisting of light grayish-brown fine sandy
loam with iron concretion nodules basically throughout, and increasing with density and mass at deep
elevations. The shovel test on the west side encountered higher clay content than those on the east.
Recovery was limited to single fragment of clear bottle glass.

Figure 91. Location of shovel test T-265-1 at tributary to Bucksnag Creek.

Site 41CD125 was revisited but not reassessed. It was found to be on a low rise just east of a swale
bordering the high terrace of Middle Sandy Creek. After extracting the survey vehicle from the very soft,
very deep sands bordering the creek the site area was examined. A single chert flake in a rodent backdirt
mound confirmed its location. Conversation with the landowner confirmed that no bulldozing had taken
place during original construction of the transmission line, although a brush hog/seppie/Fecon had been
used for clearing. Relatively recent wood chips indicate the corridor has been shredded at least once since
then.
The original site discussion indicates a âmoderate densityâ of chipping debris buried between 30 and 60
cm below the ground surface. A total of 12 pieces of debitage, largely tertiary, was recovered from eight
shovel tests. Although there are few sites in this portion of Colorado County, thus potentially elevating
the research potential of 41CD125, its location in fine sandy soils with clear animal turbation in reality
almost certainly limits any realistic data recovery. So although the present investigations were not
conducted at a level sufficient to make any new recommendations regarding the site, and the previous
recommendations for avoidance will remain in place, future investigations may determine that the site is
not eligible for any formal state or national level recognition.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

LCRA proposes to rebuild an existing 9.4-mile-long transmission line located in southern Colorado
County. New structures may be placed at new locations within the 50-foot-wide ROW, although
previously recommended avoidance measures at 41CD125 will be maintained. Two stream crossings that
had not previously been assessed were field surveyed for archaeological sites, and site 41CD125 was
revisited in order to confirm previous avoidance.
No previously unrecorded archaeological sites were documented as a result of the investigations. Site
41CD125, while possibly overrated in the past, was not reassessed, and avoidance recommendations will
be maintained.
It is therefore recommended that the project be allowed to proceed as described, with the understanding
that standard emergency discovery procedures will be in place.

INTRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

The LCRA is planning to remove small mesquite and ashe juniper (cedar) trees in their Camp Chautauqua
tract (TS-13B) on Lake Travis in Travis County. This tract includes the former Bergstrom Air Force Base
Recreation area and portions of Pace Bend Park that lie to the south (Figure 96). The trees will be cut
down using a Seppi or a skid steer with hydraulic shears. In drainage areas such as creeks, only hand
clearing will be done and cuttings will be carried to upland areas for burning. Mesquite trunks will be
treated with chemicals to prevent regrowth. The project will affect an area covering 153 acres, essentially
all areas of the tract that contain woody vegetation. Most of the project area has been previously
surveyed resulting in the recording of six archeological sites: 41TV968, 41TV971, 41TV972, 41TV974,
41TV1375, and 41TV2286. All these sites were assessed as either not meriting further investigation or
ineligible for State Archeological Landmark (SAL) designation. The THC concurred with these
assessments.
Portions of the former Bergstrom AFB Recreation Area, amounting to 27 acres, have never been surveyed
for cultural resources. Although the tree removal project will use methods that minimize soil
disturbances, the unsurveyed areas could contain archeological deposits and features that might be
impacted by vehicular traffic and other project-related activities. For this reason, the LCRA Cultural
Resources had a small crew of contract archeologists conduct an intensive survey of these areas along
with selective revisits of previously recorded sites that could be impacted by the project. The field survey
took place over three and half days in May, 2012 by a crew of two or three archeologists.
No new sites were located during the survey but the boundaries of five of the previously recorded sites,
41TV968, 41TV971, 41TV972, 41TV1375, and 41TV2286 were expanded. Also, a previously unknown
historic component of 41TV1375 was recorded. It probably represents a 19th century homestead
apparently abandoned before or during the last decade of the 19th century. No intact archeological
deposits relating to this component were found. Archival research might prove productive and this will
be done in conjunction with a future assessment by the LCRA of the cultural resources of Pace Bend.
All the newly recorded site areas do not appear to merit SAL designation except for 41TV1375 which
contains two areas with prehistoric cultural deposits of unknown SAL eligibility. It is recommended that
these areas of 41TV1375 be avoided by all vehicles including skid steers during the upcoming tree
removal project. All trees that need to be removed from these areas will be cut by hand unless a Seppi
can reach in from the existing road. Apart from these restrictions for 41TV1375, it is recommended that
the tree removal project be allowed to proceed. As always, standard emergency procedures will be in
place.
All work was conducted under the terms of and in accordance with LCRAâs annual State Antiquities
Permit Number 6160. There is no federal funding or permitting involved that requires a Section 106
review. Four artifacts collected during the survey, all projectile points, will be curated at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory. The LCRA asks for your concurrence with our assessments and
recommendations.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

The project area is located near the eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau about 30 miles west of the
Balcones Escarpment. The underlying geology consists of Cretaceous Cow creek limestone in the lower
elevations near the valley edge bluffs and Hensell Sand at high elevations to the west (Barnes 1981). The
Cow Creek limestone has a honeycomb appearance due to the dissolved fossils. Weathering over time
creates a complex topography and slope range. The Hensell Sand, composed of sand, silt, clay, and
conglomerate, weathers to a gently rolling to nearly level relief.
As mapped by the Soil Conservation Service (Werchan et al. 1974), the majority of the project area is
covered by Tarrant soils. These are located in a broad band along bluffs on the southeast side of Pace
Bend Park and have developed on the Cow Creek limestone. These soils are shallow with an average of
eight inches of stony clay over bedrock. Limestone boulders cover as much as 50 percent of the surface.
The present field survey encountered deep, very sandy soil in areas where Tarranet soils are mapped.
These sandy soils probably belong to the Pedernales fine sandy loam that is mapped further inland.
Pedernales soils typically develop on old alluvium high on flood plains but at Pace Bend they appear to
correspond with the Hensell Sand formation which is composed in part of friable red sands. Topography
for this formation tends to be gently rolling hills and slopes. Both soils develop under tall grasses with
open tree canopy. Two springs are known at Pace Bend, both located to the west outside the project area.
During the present field survey, small springs or seeps were found in two coves or canyon-like ravines
that enter the limestone shelf from the Colorado River valley on the east. Both springs were flowing at
the time of the survey and both have cypress trees growing near them, suggesting that wet conditions
persist for extended periods.
Nine plant communities or associations have been recognized in Pace Bend Park (Travis County 1996),
three of which occur in the project area: (1) mesquite-plateau live oak savanna, (2) mixed shrubland,

and (3) baldcypress-sycamore woodland. The mesquite-plateau live oak savanna is found in the
western part of the project area where the topography is flatter (Figure 97). Common trees include
mesquite, ashe juniper, and plateau live oak. This plant community might result from previous
use as agricultural fields. The mixed shrubland community is found along the bluff on the
southeast side of the project area. It is basically a plateau live oak-ashe juniper savanna with
brushy species such as Texas colubrine, bluewood condalia, and agarita. The other association,
baldcypress-sycamore woodland, is found along the floor of the narrow canyons that
enter the limestone shelf from the east (Figure 98). This community may have developed at Pace
Bend after the reservoir was created in the 1940s (see Travis County 1996). Besides baldcypress
and sycamore, there is an understory of sedges and buttonbush.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Six archeological sites have been previously recorded in the project area during earlier surveys (EH&A
1985, Kiker 2009) (Figure 99). Preston Millican, an avocational archaeologist and LCRA employee,
recorded archeological sites in the Lake Travis area during 1963/64 (TARL files). One of these sites,
later given the trinomial designation of 41TV169, is located immediately below the full pool of Lake
Travis a short distance outside the northern boundary of the present project area. The site was described
as a shallow rockshelter but it is uncertain if Millican actually saw any artifacts in the shelter. Subsequent
surveys have failed to relocate this shelter and its location as presently plotted may be incorrect.
In 1985, Espey, Huston & Associates conducted a survey of Pace Bend Park for Travis County, who
operate the park, for planning land management (EH&A 1985). Their survey did not include the
Bergstrom AFB Recreation Area. The survey resulted in the recording of 31 sites and 33 isolated finds â
four of these sites - 41TV968, 41TV971, 41TV972, and 41TV974 - are within the current project area.
All the sites were described as lithic scatters with no further recommendations for investigation. The
EH&A did state that one site, 41TV968, might extend into the Bergstrom AFB Recreation Area.
In 1988, an LCRA archeologist conducted a survey for a project named the Bergstrom Recreation Area
Survey Upgrade (TARL files). The exact area covered by the survey is not known but it did result in the
recording of one site, 41TV1375, containing scattered burned rock, debitage, tested cobbles, and one
uniface. Most of these artifacts were seen in a dirt road that bisected the site. A garbage dump with car
parts was also noted. Although the archeologist had stated that the site had been almost completely
destroyed by bulldozing, he also recommended that care be taken in this area if construction is planned,
implying the possibility of intact cultural deposits.
LCRA archeologists conducted another survey within the former Recreation Area in 2008 for the Oak
Wilt Remediation and Containment Project (Kiker 2009). The survey resulted in the recording of one
new site, 41TV2286, a shallowly buried lithic scatter. Efforts were also made to relocate 41TV169 and
41TV966 which lies just outside the present project area, both apparently destroyed by road construction
and wave action, respectively.

METHODOLOGY
An intensive cultural resources survey was conducted in those portions of the project area which had
never been previously investigated (see Figure 99). These areas mostly lay within the south half of the
former Bergstrom AFB Recreation Area but also included small areas in the northeast and northwest
corners. These previously unsurveyed areas total 27 acres.
Because of the thick brush covering most of the unsurveyed portions of the Recreation area, transects
were walked in a zigzag fashion by a two to three person crew at 10 to 20 meter intervals. These transects
were usually started from open areas such as old roads and clearings along fencelines. Ground

visibility was generally poor and shovel tests were placed to sample all areas where soil depth was more
than a few centimeters. Shovel probes were used to test the soil depth before attempting to dig a formal
shovel test. Shovel testing was also used to ascertain the limits of sites. All non-diagnostic artifacts
recovered from these tests were returned to their respective hole during refilling. A projectile point
fragment recovered from one test at 41TV971 was collected for curation.
Also, previously recorded sites along the river south of the formal Recreation Area were revisited with
additional shovel testing done in areas with deep soil. Sites 41TV968, 41TV971, and 41TV972, were
relocated and their boundaries recorded using a GPS unit. For 41TV971, shovel tests were placed in
areas with deep soil to determine buried artifact density and depth. Site 41TV974 was not revisited.
Thirty-two tests were placed in the 27-acre previously unsurveyed area and three more tests within
41TV971, located in the southeast corner of the project area, for a project total of 35 tests (see appendix).
Each test was a circular hole approximately 35 cm in diameter and dug in 20 cm levels down to bedrock
in most cases. Because the entire project area lies within uplands, cultural material was expected to be
shallowly buried, generally not more that 40 cm. In nearly all the shovel tests, bedrock was encountered
above 40 cm. In a few areas deeper sandy soils were present that contained cultural material. In such
cases, the tests were dug to bedrock in order to learn the depth of the cultural deposits. In one case, the
test was ended when the top of a burned rock cluster was encountered so as not to further damage the
feature.
Four projectile points, including the one from the 41TV971 shovel test, were collected during the field
survey and will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL).

RESULTS

No new sites were recorded during the survey but the boundaries of five previously recorded sites,
41TV968, 41TV971, 41TV972, 41TV1375, and 41TV2286, were expanded. Additional data collected
during this survey has led to a change in site type classification from lithic scatter to prehistoric campsite
for 41TV968, 41TV971, and 41TV2286. Site 41TV1375 was also found to have heretofore unknown
historic component, a nineteenth century homestead.
41TV968
This site was originally recorded a short distance south of the Bergstrom Recreation Area by
archeologists from Espey, Huston & Associates during the 1985 survey of Pace Bend Park (Figure 101).
They described the site as a prehistoric lithic scatter covering a 40 by 45 meter area based on the surface
distribution of artifacts. Only one flake was recovered from two shovel tests, indicating a low density of
buried cultural material. Surface artifacts consisted primarily of tertiary chert debitage. A Fairland point,
a style dating to the end of the Late Archaic, a proximal biface fragment, and an edge-modified flake were
collected. The recorded felt that the site probably continued to the north into the Bergstrom AFB
Recreation Area.

The present survey found that the site does in fact continue into the former Recreation Area, occupying
most of the ridge that runs in a southwest to northeast direction. The ridge is bordered by the steep valley
edge or bluffs of the Colorado River on the southeast (often inundated when Lake Travis is at full pool)
and the canyon-like ravine on the north and northwest sides. A small flowing spring emerges from the
ravine about 50 meters north of the site where a large cypress tree stands. A low stone wall of unknown
age â it could have been constructed during the Bergstrom period â runs along the northeast end of the
ridge.
The site area was probably once a grassland with scattered live oak trees but decades of intensive clearing
followed by abandonment has resulted in a dense cover of brush and small trees, including ashe juniper,
mesquite, persimmon, bluewood condalia, prickly pear, and tasajillo. Moderate-sized live oaks are
present. Soils are shallow, consisting of brown stony clayey loams over limestone bedrock with frequent
rock outcrops. The lower slopes of the ridge seem to be particularly rocky.
A light surface scatter of chert debitage, burned rock, and mussel shell was seen on the spine of the ridge
east of old Recreation Area fence. One medial biface fragment and a granite mano were also observed.
Some of this material was probably exposed by bulldozing, signs of which are common on the ridge.
Shovel testing found moderate amounts of buried debitage in shallow soil across a 50-x-50-meter area.
The original site area west of the fence was also visited. A light scatter of debitage was observed along
with a few pieces of burned rock.
Although this site consists mostly of a light lithic scatter, there are areas with evidence of cooking
activities in the form of burned rock and mussel shells. However, these types of artifacts are sparse. The
research value of this site is probably low since intact features and unmixed artifacts are unlikely to be
found in the shallow rocky soils on the ridge. The site does demonstrate that sporadic camping took place
on the ridge but other nearby areas, such as 41TV1875 north of the spring, were probably more desirable
locales for camping. Because of the steep descent to the Colorado River on the east side of the site, the
spring to the west was probably the main source of water.

41TV971
When first recorded by EH&A in 1985, this site was described as a prehistoric lithic scatter consisting
mostly of debitage with one Ensor-like point, probably dating to the Late Archaic II period (see Johnson
and Goode 1994). However, their shovel testing did recover a small amount of burned rock and mussel
shell in the shallow soils so at least some camping activities took place here. No further investigation was
recommended. This site was relocated during the present survey and found to cover about the same sized
area as EH&A reported, that is, about 160-x-200 meters. The present survey also located an area at the
north end of the site that contains somewhat deeper sandy soil with buried cultural material.
The site is located on a low slope south of small ravine in the bedrock that forms cove when the lake is
full (Figure 102). Within the ravine is a small spring that was barely flowing at the time of the present
survey. One mature cypress and many small sycamores grow along the base of the ravine downstream
from the spring. Upslope, cedar trees are dominant with grassy clearings to the north where soils are
194

sandy and to the southeast close to the valley edge the terrain is open and rocky. It is in these more open
areas where most of the surface artifacts were seen. The area of thick cedar woods that cover the upper
slope was not surveyed during the present project but their inclusion within the site area seems
reasonable.
Most of the surface artifacts were seen in the southeast site area where ground visibility was best. These
consisted mostly of debitage with a few cores and one Pedernales point (Figure 103), a type which dates
to the Late Archaic I period, and a burned sandstone metate fragment. Another burned sandstone metate
fragment was observed at the north end of the site where soils appeared deep. A shovel test placed near
this artifact reached a depth of only 32 cm before encountering limestone bedrock. The distal tip of a
beveled edged point (Darl?) was recovered from the bottom of this test. Two other tests placed in the area
recovered a few pieces of debitage each and in one test a small fragment of burned rock. Bedrock was
struck at between 14 and 45 cm. The shovel testing shows that soils in the northern site area are not
particularly deep and that artifact density is low. The findings of the present survey do not alter EH&Aâs
assessment that the site does not merit further investigation.

41TV972
EH&A archeologists originally described this site as a prehistoric lithic scatter covering a 20-x-20 meter
area. Their report (EH&A 1985) states that the site is located on a bluff overlooking the Colorado River
but their map in the Appendix shows it at least 100 meters west of the bluffs. The present survey did
locate a lithic scatter in the general area as plotted and it is presumed this is what EH&A recorded in
1985. Although EH&A noted a biface fragment and two cores in addition to debitage, the present survey
only found debitage in a 20 meter-wide area running 50 meters east to west. They recommended no
further investigation of the site.
Fifty meters to the east, a second lithic scatter was located during the present survey. It consisted of two
flakes and the stem of an Ensor point. On the site map of 41TV972 in Figure 102, this scatter is
designated as Area B while the first (and larger) scatter is designated Area A. Both scatters occur in open
areas where limestone cobbles are exposed on the surface and where visibility is good due to sparse
ground vegetation. An old stone wall lies 50 meters to the northeast of Area B. It is 220 feet in length,
running in a linear northwest to southeast direction and ending about 10 feet from the bluff edge. It
stands five or more courses in places, built of large limestone boulders.

41TV1375
This site was originally recorded in 1988 by an LCRA archeologist for an upgrade project. The
archeologist noted burned rocks and lithics in an old bulldozed area with dirt piles. Also noted were car
parts and other trash. The present survey relocated this disturbed area near where the site is plotted on the
THCâs Sites Atlas. The current survey also found a historic component that probably represents a 19th
century homestead.

Figure 103. Pedernales point from 41TV971.

The site is situated on a slope facing southeast toward the ravine where a spring emerges (Figure 104).
The location of the spring is marked by a tall cypress tree. Vegetation on the slope includes scattered live
oak trees and mottes, along with brushy species such as persimmon, ashe juniper, and cedar. Prickly Pear
and tasajillo cactus are common. Deep sandy soil occurs west of the old dirt road that runs north to south
through the site. The upslope edge of the road has cut into the slope exposing a scattering of historic and
prehistoric artifacts. West of the road lies a 30-x-40-meter area of old dirt piles, possible borrow pits, and
uneven ground in general â these are the disturbances mentioned by the original recorder. Other more
extensive areas to the north looked scraped and the dirt piles may be push piles. Despite all this
destruction, at least two small isolated areas appear intact. One of these is in a grove of persimmon trees
west of two posts on the dirt road, the other immediately north of a gully at the south end of the site (see
Figure 104).

Prehistoric Component
This component consists of a light to moderate scatter of lithics, groundstone, and burned rocks covering
nearly two acres. In addition, there is at least one buried burned rock feature that could be a hearth. The
site is bisected north to south by an old dirt road with the densest cultural deposits to the west where deep
sandy soils are present, while to the east the soils are shallow with frequent low rock outcrops. While the
area west of the road has been severely disturbed by bulldozing, some areas appear to have intact soil. In
one of these intact areas, buried prehistoric cultural material was recovered from between 20 to 70 cm
below surface in ST 12. In another shovel test, ST28, a possible rock hearth was encountered at 31 cm

197

below surface (Figure 105). These intact areas cover approximately 0.2 acre and represent about 10
percent of the site. The only prehistoric diagnostic artifact found during the current survey was a Perdiz
arrow point (AD 1300 to 1650) collected from the southeast corner of the site area.

Historic component
A historic component of 41TV1375 was recognized during the present survey. Nearly all historic material
is contained within the northwest quadrant of the prehistoric component area. It consists of three piles of
boulder-sized rocks, smaller groupings of boulders, and a surface scatter of domestic trash debris. When
historic artifacts were first noticed in the road cut, a 1930 USGS topographic map (USGS Spicewood
1:62,500) was consulted to if a house was depicted at that location. No house was shown on the topo map
and subsequent investigations of the site during the present survey may explain why. The artifact
assemblage as a whole suggests an end date to the occupancy no later than the period between 1890 and
1900. The site could have been abandoned even earlier. By the time of the 1930 USGS survey, the house
apparently was no longer standing.
The three rock piles, designated F1, F2, and F3, are located under a grove of persimmon trees west of the
dirt road in the northern area with intact prehistoric deposits. FI consists of about 30 limestone boulders
with a slight depression in the ground measuring 10 feet north to south and slightly less east to west. F2
is located about 30 feet south of F1 (Figure 106). It is a pile of limestone boulders, some of which look
roughly shaped by percussion, measuring about 5-x-8 feet. F3 is about six feet east of F2 and is roughly
circular in plan. None of these features seems to represent a chimney fall and it remains uncertain what
they were used for or if they are even near their original locations. Some of the larger stones could
represent pier stones. The two shovel tests placed near these features, ST12 and ST130, recovered no
historic artifacts. No historic artifacts were seen on the surface in close association with these features.

Figure 105. Possible hearth in shovel test 28.
199

Artifacts noted on the surface or recovered from the upper 20 cm of two shovel tests include amber, aqua,
and black bottle glass, window glass, whiteware, yellowware, and salt glaze stoneware sherds, cut nails, a
rivet, and cast iron fragments. The absence of purple glass suggests that use of cheap bottles at the site
ended around 1890 (Lindsey 2012). The applied aqua bottle finish (opening) suggests a pre-1890s date as
does the black bottle glass fragemnt. Cut nails were gradually replaced by wire nails between 1890 and
1900 but often recycled.
Shovel test 14 placed south of the rock pile features encountered a series of horizontal posts or branches
resting at about 25 cm (Figure 107). The deposits above appeared disturbed and contained a relatively
high density of historic artifacts and a few prehistoric artifacts. These posts or limbs may have been
pushed flat by heavy machinery and then covered by layer of earth fill. About 10 feet to the southwest is
a large earth pile partially covering a completely rusted automobile.
No intact cultural deposits belonging to the historic component were found during the survey. The exact
location of the house site is in doubt, although it must have been in the immediate vicinity, and its
remains were destroyed by bulldozing that occurred well in the past. For this reason, the historic
component is not considered SAL-eligible.

41TV2286
This site was first recorded during a 2008 oak wilt control project (Kiker 2009). A small number of
flakes were found on the surface and recovered from a few shovel tests within a 0.7 acre area. The site
was assessed as ineligible for SAL designation, which the THC concurred with and the project proceeded.
The present survey has extended the siteâs boundary southwards to the summit of a hill that overlooks the
Colorado River (Figure 108). While in 2008, the investigators found only debitage, the area on the hilltop
also has some burned rock, groundstone, and mussel shell. This cultural material, along with recent
hardware (screws and metal nuts), was recovered from shovel tests placed in thin pockets of soil
surrounded by a network of old gravel roads built by Bergstrom AFB. These deposits clearly show that
some prehistoric cooking took place on the hill, but because they are shallow and disturbed they do not
appear to be eligible for SAL designation.
SUMMARY

No new sites were located during the survey but the boundaries of five previously recorded sites,
41TV968, 41TV971, 41TV972, 41TV1375, and 41TV2286, were expanded and the classification of three
of these, 41TV968, 41TV971, and 41TV2286, changed from lithic scatter to campsite based on the
presence of burned rock and food remains (mussel shell). Also, a previously unknown historic
component of 41TV1375 was rerecorded. It probably represents a nineteenth century homestead
apparently

abandoned before or during the last decade of the nineteenth century. The homestead and three of the
prehistoric campsites are located in proximity to small springs or seeps that emerge from two small
canyons on the east side of the project area. While the baldcypress-sycamore-woodland plant
community of these canyons is thought to be of recent origin - developing after the impoundment of the
lake â the proximity of prehistoric campsites and a 19th century homestead suggests that the springs have
existed for some time. Still, accumulation of prehistoric burned rock and mussel shell is slight which
suggests that prehistoric occupation was sporadic perhaps because these springs flowed intermittently.

RECOMMENDATIONS

Four sites in the project area, 41TV968, 41TV971, 41TV972, and 41TV2286, do not appear to be eligible
for formal designation as SALs. The newly recorded areas of 41TV968 and 41TV2286 have been
severely disturbed by land clearing and road construction associated with the former Bergstrom AFB
Recreation Area. Sites 41TV971 and 41TV972 were previously assessed by EH&A as not significant
with THC concurrence. The findings of the present survey do not change these assessments.
One site in the project area, 41TV1375, does have prehistoric deposits of unknown SAL eligibility.
These are found in two small areas of intact soil where buried prehistoric cultural material, including one
burned rock feature, is located. Further investigation, perhaps including test pits, would be needed to
determine if these buried deposits are eligible for SAL status. The historic component of 41TV1375 has
been destroyed by bulldozing that occurred in the distant past.
It is recommended that both these potentially significant areas of 41TV1375, referred to here as Area 1
and Area 2, be avoided by all vehicles including skid steers during the upcoming tree removal project
(Figure 109). All trees that need to be removed from these areas should be cut by hand unless a Seppi can
reach in from the existing road. These avoidance areas are shown in Figure 109. Area 1 (about 700 m2)
lies in a grove of persimmon trees adjacent to the west side of the road starting south of two wooden posts
on either side of the road. Area 2 (about 300 m2) also lies adjacent to the west of the road 120 feet south
of Area 1. It is bordered on the south by a deep gully.
Apart from these restrictions for 41TV1375, it is recommended that the tree removal project be allowed to
proceed. As always, standard emergency procedures will be in place.

INTRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) is planning to clear brush in a portion of its Cedar Point
Recreation Area on Lake Buchanan in Llano County. The clearing will occur on 72 acres located in the
northwestern part of the park, one of the few areas on this property which has not been intensively
surveyed for cultural resources (Figure 110). This area has not seen much development except for park
roads, thus retaining the character of its former use as cattle range. Brush, as well as dead trees, will be
cut either by using a Seppi or by hand with chainsaws and loppers. While ground disturbances will be
kept to a minimum, surface and near-surface cultural deposits might be impacted by the project.
Two archeological sites have already been recorded within the project area: 41LL354, a historic house
site and prehistoric lithic scatter recorded during a 1979 LCRA brush clearing project (Prewitt and Kotter
1980), and 41LL442, a prehistoric campsite recorded during an LCRA fence replacement project (Malof
et al. 2004). Both sites were considered potentially significant and recommended for testing if avoidance
was not possible.
The field survey was done during June, 2012 by contacted archeologists working for the LCRA. The
survey was restricted to those parts of the project area that are thought to have a high potential for
prehistoric sites because of their proximity to streams. These high-probability areas cover about 40 acres
or 56 percent of the entire project area. During the survey, two new archeological sites, 41LL564 and
41LL565, were recorded and the two previously recorded sites, 41LL354 and 41LL442, were revisited.
The two new sites are light prehistoric lithic scatters and are not considered eligible for State
Archeological Landmark (SAL) designation. Site 41LL442, the previously recorded prehistoric campsite,
is assessed as ineligible for SAL designation because of disturbances to the shallow cultural deposits.
The prehistoric component of 41LL354 within the project area is sparse and confined to the surface; it is
not considered SAL-eligible. The historic component contains scattered boulders thought to be the
remains of a house with an artifact scatter dating to the 1890 to 1920 period. Archival research done for
the project found that the original owner of the property was Alonzo Cowan, the former slave of David
Cowan, the first Anglo American settler in what would become Llano County. However, it does not
appear that Alonzo Cowan ever lived on the property and the house there belonged to later Anglo
American owners or tenants. The disturbed condition of the historic remains and their lack of historical
significance make them ineligible for SAL designation.
Based on the results of the investigation, the LCRA recommends that the proposed brush clearing be
allowed to proceed without restrictions. All work was conducted under the terms of and in accordance
with LCRAâs annual State Antiquities Permit Number 6160. There is no Federal funding or permitting
involved that requires a Section 106 review. Three artifacts collected during the survey, two projectile
points and a cap and ball revolver hammer, will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory.

GEOLOGY AND SOILS

The surface geology of most of the project area consists of Town Mountain granite of Precambrian age
(Barnes 1983). Low outcrops of consolidated granite occur west of Cowan Creek on the east side of the
project area. However, much of the surface granite has weathered into grus (decomposing granite), which
in turn has eroded into low hills inclining northeastwards toward the Colorado River channel. On the
western edge of the project area an ancient fault line separates this granite from the younger Hickory
sandstone of Cambrian age. The fault line is marked by a long escarpment which, while not particularly
high, forms one of the most prominent topographic features in the western half of the park. It drops
steeply to west toward low-lying land outside the project area.
Three soil map units have been identified in the project area: Lou coarse sandy loam, Keese coarse sandy
loam, and Nebgen-Rock outcrop complex (Goerdel 2000). Lou soils form on low slopes in areas
underlain by granite. They are the most extensive as well as the deepest of the three soils, with surface
and subsurface zones combining for a thickness of 30 cm and another 65 cm of reddish-brown or red
subsoil above the granite grus. Keese soils, which also form on granite, are located on ridgetops and
slopes, and are comparatively shallow with a thickness of 40 cm. The Nebgen soils are shallower still,
with 28 cm of dark brown sandy loam over indurated (hardened) sandstone bedrock. Typically, this
mapping unit consists of 14 percent rock outcrop. The current survey observed frequent sandstone
outcrops along the top and slope of the escarpment at the west end of the project area.

HISTORIC BACKGROUND

The project area lies about two miles west of Maxwells Slough on Lake Buchanan, a large inlet on the
southeast edge of the Cedar Point Recreation Area. This area, now inundated by the lake, was the site of
the earliest Anglo-American settlement in what would become Llano County (Yarbrough 1990). In 1850,
David Cowan, a land surveyor, established a salt making enterprise at a salt springs on the west side of
the Colorado River. The community that grew up around the springs became known as Colorado Saline.
It was the de facto county seat when Llano became a county in 1856. At its peak, the saltworks had 26
iron kettles in operation where brine from the salt springs was boiled to produce salt. Each kettle held
250 gallons of saline (Yarbrough 1990).
Billy Davis was another early pioneer who established his homestead on the west side of the Colorado
River within a major bend of the river southeast of Colorado Saline. This area became an early focal point
of settlement, and the site of a gristmill. By 1859, this settlement became known as Bluffton, apparently
given the name by Ike Maxwell, one of the early settlers who was originally from Bluffton, Arkansas
(Yarbrough 1990). The town grew to include a hotel, a blacksmith shop, a cotton gin, and saloons. An
1883 fire destroyed most of the town and it was rebuilt about a half mile to the south on the main road
between Burnet and Llano. In the 1930s, plans to create a reservoir, later named Lake Buchanan,
required that Bluffton move to another site, its third, five miles to the west.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

Prewitt & Associates archeologists surveyed the entire Cedar Point Park in 1979. The survey was not
intensive and as was routine at the time, no subsurface testing was done (Prewitt and Kotter 1980). They
recorded one archeological site, 41LL354, within the current project area (Figure 111). Two components
were recognized at this site; a historic component representing a late nineteenth century homestead and a
prehistoric component consisting of a light lithic scatter. Avoidance of the historic house site, containing
stone piers, was recommended.
The area along the south edge of the current project area was surveyed in 2002 for an LCRA fence
replacement project (Malof et al. 2004). A prehistoric campsite, 41LL442, was recorded near the western
edge of the park (see Figure 111). Surface finds included several bifaces, cores, a Darl point, and a
metate fragment; all were observed in gopher backdirt piles. Considering the number of stone tools,
surprisingly little debitage was noted. Because buried material seemed to be present, the site was
considered potentially significant and avoidance was recommended.
Site 41LL354 was also revisited during the 2002 fence project. Shovel testing found sparse historic glass,
ceramics, and metal in the upper 20 cm of soil near the house piers. Fairly dense buried debitage was
recovered from testing closer to Cowan Creek to the east outside the current project area.

METHODOLOGY

A file search showed that two sites, 41LL354 and 42LL442, had already been recorded in the project area
(see Figure 111). Both sites were assessed as potentially significant, although neither site was shovel
tested, and the significance of the buried cultural deposits is unknown. Therefore, part of the field
investigations included revisiting these sites, excavating shovel tests to determine depth of buried
deposits, and reassessing their significance in light of their present condition.
Another purpose of the field investigation was to locate any previously unrecorded archeological sites
within the project area and assess their potential for SAL designation. The field investigations involved
first identifying those areas within the proposed brush clearing project which have a high probability for
archeological sites and conducting an intensive field survey of those areas. For this project, highprobability areas were defined as those areas within 200 meters of a stream. Two high-probability areas
were identified: one at the east end of the project area on the west side of Cowan Creek and one on the
projectâs west side through which an unnamed intermittent creek runs. The eastern high-probability area
covers 10.6 acres and the western high-probability area covers 28.1 acres for a total of 38.7 acres
surveyed.
The survey consisted of walking transects at roughly 20 meter intervals and inspecting the ground surface
for cultural material. Shovel tests were placed in areas where soil appeared deep, as well as to find the
limits of archeological sites. Because of the nature of the gravelly granitic soils, archeological sites tend

to become buried even on non-aggrading landforms leaving little surface evidence (Hixson 2010).
Therefore, shovel tests were placed near all isolated artifacts encountered on the surface. In all, 34 shovel
tests were dug during the survey (Figure 112, Appendix 1). Since no alluvium is present in the project
area, shovel tests were dug only to the clayey B horizon if bedrock was not encountered first. Each
shovel test was a circular hole 35 cm in diameter dug in 20 cm levels, and all fill was screened through a
one-quarter-inch mesh. Artifact recovery was analyzed in the field and returned to the hole when
refilling. All prehistoric diagnostic artifacts recovered from the shovel testing were collected for curation;
for this project only one such artifact was recovered, an untyped dart point from ST 19. Surface
diagnostic artifacts were also collected for curation: these amounted to one dart point and the hammer of a
percussion cap revolver.
Archeological sites were mapped using a GPS unit to record shovel test locations as waypoints, which
were later projected onto aerial maps for this report. For the historic component of 41LL354 - the only
site with cultural features - a map drawing was made using the pace and compass method.

RESULTS

Two new archeological sites, 41LL564 and 41LL565, were recorded during the survey (Figure 113, also
see Figure 112). Both are prehistoric lithic scatters located on the west side of the project area. The two
previously recorded sites, 41LL354 and 41LL442, were revisited and their significance reassessed.

41LL564
Site 41LL564 is a prehistoric lithic scatter located on the east side of the unnamed stream that runs
through the west side of Cedar Point (Figure 114). It lies across the creek from 41LL442. The site
consists of two areas of artifact concentration: Area A is located on the south side of a low hill and Area
B located close to the creek to the west. Between the two artifact areas runs an old road bed with ditches
along either side (Figure 115). This road appears to follow the same path as one depicted in the 1909 and
1925 USGS topographic maps. Construction of the road has probably destroyed the central part of the
site. Other major disturbances were caused by the clearing of corridors for two electrical distribution
lines. The local plant community consists of live oak mesquite savanna with an understory of whitebrush
and cactus. Only one artifact, a flake, was seen on the ground in Area A. A shovel test (9) placed near
this find recovered a large amount of lithics, mostly in the upper 20 cm of soil with smaller amounts
down to 47 cm where granite grus was encountered. In all, 24 pieces of chert debitage and one thin (stage
3) biface were recovered from this test. Shovel tests placed 30 m to the north and east recovered only a
few pieces of lithics apiece. The other shovels placed in Area A recovered no artifacts.
A long, narrow, heavily patinated dart point was collected from the surface of Area B (Figure 116). It
appears to have once been a wider point, possibly a Bulverde type, that has had its lateral edges reworked
considerably creating a lanceolate shape. A shovel test (19) placed near this find recovered five pieces of
debitage in shallow soil. Three other shovel tests placed in Area B had little or no recovery.

The cultural deposits at 41LL564 consist of low to moderate densities of debitage and a few stone tools,
probably representing repeated but short-term visits to the area to conduct specific tasks. The material is
presumed mixed because it occurs on a non-aggrading landform. The cultural deposits appear to have
little research value, and the site is not considered eligible for SAL designation.

219

41LL565
Site 41LL565 is a lithic scatter located at the northwest corner of the park south of the rocky peninsula
known a Cedar Point (Figure 117). The ground rises slowly toward the south and is covered by savanna
vegetation dominated by mesquite and oak trees. Tree canopy coverage increases toward south and west.
A gravel park road runs through the east end of the site. The cleared corridor for an electrical distribution
line runs northeast to southwest through the site area and a second cleared corridor runs along its southern
edge.
Few artifacts were visible on the surface but then ground visibility was poor at the time of the survey due
to knee-high herbaceous plants. Nearly all the artifacts found at this site were recovered through shovel
testing. These artifacts consist almost entirely of debitage although one untyped dart point was recovered
in shovel test 17 (Figure 118). Recovery ranged from two to four artifacts for each shovel test with no
particular concentration either horizontally or vertically across the site.
In type of materials and setting, this site is similar to 41LL564, and for similar reasons â lack of features,
mixed deposits - is not considered eligible for SAL designation. The site does extend to the north and
northwest outside the project area and the significance of the archeological deposits in those areas
remains unknown.

41LL354 (revisit)
This archeological site contains both prehistoric and historic components. The historic component
consists of a former house site and associated scatter of historic artifacts (Figure 119). The house site,
marked by what appears to be scattered pier stones, is located on the west (left) side of Cowan Creek
about 50 feet north of RR 3014. The old road to Tow ran about 480 feet north of the house site. This
road is shown on the both the 1909 and 1925 USGS topographic maps and can be seen on modern aerial
photos; west of Cowan Creek, its path runs parallel to and 600 feet north of FM 3014.
This site was first recorded by Prewitt & Associates archeologists during 1979 LCRA brush control
project. They found several pier-sized rocks laid side by side and an associated artifact scatter consisting
of a cut nail, glass, whiteware, and rock rubble. A very light debitage scatter was also present which
included a flaked piece of glass or obsidian.
When the house site was revisited during the present survey, seven limestone boulders were noted apparently the piers-sized rocks seen in 1979 â now without any discernible alignment; they looked like
they had been pushed up there by a bulldozer (Figure 120). The rocks all appeared to be limestone.
While blocky in shape, they show no obvious signs modification. The largest stone was 75 by 25 by 20
cm. There was also a scatter of smaller rocks that appeared burned.

220

221

Figure 118. Untyped projectile point from Shovel Test 17 at 41LL565.

Not enough rocks are present to represent chimney fall. No well or cistern were seen, and the closest
water being Cowan Creek 500 feet to the south. Old brush piles in the form of brush-covered mounds are
present over much of the site area.
The most common time-sensitive artifact is purple bottle glass, with slightly less aqua, amber, milk, and
clear glass. There were also a few pieces of âblackâ or very dark green glass. There were several dozen
whiteware sherds, many appearing thicker than those usually seen at historic sites in the region. Very few
were decorated; these included one green-transfer ware and a possible hand painted sherd. There were a
few sherds of Albany slip glazed stoneware. Metal artifacts included cut nails, cast iron fragments, a
percussion cap revolver hammer (Figure 121), a horseshoe nail, and a buckle. The revolver hammer was
collected for curation. Some modern trash was also present.
The house appears to be shown on the 1909 USGS topographic map, Burnet quad, but this is far from
clear. It is definitely not shown on the 1925 USGS map, Tow quad. The presence of purple glass
suggests that the house was being occupied sometime between 1890 and 1920. The black glass could
mean the site was occupied as early as the 1880s, or even earlier. Cut nails suggest a construction date
before 1900 but then nails were often recycled.
The house is located in the northwest corner of the Alonzo Cowan survey, a 160 acre preemption land
grant awarded to Alonzo Cowan, a former slave of David Cowan, the surveyor who established the
saltworks at Colorado Saline (Russell 2011, see Appendix 2). Alonzo Cowan owned the property for ten
years, selling it to a J. W. Robinson in 1887 (see Appendix 2). There is no documentary evidence that
Alonzo Cowan ever lived on the property, and the artifact assemblage of the 41LL354 house site appears
to postdate his ownership of the property. The house was probably lived in (and possibly built) by later
Anglo American owners or tenants (see Appendix 2). Because of the condition of the historic deposits
and the lack of historical significance or unique attributes, the historic component is not considered SALeligible.

41LL442 (revisit)
This is a prehistoric campsite located near the western edge of the park on the west side of an unnamed
intermittent or ephemeral creek (Figure 122). Comparing the recent aerial to the 1979 USGS topographic
map shows that RR 3014 once ran through the site. Sometime after 1979, this section of the highway was
moved about 130 feet to the south. The only signs of this road in the site area are the two ditches that
once lay on either side of the old highway. These now resemble gullies and were recorded as such during
the 2002 survey. It appears that the constructions of this road and its replacement have destroyed a large
part of the site.
More cultural material seemed to have been present on the surface when the site was first recorded in
2002. At that time several bifaces, a Darl point, and a metate were noted on the surface along with about
a dozen pieces of debitage (Malof et al. 2004). Only the Darl point was collected. When the site was
revisited for this project, only a few chert flakes were seen on the surface and no tools. A few scattered
burned rocks might be present on the surface but these are hard to identify with certainty.
Shovel testing shows that most of the site area has thin soil containing little cultural material. The
exception is a small wedge-shaped area adjacent to the highway ROW where a shovel test (2) recovered
17 pieces of debitage in the upper 40 cm of soil along with modern bottle glass, and four more pieces
from 40 to 58 cm. Below this, the test encountered granite grus. Although this site was originally
assessed as potentially significant, the current investigation has shown that highway construction has
destroyed most of this site with one small area of possibly intact soil adjacent to present Highway ROW.
This area was shovel tested and found to contain moderate amounts of debitage mostly mixed with
modern trash. Other possibly intact soil on the north side of the site area is shallow and nearly devoid of
cultural material. Because of the disturbances and shallow soil, 41LL442 does not meet the requirements
for SAL designation.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Both the new sites recorded during this project, 41LL564 and 41LL565, are upland lithic scatters that do
not appear to meet the requirements for SAL designation. Site 41LL442, a previously recorded
prehistoric campsite, was reassessed as not meeting the requirements for SAL status because of
disturbances and shallow cultural deposits. The prehistoric component of 41LL354 within the current
project area contains only sparse debitage and does not meet the requirements for SAL designation. The
SAL eligibility of the prehistoric component of this site to the south and east outside the project area
remains unknown.
The property where 41LL354 is located has an interesting history of ownership. Alonzo Cowan, a former
slave, acquired the property in 1877 as a preemption grant, and he was the only African American to have
a Llano County land survey in his name. He came to the area west of the Colorado River with his owner,
David Cowan, in the early 1850s and probably worked at the Colorado Saline saltworks. However, the
artifact assemblage around the 41LL354 house site suggests it was occupied after Alonzo Cowan sold the
226

property in 1887. The only direct physical evidence of the house is a group of scattered boulders
presumed to be pier stones. Because of the disturbed condition of the 41LL354 historic component, it is
not considered eligible for SAL designation.
Because no SAL-eligible archeological sites are located in the project area, the brush clearing should be
allowed to proceed as planned. As always, standard emergency procedures will be in place.

APPENDIX 2.
41LL354 Historical Background
By Dan Utley
The historic component of site 41LL354 is situated within a 160-acre tract patented to Alonzo Cowan. A
freedman born in Tennessee c. 1843, Cowan is believed to have been brought to Texas in the early 1850s
as a slave owned by David Cowan, who operated an important salt works in the Bluffton-Tow area.
Although Alonzo (Lon) Cowan remained in Texas following the end of the Civil War and the advent of
emancipation, the 1870 federal census shows him living in nearby San Saba County with his wife Julia
(shown as Judia in land records) and their children: Winnie (age 13), Benjamin (9), George (7), and
Jefferson (3). (U.S. Census Bureau: 1870; Russell 2011).
The Cowan family was back in Llano County shortly after, as Alonzo received the patent in 1877. He
filed an affidavit petitioning for the land in December of the previous year and acquired it as part of an
1873 act designed for the âbenefit of actual occupants of the public lands.â (Llano County Deed Records:
B/390) Because the law did not provide enforcement of any minimal dimensions for a livable habitat,
many such patents went to residents who made only minimal improvements on the land, if at all. There is
no reason to believe however that Cowan was not compliant with the letter of the law, but there is also no
confirmation within available records that he resided at what is now 41LL354. If such evidence existed, it
was likely lost in the 1880 courthouse fire that destroyed many of the early land records dating from the
countyâs founding in 1856.
Records from around the time of the patent and those filed many years later provide some possible clues
about where Alonzo Cowan may have made his home. His former owner, David Calvin Cowan, died in
1878. Two years later, the probate court ordered the sale of 15.25 acres of the Conrad Pape Survey to pay
off debts of the estate, and the purchaser was Alonzo Cowan, who paid two dollars an acre. (Llano
County Deed Records: B/391) In 1930, resident I.B. Maxwell, 93 years old at the time, filed affidavits
relative to the David Cowan family heirship. He stated that he had known David Cowan since 1854 and
that the salt works operator had lived all that time on the Conrad Pape property. He also stated that in
1875, some parties whose names he could not recall had brought suit against Cowan for possession of the
property. The district court ultimately found in favor of defendant Cowan, thereby âquieting the title of
said survey.â Records of that case, however, were lost in the 1880 fire, so there is no evidence that the
litigants might have included Alonzo Cowan. Regardless, it is known that the freedman ended up with at
least a part of his former ownerâs estate. (Llano County Deed Records: C/324 and 62/325)
Alonzo Cowanâs abstract consisted of acreage not previously settled under the terms of the Fisher-Miller
Land Grant. The Republic of Texas approved the colonization petition of Henry Francis Fisher, Burchard
Miller, and Joseph Baker in 1842 that called for the settlement of 1,000 (later 6,000) European families
from Holland, Switzerland, Germany, Norway, and other countries on several million acres between the
Colorado and Llano rivers. Fisher and Miller sold their rights in 1845 without fulfilling the contract, and
overall administration then transferred to the Adelsverein (also known as the Society for Protection of
German Immigrants in Texas), which proved instrumental in the development of such settlements as
Fredericksburg and New Braunfels. The Adelsverein took over the land previously administered by the
232

San Saba Colonization Company, including parts of what are now Llano and San Saba counties. (Biesele
1996: 1014)
Alonzo Cowan sold his original 160 acres to J.W. Robinson in 1887 for one dollar and other
considerations, possibly payment of debt, and what followed in the ensuing years was a series of
conveyances that indicate limited use, although not land speculation. Robinson, for example, sold out to
J.F. Banks the following month for $200, an indication that there were no significant improvements on
the property at that time. The land was valued even less, at $50, when J.W. Cornelius sold to J.L. Cotton
in 1905. (Llano County Deed Records: 40/560, 40/562, 40/567, 40/568, and 46/251). It is the result of
Cottonâs ownership that historical records provide some indication of land usage. In October 1908,
Cottonâs wife, Melissa (shown in land some land records as Malissa), passed away, leaving as heirs her
husband, who served as administrator of the estate, and three children: James Elbert, Mary Florence (Mrs.
Julius) Nobles, and Minnie Eva Cotton (who later wed Eugene Lockhart). Probate records for Melissa
Cotton include a detailed inventory of the estate, which included 13 head of cattle, 4 horses, and 25 hogs.
Probate papers also indicated the Cottons lived on the land, although the estate included more than the
Alonzo Cowan land. (Llano County Probate Records: No. 471; 8/57 et seq and 471)
In 1909, as part of the estate settlement, J.L. Cotton, acting independently and as administrator, sold the
Alonzo Cowan land, along with part of the Pape survey, to Luther H. Cowan. An Anglo-American native
of Tennessee, Luther Cowan had also served as a Confederate veteran of the Civil War. He wed Margaret
Ellen Morgan in 1861, and twelve children were born to the union. The family farmed land in the Tow
area and retained ownership of the acreage around the target site well into the era of the Great Depression.
Luther died intestate in 1919, and in 1932, Margaret Cowan provided a deed of gift conveying her interest
in the family estate to her children, reserving a life occupancy for her homestead, although the location of
that homestead is not specified. She died the following year, and three years later, following a partition
suit that clarified heirship rights, her surviving heirs joined together to sell 437 acres of the family land,
including the Alonzo Cowan survey, to the Lower Colorado River Authority. (Llano County Deed
Records: 46/247, 63/549, 62/326; U.S. Census Bureau: 1880; Llano County District Court Cause 2884,
referenced in Llano County Deed Records: 66/102)

Conclusions

The artifacts observed at 41LL354 do not provide definitive diagnostics, although they do indicate a
general period of occupation consistent with the years 1890 to 1920. However, it is not certain if the
house was still extant at the time of the 1909 topographic map. If it was, the artifacts likely reflect the
ownership of the Cornelius or Cotton families, which reached from the 1880s to 1909. The property under
both families continued in agricultural use as a relatively small farm. The greatest period of development
and land utilization may have occurred during the ownership of the Luther H. and Margaret Cowan
family, but the structure at 41LL354 apparently ceased to exist during that time, likely having exceeded
its original purpose and utility. Complicating any assessment of the site as it appears today is the
likelihood that it has been bulldozed, compromising any archeological integrity that may have been
present. Relatively few artifacts remain as a result. Another complicating factor in tracking the site
233

through standard records is that the surrounding property has long been connected with land from other
surveys, making an individual assessment of the target tract conjectural at best.
The archival records associated with the property, while inconclusive, provide a broad overview of the
land ownership that included a freed slave of a prominent local family and then, several decades later,
reacquisition by descendants of the individuals who first brought the slaves to the area. No direct
connection to occupation by Alonzo Cowan, however, could be made with certainty either through
archeological or archival evidence. Adding to that disconnect is that the site lacks the necessary integrity
for eligibility under the National Register of Historic Places criteria. As a result, no further work is
necessary.

Project 27.12 Intensive Cultural Resource Investigations of LCRA's Proposed Kerrville

INTRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

LCRA proposes to upgrade the existing Kerrville Stadium to Kerrville Legion to Raymond F. Barker (T383 and T-486) transmission line located in the vicinity of Kerrville in eastern Kerr County from 69 kV to
138 kV (Figure 123, Figure 124, Figure 125). The project will consist of removing existing structures,
many of them wooden H-frames, and replacing them with new steel or cement supports that may or may
not be placed at their present locations. Therefore, only structures at angles within the existing 9.9 milelong, 96-acre ROW are assured to be at or near their present locations. The line was partially assessed for
a partial pole replacement project in 1995 (Taylor and Bates 1995), when a 100-foot radius around each
structure that was to be replaced was assessed. The report does not indicate which structures were
replaced and therefore it is unknown what portions of the line were actually assessed, although 10
previously unrecorded sites, 41KR504-41KR513 were documented and one previously recorded site,
41KR207, was revisited. None of the sites was considered significant within the ROW.
LCRA Cultural Resource Services staff, working under the terms of blanket TAC Permit 5886, therefore
determined a cultural resources survey of select high-probability areas was necessary. (No federal-level
permitting or funding is known or anticipated.) A cultural resources survey was conducted by LCRA and
contracted archaeologists over three days during the week of July 16, 2012. The work was concentrated
on areas considered to be of high to moderately high potential for containing significant archaeological
sites. These areas were primarily along and adjacent to mapped drainages crossed by the transmission
line. Sites 41KR207 and 41KR504-41KR508 were informally revisited while travelling between highprobability areas and there is no change in assessment based on observations. Site 41KR521, a burned
rock midden mostly destroyed by housing development in 1963 and with a trinomial assigned in 1995,
was within a high-probability area and received a formal revisit with shovel testing in the area of potential
effect. One previously unrecorded prehistoric archaeological site, 41KR726 â a minor lithic scatter â was
documented.
No areas or sites were encountered that require any avoidance by construction activities. No
archaeological sites are considered to be eligible for formal listing as State Archeological Landmarks. It
is recommended that the project be allowed to proceed without additional cultural resource review, with
the understanding that standard emergency discovery procedures will be in place.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

The project area is almost entirely within the Glen Rose limestone formation except for along Third and
Quinlan creeks where Low Terrace deposits, described as alluvium, gravel, sand, silt, clay and organic
matter along entrenched streams, of either Holocene of Late Pleistocene age (Barnes 1981) are crossed.
Soils are mapped as Nuvalde-Oakalla-Boerne association and described as deep, nearly level, clayey and
loamy soils found on terraces and bottom lands, and Doss-Kerrville association soils which are clayey and
loamy soils on uplands (Dittemore and Coburn 1986).

The project is located within the Balcones Canyonlands ecoregion (Griffith et. al 2007), a highly
dissected landform notable for relatively abundant surface water, a result of springs originating from the
Edwards-Trinity aquifer. Vegetation is predominated by oak savanna across upland divides with a more
diverse plant assemblage in sheltered canyons, some of which may be relict populations of species now
found primarily to the east (Griffith et. al 2007:50). In addition to expected fauna, including goldencheeked warble and black-capped vireo, exotic axis deer (Figure 126) have established free ranges (Davis
and Schmidley 1997) and are outcompeting native white tail deer by subsisting on lower quality forage
(Griffith et. al 2007:51). At least one local restaurant serves axis hamburgers.

CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The project area is considered to be in the central Texas archeological region (Ellis et al. 1995). Central
Texas prehistory has typically been divided into four main subdivisions, known variably as eras or
periods, which are subdivided further into phases or subperiods. These subdivisions combine to begin to
describe 11,500 years of history. A longstanding chronology of Prewitt (1981, 1985), has recently been
revised by Johnson and Goode (1994) and Johnson (1995), who utilized new lines of evidence based on
climatic and geomorphological data to redefine period divisions. This can be contrasted with Collins
(1995), who indicates climatic variables at times were somewhat different than those of Johnson and
Goode. The ultimate goal of many modern archaeologists is to transcend the culture history of an area
and attempt to explain why change occurred in various cultures and regions. To this end carefully revised
chronologies are to be expected and encouraged.

241

Kerr County was first settled in 1846 by Joshua D. Brown and a group of shingle makers who settled at
the location of present day Kerrville (Odintz 1997). This soon became a community and was named
Brownsborough in 1848. In 1856 Brownsborough was renamed Kerrville. Indian raids were problematic
through 1878, and as a result, Camp Verde was established in 1855. The Civil War saw high levels of
violence between anti-secessionist German settlers and Confederate sympathizers. Ranching became
increasingly important in the area, and in 1880 the Y O Ranch was established by Charles A. Schreiner.
The San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railway reached Kerrville in 1887, and provided additional economic
benefits. The railroad is no longer present, although the depot in Kerrville has been restored and houses
various shops and a restaurant. The 1932 Progressive Military Map for Center Point shows the railroad
paralleling the Old Spanish Trail, (not to be confused with the El Camino Real de los Tejas National
Historic Trail System [NPS 2011]) a transcontinental road system built between 1919 and 1929 (Fossey
2011). By 1932 the road had already been subsumed by State Highway 27, also shown as U.S. Highway
290.
By the 1920âs production of Mohair was a thriving industry. Tourism began in the early part of the
twentieth century as Kerr County acquired a reputation for a healthful climate. Numerous camps, resorts,
and health facilities were established, and remain an important part of the local economy.
Center Point was originally named Zanzenburg and was located on the north side of the Guadalupe River
(Walker 1997). It was renamed Center Point in 1872 and became centered south of the river. The widow
of the original settler, Virginia Ganahl, then deeded 200 acres on the north side of the river to the San
Antonio and Aransas Pass Railway. A depot was established, but the hub of Center Point remained south
of the river. Center Point maintains its status as a tourist destination and small business locale.
Camp Verde was established in 1855 in response to Indian depredations (THOTO). An experiment in the
use of camels for military purposes was centered here. The confederates took over the post in 1861, and
it was returned to the Union in 1865, and abandoned in 1869. The location of the army post is presently
known as 41KR111.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

Much of the archeological work in the Hill Country around Kerrville in the last seventy years has
centered on the investigation of burned rock middens, perhaps because of their topographical prominence
but clearly they represent a common archeological feature in the area. The earliest archeological work in
Kerr County occurred in 1934 in the drainage area of Johnson Creek not far to the northwest from the
present project area. Walter Goldschmidt was sent by J. E. Pearce of the University of Texas to
investigate and excavate several burned rock midden sites that were threatened by the construction of
State Highway 27 (Goldschmidt 1934). Goldschmidtâs trenches through the middens gave some
indication of their thickness (two feet) and composition. The projectile points recovered from these sites
would now be assigned mostly to the Late Archaic I period. In the late 1940s, J. B. Sollberger of the
Dallas Archeological Society excavated Lambâs Creek Mound (a burned rock midden) and the Goat Bluff
rockshelter, both sites containing Archaic as well as Late Prehistoric material (Sollberger 1948, 1949). In
242

the late 1960s, the Hill Country Archeological Society began investigating sites in Kerr and Gillespie
counties. Its members conducted excavations at two burned rock midden sites, the Sue Robinson Site
(41GL26) and the Bammel Site (41KR10) (Beadles 1969, 1971).
The early 1970s saw a marked increase in archeological activity in the Kerrville area, including the first
extensive surveys. The first major survey was a mitigation effort involving a 53,000 acre area in the
Johnson Creek drainage northwest of Ingram that would be inundated by a proposed new reservoir
(Briggs 1971). Sixty new sites were recorded and the three sites investigated by Goldschmidt 36 years
earlier were also revisited. Three types of prehistoric sites were identified during the survey: campsites
with burned rock middens, terrace sites without burned rock middens, and quarries. Relatively few
quarry sites were located, probably because areas above 1800 feet above sea level would not be affected
by the reservoir and were therefore not included in the survey. Subsequent surveys of the Ingram area
have located extensive quarry/lithic procurement sites at elevations between 1800 and 1900 feet above sea
level, an elevation were chert-bearing Edwards limestone outcrops (personal observation).
The Texas Archeological Society spent two consecutive summer field schools in 1971 and 1972
surveying the Turtle Creek drainage area south of Kerrville. The participants located 165 sites of which
63 contained burned rock middens. A number of sites were excavated during these field schools
including Late Prehistoric burned rock middens at the Paris and Real sites, and Bushwhack shelter, a
rockshelter with Archaic and Late Prehistoric components.
In 1977, the Texas Department of Highways and Public Transportation conducted test excavations at the
Shep Site (41KR109) and more extensive excavations at the nearby Wounded Eye Site (41KR107) in an
area south of Kerrville (Luke 1980). The two sites had burned rock middens that would be impacted by
improvements to Highway 16. Early Triangular points, which date to about 3000 BC, were common at
both sites making them somewhat earlier than most burned rock midden sites in central Texas. The
excavated midden at Wounded Eye contained a rock-lined hearth in its center, a feature not often found,
or at least identified, in middens up to that time.
In 1984 and 1985, Espey, Huston and Associates surveyed the 19.3 km long path of a proposed
transmission line south and southwest of Kerrville (EH&A 1985) Most of the 12 new sites recorded were
lithic procurement locales, although three new burned rock midden sites (41KR215, 41KR223, and
41KR228) were located during this linear survey. In 1994, EH&A surveyed another proposed
transmission line route south of Kerrville that ran for 13 km (EH&A 1994). During this survey, four new
sites were recorded and the Wounded Eye site was revisited. Three of the new sites were lithic
procurement locales while the fourth new site (41KR497) consisted of a scatter of flake tools.
The present project area was part of a larger survey project in 1995, when a partial pole replacement
project was undertaken by LCRA (Taylor and Bates 1995). While it is unclear exactly what was
surveyed, it is stated that a 30 m diameter area around certain structures was surveyed. Seventeen sites
were documented, although only two, 41KR517 and 41KR519, neither within the present project area,
were considered eligible or potentially eligible for SAL status. Another site, 41KR514 could not be
investigated outside the study area and was thus said to be possibly eligible for SAL status.

243

LCRA has conducted a few small projects along this line as well. In 2005 the Kerrville Substation,
located at the north end of the present project area, was scheduled for expansion. A cultural resources
survey documented a water storage system (41KR629) dating to the 1930s (Malof 2005). In use through
the 1970s, the feature was considered ineligible for formal SAL status.
In 2006 a set structure along T-383 required replacement. The structures were between Quinlan Creek
and SH 16, bordering the golf course and near substantial prehistoric site 41KR 574. A series of shovel
tests were excavated and no archaeological sites were encountered. The project was allowed to proceed
(Hixson et al. 2006:212).
In 2010 the Kerrville Travis substation was planned for expansion. A cultural resources investigation
resulted in the recording of a historic rock wall or fence feature (41KR704) that appeared to date to the
turn of the twentieth century (Hixson 2011). The project was allowed to proceed.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND INVESTIGATIVE METHODS

The project was designed to identify and evaluate archaeological sites located in areas with greater than
average potential for containing sites with research or other potential. To this end high-probability areas
were designated based primarily on the locations of streams as well as previously recorded site settings.
Low-significance sites were common across stream divides while potentially more significant sites were
near or adjacent to larger streams. Available historical maps did not show any structures crossed by the
project.
Field work was conducted by three archaeologists using a combination of windshield and pedestrian
survey and intensive survey with shovel testing in select high-probability areas. The majority of the
southern portion of the project area was along upland settings with short drainages, shallow soils and
excellent visibility (Figure 127). Closer to Kerrville there were larger streams supporting denser
vegetation in deeper soils, particularly Third Creek and Quinlan Creek, where the majority of shovel tests
were excavated.
While none of the sites present within the project area had been recommended as being potentially
significant, based on the unknown level of previous work, these sites were revisited, mostly informally,
when within or near a high-probability area or when crossed while traveling between high-probability
areas. None of the sites revisited were considered to be SAL eligible.
Field orientation was with copies of USGS maps, aerial imagery and GPS units with typical three meter
accuracy. Shovel tests were recorded on standardized forms. Field notes and photo logs were also kept.
Reporting follows Council of Texas Archeologists and THC guidelines. This draft report will appear in
final form in LCRA's annual report of cultural resource investigations for 2012.

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

One previously undocumented prehistoric lithic scatter, 41KR726, was recorded. Previously recorded
burned rock midden site 41KR521 was intensively investigated within the ROW and area of potential
effect, and a site revisit form was submitted to TARL. Sites 41KR207 and 41KR504-41KR508 were
given reconnaissance-level survey as they were crossed incidentally. Observations in the field indicated
there was no need to thoroughly reinvestigate them, based on visibility, lack of soil, site type, and
previous concurrence from THC. These sites did not have revisit forms made.

41KR726
Site 41KR726 is a minor lithic scatter located on a high upland divide between two minor drainages to the
Guadalupe River, which is situated 1,000 m to the southwest. The site as observed is only about 20 m in
diameter. It is upon Glen Rose Limestone and shallow, Doss-Kerrville association soils. Vegetation
consists of scattered juniper and oak trees over sparse grass. The property is used as pasture and horse
trails for a private children's camp, and erosion is severe (Figure 128). Observed materials consisted of
two cores, about 20 flakes, mostly large but apparently both hard and soft hammer, and two thick bifaces.
No features or burned rock was seen. The material was largely chunky in nature and heavily patinated,
and appeared to be derived from locally available tabular chert with a typical thick, reddish limestone
cortex. Given the excellent visibility in shallow soils in an upland setting no shovel tests were attempted.
The site appears to represent procurement-related activities. It is not considered to be eligible for formal
SAL status and although it may indicate other activity areas nearby, no avoidance or additional
investigations are felt to be necessary for the present project.

Figure 128. Site 41KR726.

41KR521
This is a prehistoric campsite with a burned rock midden located on the left (east) side of Quinlan Creek
in Kerrville. The original site form was sent to TARL in 1995 by Bryant Saner. The information on the
form mostly came from field investigations done by Saner over 30 years earlier in 1963 when the site was
exposed by construction of the Merrell Addition, a subdivision of single family homes. Saner reports that
one burned rock midden was present along with a hearth which he excavated. Artifacts collected from the
site in 1963 include dart points, arrow points, bifaces, and scrapers. Most of the point types Saner lists
belong to the Late Archaic I period (Pedernales, Marshall, and Castroville) although the Middle Archaic
Travis type and later arrow points were also collected. Saner witnessed two corner tang bifaces removed
from the site by artifact collectors, suggesting a Late Archaic II occupation as well. Saner felt that the site
had been completely destroyed by road and house construction, and he failed to find any trace of the site
during a later revisit.
When revisited for the current project, a moderate scatter of burned limestone rock and lithics were
observed along a slight rise to the north, east, and southeast of Structure 1/11 (Figure 129). Burned rock
was also noted in the dirt road north of the structure. Artifacts noted on the surface include a Nolan point,
an early-stage biface, and a late-stage biface (Figure 130).
Three shovel tests (ST 7, 8, and 19), placed within eight meters of the transmission line structure,
recovered moderate amounts of debitage but little burned rock from the surface down to a depth of 45 cm
within a silty loam matrix with scattered pebbles. Conversely, only about 15 meters north of the structure
on the edge of the ROW, a shovel test (ST 9) recovered over one hundred pieces of debitage with most of
it coming from between 40 and 60 cm (Figure 131). Significant amounts of burned rock were also
recovered, mostly above 20 cm, but not in the densities that would indicate a burned rock midden. Six
meters to the east of ST 9, a dozen or more burned rocks were seen lying along the base of a backyard
fence.

The landowner thinks he may have brought these up when digging posts for his fence, perhaps indicating
the presence of buried burned rock midden deposits northeast of the TL ROW (Figure 132).
Evidence acquired from the revisit indicates that the main part of the site lies (or lay) to the north and east
of the transmission line ROW under backyards and houses. Shovel testing found dense cultural deposits
only along the edge of the ROW northeast of Structure 1/11. However, no evidence of discrete
components or features was found anywhere in the ROW and it does not appear that this part of the site
has much research potential. It is not recommended for any type of avoidance or additional work.

41KR207
Most recently reported upon in 1995, 41KR207 was described as lithic procurement area and was
expanded somewhat upon the revisit (Taylor and Bates 1995:5-1), who described up to 10 artifacts per
square meter. The portion of the site crossed by the ROW was walked intermittently and found to be in a
deflated setting with greatest artifact density occurring on the central, highest portion of the site where
tabular, naturally occurring chert was present. Artifact densities dropped off significantly on either side.
A light scatter of purple and aqua glass and whiteware was observed near Silver Creek and extended
somewhat to the northwest, intermittently, for a distance of about 100 m. Careful examination failed to
find any evidence of a structure within or near the ROW. The site is not considered to be eligible for
formal SAL status within or near the ROW and no additional work or avoidance is considered to be
necessary.
41KR504
Site 41KR504 was recorded as an early twentieth century historic trash dump (Taylor and Bates 1995:54). The present survey confirmed the presence of purple and other glass, whiteware, metal and ceramics
within a small gully on the edge of a high ridge overlooking a minor drainage to the northeast. The site
appears to represent a single event dumping episode. There is no evidence of structures within or near the
ROW. The site is not considered to be eligible for formal SAL status within or near the ROW and no
additional work or avoidance is considered to be necessary.
41KR505
Site 41KR505 was described as a sparse lithic scatter about 300 m southeast of Silver Creek (Taylor and
bates 1995:5-5). The present survey may have observed more than what was seen originally, which
included several dozen flakes and at least two cores in an approximate 40-m area (Figure 133). Some of
249

the material was of high quality and appeared to have been brought on to the site in the form of stream
cobbles. Regardless, the site is in a highly eroded setting and is not considered to be eligible for formal
SAL status within or near the ROW and no additional work or avoidance is considered to be necessary.

Figure 133. Site 41KR505, looking northwest toward Silver Creek.

41KR506
Site 41KR506 was recorded as a ridgetop-spanning lithic scatter resulting from lithic procurement
activities from which a single Edwards point was recovered (Taylor and Bates 1995:5-6). During the
present project the site was crossed and no notable artifacts or artifact concentrations were observed. The
site is not considered to be eligible for formal SAL status within or near the ROW and no additional work
or avoidance is considered to be necessary.

41KR507
Site 41KR507 was described as a sparse lithic scatter on a moderate slope (Taylor and Bates 1995:5-8).
A single scraper and a possible hearth were documented. The present project found a small number of
artifacts, and perhaps the possible heath. All material was within a highly eroded setting, including the
possible hearth. The site is not considered to be eligible for formal SAL status within or near the ROW
and no additional work or avoidance is considered to be necessary.

250

41KR508
Site 41KR508 was described as a sparse lithic scatter that may have originated further upslope (Taylor
and Bates 1995:5-9). The present project could find no evidence of this site. The site is not considered to
be eligible for formal SAL status within or near the ROW and no additional work or avoidance is
considered to be necessary.
Other Areas

Shovel tests were placed judiciously with high-probability areas, typically where visibility was poor
and/or it was thought soils might contain cultural material. Shovel tests are summarized in Table 1.
Shovel tests 2 and 3 were placed on a low levee formation on the south side of Silver Creek. While each
contained a possible flake fragment the soil profile was not conducive for buried cultural zones, and the
chert materials may have been redeposited from elsewhere, as was possibly the case with nearby site
41KR504. Given the gravelly matrix of test 3, visibility of the cutbank of Silver Creek, and the generally
disturbed nature of the area, this location was not designated as a site.
Shovel test 4 and 5 were placed along a meandering tributary west of Silver Creek (Figure 134). These
tests were both negative and the cutbank of the tributary afforded excellent visibility. This area is
considered to be fully investigated.
A series of shovel tests (10-18) were placed along Second and Third creeks. On the west bank of Second
Creek a small amount of cultural material was recovered from gravelly matrix (Figure 135). This location
appears to be the southwestern end of a high-velocity gravel bar formed by Second Creek. While the
cultural material may be in situ, it was too sparse and in too disturbed a context to warrant designation as
a site. There was intermittent recovery along Third Creek, where much of the transmission line parallels
the low, active first terrace (Figure 136). Further to the south the terrace rises and becomes more stable,
but sparse recovery and excellent visibility in the nearby cutbank precluded site designation in this area.
The west, high side of Third Creek is an extremely disturbed setting that has been used as a dump or
perhaps landfill, with large chunks of concrete and other debris common. No shovel tests were attempted
in this area. No further work is considered to be necessary in the vicinity of Second and Third creek.

Where the line parallels Quinlan Creek a shovel test was placed at the angle structure south 41KR521. It
was negative. As there are no support structures between this location and 41KR521 no other tests were
excavated within the previously disturbed field. The line then runs across the active channel of Quinlan
Creek before it encounters the next angle structure near the golf course. This replacement structure, as
well as the stretch along the golf course, was previously investigated, so no additional work was
conducted (Hixson et al. 2006:212).
A one-half acre expansion is proposed for the existing Kerrville Legion substation. Located at the base of
high knoll a fairly close to a minor tributary stream this area received a cursory examination. It was
found to have been used as a storage area for gravel and appeared to have been leveled in the past. A
1960's era trash dump was along a fence in one corner of the property. Examination of various exposures
failed to find any artifacts. Overall the setting was determined to be of low probability for archaeological
sites, and no further work was conducted, nor is any further work recommended.
It should also be noted that sites 41KR509-41KR513 are also crossed by the present project. These sites
were all previously determined to be ineligible for SAL status (Taylor and Bates 1995), were in lowprobability areas and were not revisited during the present project.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

A cultural resources survey was conducted for LCRA's proposed Kerrville Stadium-to-Kerrville Legionto-Raymond F. Barker (T-383 and T-486) transmission line upgrade project. One previously
undocumented prehistoric archaeological site, 41KR726, was recorded, and previously recorded
archaeological sites 41KR207, 41KR404-41KR508, and 41KR521 were revisited. The project area is
dominated by sparse upland lithic scatters, probably associated with exploitation of local chert resources.
Site 41KR521, a burned rock midden first reported in 1995 is an exception. It is recommended that all of
the sites crossed by the project, including those not revisited, are not eligible for formal SAL status. It is
further recommended that the transmission line be regarded as fully surveyed, and that no further cultural
resource investigations are necessary.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

In 2012, the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) Cultural Resources staff conducted an intensive
cultural resource survey of the LCRA Transmission Services Corporationâs (TSC) proposed Cushman-toHwy 123 Transmission Line and Substation Addition Project in Guadalupe County, Texas. The project
consists of the construction of an approximately 6.5 mile long electrical transmission line within a
generally 24.3 meter (80 ft) wide easement and the construction of a new 5-acre sized substation within a
7.3 acre tract that will be owned by LCRA. A total of 3.07 linear miles of designated high-probability
areas within the transmission line corridor were surveyed. The entire 7.3 acre substation tract was also
surveyed. In addition to pedestrian survey of these areas, a total of 107 shovel and auger tests along with
13 backhoe trenches were excavated to aid in locating and assessing cultural resource sites. Five new
cultural resource sites, 41GU142 through 41GU146, were recorded and assessed during the investigation.
Site 41GU142 is a prehistoric campsite that is situated on a terrace on the southwest side of the
Guadalupe River. Initial work at this site showed that intact, buried burned rock features are present
within the originally proposed transmission line ROW. Additional work revealed more features and the
varying depths of these features suggested that multiple prehistoric components are present. The only
diagnostic artifact recovered during the investigations at this site was a Guadalupe Biface which should
date to 5500 B.P. or earlier.
Since the presence of these features at 41GU142 suggested that cultural deposits with a high degree of
contextual integrity could be present, several alternative transmission line alignments were then surveyed
in areas to the north of the original finds in an attempt to avoid the site. An alternative alignment that
avoids placement of any transmission pole structures within the potentially significant parts of the site
was identified and is proposed as the final alignment. In conjunction with the use of this alternative
alignment, LCRA TSC also proposes to lay a solid arrangement of hardwood mats on ground surface
within the ROW corridor from end to end across the sensitive archaeological area for construction traffic
to traverse the site so that artifacts and features are not crushed and permanent soil deformation does not
occur. Additionally, LCRA TSC will hand clear all vegetation that needs to be cut and removed from the
sensitive archaeological area at 41GU142. As a result of the investigations, site 41GU142 contains two
areas with prehistoric cultural deposits of unknown State Archeological Landmark (SAL) eligibility.
The other prehistoric sites found during the investigation include 41GU143, a deflated and diffuse lithic
scatter with no known features, and 41GU145, a prehistoric campsite that lacks any evidence of features
and has heavily bioturbated sandy deposits. A prehistoric component is also present at site 41GU144, but
artifact counts from shovel tests are low and the materials have also been mixed by bioturbation. The
portions of the prehistoric components within the project area at all three of these sites are assessed as not
eligible for formal designation as SALs.
Site 41GU146 is a historic farmstead site that dates from the early to mid twentieth century and was
occupied by tenant farmers. Neither the house nor any of the associated outbuildings remain standing.
Pedestrian survey and shovel testing

261

revealed few artifacts, which mostly consist of glass, ceramic, and metal fragments. Given the lack of
features and the artifact assemblage that is low in numbers and lacks diversity, the portion of the site in
the transmission line corridor is assessed as not meriting formal designation as a SAL.
A historic component is also present at site 41GU144. According to the landowner, the dismantled logs
of a log cabin once lay about 15 to 28 meters west of west edge of the transmission line corridor.
Pedestrian survey and extensive shovel testing of nearby portions of the transmission line ROW and more
distant areas produced no evidences of any features and extremely few historic period artifacts. All
recovered artifacts either have a long date range from the mid nineteenth through the early twentieth
century or date specifically to the early or mid twentieth century. The portion of the historic component
within the transmission line corridor is assessed as not worthy of formal designation as a SAL.
One 220 meter stretch of high-probability area has not been surveyed for cultural resources yet due to
land access problems. This land parcel is located adjacent to a tributary of the Guadalupe River on the
east side of the State Hwy 123 Bypass just north of Meadow Lane. LCRA proposes to conduct a cultural
resource survey of this tract at a future date prior to construction and submit the findings in an addendum
report. Additionally, LCRA Engineering will be gaining access to several areas outside of the
transmission line corridor that will be utilized as pulling easements. These are areas at sharp angled turns
in the transmission line alignment where heavy vehicles will be used to pull on the wires that are attached
to the transmission pole structures in order to tighten the wires and reduce slack. The pulling easements
range from 100 to 500 feet in length. The LCRA Cultural Resource staff has surveyed one pulling
easement and it is included in this draft report (see STs 16-18). The staff proposes to survey the
remaining pulling easements when land access becomes available and report on the findings at the same
time as the one 220 meter long area within the ROW.
Since the project had a âno collection policyâ, there are no artifacts that will require curation.

INTRODUCTION

The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) Transmission Services Corporation (TSC) is proposing to
construct the Cushman to Highway 123 Transmission Line Project (Figure 137 and Figure 138). The
proposed project will consist of the construction of a 138 kV electrical transmission line that will extend
for a length of 6.50 miles from the existing LCRA TSC Cushman Substation southward to the new 5-acre
sized LCRA TSC Highway 123 electrical substation. The new transmission line tapped into the
Guadalupe Valley Electric Cooperativeâs existing Hickory Forest to New Berlin 138 kV transmission line
at the south edge of the new substation.
At the north end, the new transmission line passes through the southern part of the City of Seguin. Due to
the constraints posed by the urbanized environment, the transmission line corridor will only be 60 feet in
width within the city area. Additionally, the spans between the transmission pole structures will be less
than 700 feet in this urban area. South of the city, in rural areas, the transmission line right-of-way
(ROW) will typically be 80 feet wide and the average span between transmission pole structures will be
700 feet. However, at the Guadalupe River and Cottonwood Creek crossings, the transmission corridor
spans between the structures will be greater than 700 feet. The diameter of the holes for the transmission
pole structures will range from 6 to 7.5 ft in diameter, and holes will be dug to depths ranging from 12 to
25 ft for the placement of the structures in the ground.
During the period from August 22 through October 17, 2012, the LCRA Cultural Resource staff
conducted an intensive cultural resource survey of the project area. The work involved investigation of
high-probability areas for unrecorded cultural resource sites. The investigation was conducted under the
LCRA Blanket Annual Antiquities Permit 6160. LCRA personnel involved in the project were Daniel J.
Prikryl and Andrew F. Malof (Co-Principal Investigators) along with contracted archaeologists Charles
Hixson, Patrick Hatten and Buddy Whitley.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

The project area is located in south-central Texas within the West Gulf section of the Coastal Plains
physiographic province (Fenneman 1938:100-103). Surface geology in areas adjacent to the Guadalupe
River channel consists of Holocene-era alluvium (Barnes 1974). Although the thickness of these alluvial
deposits is uncertain, it may be possible that thickness of the alluvium is 15 feet or more in some areas
(Schroeder 1999). On both sides of the river, the Eocene-era Wilcox Group occurs adjacent to the outer
edges of these alluvial deposits. While the Wilcox Group underlies deposits that extend three miles
southward to the south end of the project, the Wilcox Group exposure on the north side of the river is a
narrow 500 foot wide band. The Wilcox Group consists of sandstone, lignite and ironstone concretions.
Further northward to the north end of the project area, the surface geology is Pleistocene-aged fluviatile
terrace deposits which include gravel, sand, silt and clay (Barnes 1974).

265

Soils across the project area are variable and range from clays, silty clays and loams to sandy loams and
loamy fine sands (Ramsey and Bade 1977). The clay and loam topsoils occur in areas that coincide with
the floodplain alluvium and fluviatile terrace deposits while the sandy topsoils are found in areas
underlain by the Wilcox Group. In areas of floodplain alluvium, the various topsoils consist of the
Barbarosa silty clay, the Sunev loam, the Branyon clay, the Seguin silty clay loam and the Bosque and
Seguin soils (frequently flooded). According to Ramsey and Bade (1977), soils such as the Barbarosa
silty clay on the north bank of the Guadalupe River and the Sunev loam on the south bank of the river, all
have A and B horizon deposits of 5 to 6 feet in thickness.
Areas with sandy topsoils mostly occur south of the Guadalupe River where the Wilcox Group
outcroppings are present. The specific topsoils are the Crockett fine sandy loam, the Demona loamy fine
sand, the Windthorst fine sandy loam, the Patilo and Arenosa soils, and the Uhland soils. The Crockett
and Windthorst fine sandy loams usually have A horizons that are only about 8 inches thick and are
underlain by a B horizon clay. The Demona loamy fine sand can be as thick as 2 feet before the B
horizon clay is struck. It should be noted that one patch of Mabank loam is also present in the southern
part of the project area. It typically has a 10 inch thick dark gray clay A horizon above a very dark gray
to black clay loam B horizon.
The project area is situated on the boundary of the Blackland Prairies and the Oak Woods and Prairies
Natural Regions of Texas (LBJ School of Public Affairs 1978). The portion of the project area north of
the Guadalupe River more closely resembles the Blackland Prairie with its clay topsoils while the area
south of the river, particularly along Cottonwood Creek and its tributaries, has sandy soils and oak
savanna vegetation typical of the Oak Woods and Prairies region (Figure 139 and Figure 140). In
prehistoric times, the Blackland Prairie was a prairie grassland with narrow riparian zones along stream
channels. Because of modern agricultural practices, very little of the original Blackland Prairie habitat
remains. Remnant prairie grasses mostly consist of little bluestem. Other modern-day grasses include big
bluestem, Indian grass, switchgrass, sideoats grama, and Texas wintergrass (Gould 1975). Overstory
vegetation today in prairie areas mostly consists of mesquite, which is an invader species. Along the
Guadalupe River and smaller drainages, various oaks, pecan and cedar elm are present.
In prehistoric times, the Oak Woods and Prairies region was an oak savanna with mottes of post oak and
blackjack oaks present with mixed grass prairies. Riparian zones in the Oak Woods and Prairies region
were wider and contained a more diverse overstory. As with the Blackland Prairie, mesquite is a recent
invader species in this region.

PREHISTORIC BACKGROUND

Guadalupe County is located within the southeast boundary of the Central Texas Archaeological Region
(Prewitt 1981: 72). The county is also within the northeastern edge of Hesterâs (2004:127-128) South
Texas Archaeological Region. However, as geographical units, both central and south Texas have no

natural boundaries and are more an artificial construct resulting from the present political boundaries of
the state.
For purposes of this report, the project area is assumed to have a greater affinity with the Central Texas
Archaeological Region. This region is well known for Prewittâs (1981) detailed chronological sequence
of 11 phases or temporal periods and a detailed list of chipped stone tools, principally projectile points,
that are associated with each of these phases or periods (Prewitt 1981). More recently, researchers have
utilized more generalized temporal divisions called periods and subperiods, and they have tried to tie
climatic data to the temporal periods (Johnson and Goode 1994; Collins 2004).
Prehistoric site types in Central Texas consist of camps, caches, isolated artifacts, interments, cemeteries,
kill/butcher locales, quarry/workshops, lithic scatters, and rock art sites (Collins 1995). Central Texas is
perhaps best known for the many burned rock midden sites that occur on the Edwards Plateau. Numerous
excavations of major campsites have been conducted along the larger streams and rivers (cf. Prewitt 1982;
Collins 1998). Such excavations have demonstrated that Central Texas was occupied for at least 11,500
years prior to the coming of the Europeans. These data also show that throughout these millennia,
prehistoric people in Central Texas were hunter-gatherers who moved across the landscape exploiting
seasonally available plant and animal resources.
The Paleoindian period in Texas has been dated from 11,500 BP (before present) to 8800 BP (Collins
1998) and includes the earliest known archeological cultures of North America This period has been
traditionally divided into an Early subperiod when Pleistocene megafauna such as mammoths were still
part of the subsistence base and a Late subperiod after these animal had become extinct. Paleoindians in
central Texas appear to have practiced a generalized hunter-gather or foraging strategy.
The succeeding Archaic period is dated from 8800 BP to 1200 BP (Collins 1998) and has been divided
into three subperiods based in part on differences in projectile point technology (Johnson 1995). Like
most of the Paleoindian cultures, the Archaic peoples were generalized hunter-gathers with one difference
being their use of hot rock cooking technology (Collins 1998). The degree to which such technology was
used on the Edwards Plateau and adjacent regions to the north and west can be seen in the size and
frequency of fire-cracked rock accumulations known as burned rock middens (Black et al. 1997).
The last prehistoric period, the Late Prehistoric begins around 1200 BP with the adoption of the bow and
arrow and lasts until 300 BP when local cultural systems are starting to be profoundly influenced, directly
or indirectly, by Europeans. Archaic subsistence patterns seem to persist throughout this period (Dering
2008) although the appearance around A.D. 1250 of Toyah cultural traits, that includes new lithic artifact
forms and ceramics, would suggest that changes were taking place. Some researchers interpret the new
artifact types as part of a toolkit used by a specialized hunting culture, perhaps to better exploit bison
herds that may have had an increased presence in central Texas at this time.

HISTORIC BACKGROUND

During the Historic Period, a number of Native American groups were seen in the Guadalupe County
area. These included the Tonkawa, Tawakoni, Taovayas, Apaches and Comanches (John 1975). All of
these groups are now known to be immigrants who moved into Texas from areas to the north in the
seventeenth through the early nineteenth centuries (Newcomb and Campbell 1982, 2001). The names of
the Native American groups who occupied the area in earlier centuries are unknown.
The following historic background data is primarily derived from articles on Guadalupe County (Smyrl
2012) and Seguin, Texas (Gesick 2012) found in The Handbook of Texas Online. The earliest record of
Euro-American exploration of Guadalupe County comes in 1718 when Martin de Alarcon, the founder of
San Antonio, conducted several trips to areas northeast of San Antonio. The area remained unsettled until
Jose Antonio Navarro established a ranch at a location about three miles north of present-day Seguin,
Texas in the early eighteenth century. By 1833, there were forty land titles in the region, and Umphries
Branch settled on one of these land tracts in the vicinity of Seguin in 1833. The Texas Revolution slowed
the pace of settlement, but in 1838 a group of former Texas Rangers laid out the townsite of Walnut
Springs, with many of these men subsequently settling there. In 1839, the communityâs name was
changed to Seguin in honor of Juan N. Seguin, a Tejano who fought for Texasâ independence during the
revolution.
Guadalupe County was created in 1846 and the first school was opened in Seguin in 1849. During this
era, most settlers in the north and western parts of the county were German immigrants associated with
the Prince Carl of Solms-Braunfels colony while the vast majority of settlers in the remainder of the
county were from the southern United States. Many of the settlers from the southern states brought
slaves, although vast majority of settlers each owned fewer than 10 slaves. By the time of the Civil War,
the residents were primarily growing cotton, corn, and peanuts and raising hogs and cattle.
Many men from Guadalupe County served in the Confederate Army while the women, children and other
men tended the farms and businesses. Although the economy of the county suffered greatly after the war,
there was much less strife and violence after the war than in many other counties.
Cotton became the major agricultural crop as the county recovered from the Civil War. Production
peaked in 1900 when 38,960 bales of cotton were produced from over 100,000 acres of cultivated land.
As the soil became depleted in later years, the agricultural industry turned to corn, poultry and livestock
raising. Additionally, tenant farming/sharecropping became common in the early twentieth century with
64 percent of all farms falling into that category in 1930. During the early 1900s, the largest immigrant
population was from Mexico. However, German Americans and German immigrants continued to be the
dominant influence in shaping the countyâs identity.
Several privately owned small dams were constructed on the Guadalupe River for hydroelectric power
during the late 1920s and early 1930s. The countyâs economy was boosted by the discovery of oil at the
Darst Creek Field in the late 1920s. This oil field and other nearby fields remained active through the
1980s. Manufacturing businesses in the county doubled during the 1940s providing an additional
269

economic boost for the county. Today, many Guadalupe County residents commute to jobs in San
Antonio. About 80 percent of the land continues to be used for agricultural purposes with livestock and
livestock products constituting most of the farm income. This income is only about 12 percent of the
overall county income with much larger portions coming from professional and related services,
manufacturing, and wholesale and retail trade.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

As Shafer and Hester (2009) note, little intensive archeological research has been done in Guadalupe
County. Most of the investigations to date have been small scale projects or linear surveys restricted to
narrow ROWs. Avocational archeologists have recorded sites as well. Surprisingly, there are no
published excavations for the county.
One of the earliest documented sites is 41GU3, located about three miles west of the current project
where sandstone-strewn uplands of the Eocene-age Wilcox formation lie adjacent to the Guadalupe River
channel (Shafer and Hester 2009). It was once an extensive, probably shallow archeological site covering
200 acres where local relic hunters collected Archaic and Late Prehistoric points. The site was never
adequately recorded before it was destroyed by a housing development. About a mile and a half to the
east of the current project area on the north side of the Guadalupe River lies another prehistoric site,
41GU21. It extends for three quarters of a mile along the crest of the high terrace composed of
Pleistocene alluvium. The shallow deposits were mostly disturbed by construction and looting, but some
areas were still thought to be intact in 1976. Artifacts noted from the site include projectile points and
other stone tools along with burned rock. Present-day aerials show the terrace crest is lined with large
residences.
A few small archeological sites have been recorded within the city limits of Seguin west of the northern
end of the current project area. Most of these lie along Walnut Creek, a tributary of the Guadalupe River
running west of the commercial district. A 2009 survey by CAR for the Walnut Branch Creek Hike and
Bike Trail recorded three sites along this creek. Site 41GU15 is described as an early twentieth century
trash scatter, while the other two sites, 41GU13 and 41GU14, contain a small amount of both historic and
prehistoric artifacts in disturbed contexts. Another site, 41GU7, located further upstream on Walnut
Creek, was recorded during a 1975 transmission line survey. It contains a light scatter of debitage and
burned rocks displaced downslope by erosion. Site 41GU30 is a prehistoric campsite located on a small,
short tributary of the Guadalupe River 3000 feet downstream from Walnut Creek. The site has not been
thoroughly investigated but was visited by avocational archeologists and someone affiliated with CAR.
The site is estimated to cover three acres. One investigator thought it contained stratified cultural deposits.
Projectile points collected from this site span the Archaic through Late Prehistoric.
One of the earliest houses in Seguin, Los Nogales (41GU16), is located just south of the commercial
district. The site form says that by 1765 it was used as a stop along the Old Spanish Trail, although the
Texas Historical Marker in front states it was built in 1849.

270

In 2009, Abasolo Archaeological Consultants conducted a survey for improvements to the Springs Hill
Treatment Plant located about three miles west of the project area (Shafer and Hester 2009). The plant
lies on the second terrace on the south side of the Guadalupe River where ten backhoe trenches were
placed. Two new archeological sites were located: 41GU127, which contained mixed and shallow
prehistoric and historic cultural deposits, and 41GU128, which contained potentially intact Late Archaic
and Late Prehistoric deposits. The previously recorded site, 41GU3, was found to extend into the project
area but that portion of the site was assessed as not SAL-eligible.
In 1999, Paul Price Associates conducted a cultural resources survey for a Guadalupe-Blanco River
Authority water pipeline that ran through portions of Caldwell, Hays, and Guadalupe Counties (Schroeder
1999). The path took it mostly through Blackland Prairie and some Holocene creek and river valleys.
The surveyed route began at a point a little over a mile north of the Blanco River and ended on the north
side of the Guadalupe River near Clear Springs about ten miles upstream from the current project area.
The survey recorded 29 archeological sites containing 16 prehistoric components and 20 historic
components. Twelve of these sites were assessed as not meeting the requirements for SAL designation
and were considered fully recorded by the survey-level investigation. Fourteen other sites were assessed
as having unknown SAL eligibility and three historic sites were not assessed at all. Four of the sites with
unknown SAL eligibility could not be avoided by re-engineering the pipeline and were therefore further
assessed by test excavations.
The survey found that prehistoric campsites are located on the terraces of the major streams, in particular
the low areas north of the San Marcos River. Nearly all of these sites contain deeply buried material,
burned rocks, mussel shell, and lithics, and were potentially eligible for SAL designation. Prehistoric
sites in upland areas consist of light surface scatters of debitage and a few tools. Historic sites included,
cemeteries, late nineteenth and twentieth century houses or former house sites, ranching and farming
facilities, the Lake Dunlap Dam (completed in 1928), and two Spanish Colonial sites including a section
of an old road that could be part of the Camino de Arriba (41HY290).
Another long linear project that included the Seguin area was the SH130 toll road (Rogers and Russell
2008). Fourteen sites were recorded in Guadalupe County, ten with prehistoric components and nine with
historic components. Only one of the Guadalupe County sites, 41GU83, located on tributary of the San
Marcos River, was considered potentially eligible for SAL designation. A hearth with burned rock was
encountered one meter below the surface in a backhoe trench and the site was recommended for testing.
Site 41GU117 (the McKee Site) is located about one mile west of the project area where Business 123
crosses the Guadalupe River. The site is on the south side of the river in a setting not dissimilar to
41GU144, recorded during this project, although the terrace edge is more pronounced and a relatively
large tributary stream fronts the site to the west. The site form describes an extensive array of timediagnostic artifacts dating from the Early Archaic through Late Prehistoric I as well as Guerrero points
and "historic ceramics." Notable was the presence of at least 40 Guadalupe tools. At one point there was
an interest in Angostura-like points reported from the site, with some suggesting a cultural affiliation with
similar types seen at Buckeye Knoll (Texas Archaeological Society 2008). The Southern Texas
Archaeological Society excavated at the site for several seasons, through 2011, although newsletters
indicate that excavations ceased due to the amount of recovered materials (STAA 2011).
271

Eight miles east of the project area lies the Wilson Utility Pottery Kilns Archeological District. The
district contains three archeological sites (41GU4, 5, and 6) relating to stoneware workshops in operation
in the second half of the nineteenth century (Brackner 2012). The sites contain the remains of kilns,
waster piles, and other features associated with stoneware manufacture.
The first of these potteries (41GU6) was established in 1857 by John MacKamie Wilson, a minister
originally from North Carolina, whose slaves actually produced the stoneware. The waster piles at
41GU6 contain sherds with an alkaline glaze (using wood ash and clay, a southern tradition) and sherds
with salt glaze (commonly used by Midwest and northern stoneware potters). In 1869, three of his former
slaves, Hiram, James, and Andrew, who took the last name of Wilson, founded their own pottery nearby
at 41GU5. About this same time, two potters who had worked for John Wilson, Marion J. Durham and
John Chandler, also established a stoneware pottery on Salt Creek (41GU4). In 1884, the two surviving
Wilson potters joined Durham and Chandler at 41GU4. This pottery remained in operation until 1903.
The Center for Archeological Studies has been involved in documenting and preserving 41GU4 and the
Wilson Pottery Foundation has apparently carried out some excavations at the site.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND FIELD METHODS

The purpose of the cultural resource assessment was to identify and evaluate the State Archeological
Landmark (SAL) status of all cultural resource sites in the project area. The project was undertaken in
accordance with survey standards established by the Texas Historical Commission as prescribed in the
Antiquities Code of Texas. Prior to the field investigation, pertinent literature on previous cultural
resource investigations was reviewed. A file search showed that there are no previously recorded cultural
resource sites within the project area. The file search also indicated that no parts of the project area had
ever been investigated by professional archaeologists. Three cultural resource sites, 41GU21, 41GU30
and 41GU117, are situated within 2 km of the project area. These three sites are all prehistoric campsites
located on terraces adjacent to the Guadalupe River. Overall, the file search suggested that there is a high
probability for prehistoric sites to be located in areas near the Guadalupe River and its tributaries.
Historic maps, principally consisting of USGS topographic maps dating to the early twentieth century,
were inspected to determine if any house structures or other historic features were shown within or near
the transmission line corridor. Historic maps that were examined included the San Marcos and Smiley,
Texas 1908 1:250,000 USGS maps, the Seguin, Texas 1924 1:62,500 USGS map and the Dewville, Texas
1935 1:62,500 US Army Corps of Engineers map. More modern maps inspected were the Seguin, Texas
1964 7.5â USGS map (photorevised in 1973) and the Thomas Springs, Texas 1961 USGS map
(photorevised in 1987). These maps indicated that a total of four former rural house sites might be within
the transmission line corridor and that four other former rural house sites lay near the transmission line
right-of-way.
As a result of the file search and review of previous investigations, 3.21 miles or 49 percent of the 6.50
mile long transmission line were assessed as having a high probability for unrecorded cultural resource
sites. (Figure 141 and Figure 142). Additionally, the entire 7.3 acre tract upon which the electrical
272

substation will be constructed was assessed as a high-probability area. Specific high-probability areas for
prehistoric sites are as follows: 1) all of the Holocene alluvial terraces on the Guadalupe River, 2) the
Pleistocene terrace areas along the outer edges of theses Holocene alluvial terraces, 3) the first and second
terraces bordering Cottonwood Creek and its tributaries, and 4) the high terrace peak where the Hwy. 123
Substation is located. Specific areas with high probabilities for historic period sites based on historic
topographic maps are as follows: 1) the area from 85 to 170 meters south of the Cushman Substation, 2)
the terrace area about 875 meters north of the Guadalupe River, 3) a 1,000 meter long section of the
transmission line ROW south of the intersection of the State Hwy. 123 Bypass and Meadow Lane, 3) the
transmission line corridor segment at its west end of Park Meadow Lane to a point 125 meters southward,
4) the transmission line corridor from 375 to 750 meters south of Cottonwood Creek, and 5) the
transmission line corridor from 500 to 625 meters north of Lange Road.
The intensive cultural resource field survey conducted for this project consisted of pedestrian survey,
shovel tests, mechanical auger tests, and backhoe trenching of the high-probability areas described above.
During the pedestrian survey, a four person crew walked zig-zag transects down the length of the
transmission line corridor. Bare and eroded areas were carefully inspected for cultural materials. Shovel
and auger tests, collectively termed subsurface tests (STs), were excavated primarily in areas adjacent to
proposed transmission pole structures and in other areas where surface visibility was poor and/or in areas
with a potential for buried cultural deposits.
When cultural resource sites were found, then additional subsurface tests were dug to aid in defining the
site boundaries and the site contents. All STs were 35 to 40 cm diameter holes that were excavated 20 cm
levels with all fill being screened through Â¼ inch wire mesh to determine if any artifacts were present.
The STs were dug to bedrock/B horizon clay or to a depth of at least one meter below ground surface if
bedrock/B-horizon clay was not struck.
On the alluvial terraces of the Guadalupe River and on one unnamed tributary of the Guadalupe River,
backhoe trenches were excavated to search for sites that were more deeply buried than the depths of the
STs. Backhoe trenches were also excavated at site 41GU142 to aid in determining site contents and the
overall potential significance of the site. During the excavation of backhoe trenches, one crew member
stood on ground surface adjacent to the backhoe trench to visually examine the floor of the trench after
each bucket load of dirt was removed. Two other crew members were stood adjacent to the backdirt pile
to examine each load of dirt that was removed from the trench. Following the excavation of each trench,
the walls of the trench were carefully examined for evidence of cultural features and artifacts. A onemeter wide portion of one of the walls of each backhoe trench was troweled and the soil zones were
etched in the wall. The one-meter wide wall section was then photographed and a scale drawing showing
the soil zone boundaries was typically drawn. In some cases, a 40x40 cm column was excavated off the
wall of the backhoe trench if there were indications that buried cultural materials were present. These
columns were recorded as STs and excavations following the same methodology used for STs.

Any cultural resource sites that were discovered during the field survey were recorded on State of Texas
Archeological Site Forms, and sketch maps of each site were to be drawn in the field. Site locations were
plotted of USGS maps and on aerial photographs. The survey had a âno collectionâ policy. Therefore,
there will be no artifacts to curate at TARL at the conclusion of the project.

SURVEY RESULTS

Except for one 220 meter long stretch of the corridor where land access was not obtained, all highprobability areas within the transmission line corridor were surveyed during the course of the
investigation. A total of 107 STs and 13 backhoe trenches were excavated. The soil profiles of the STs
and backhoe trenches are found in Appendix 1. Five cultural resource sites were recorded and assessed
during the survey. Descriptions of those sites and other work accomplished during the field investigation
are described below.

SITE DESCRIPTIONS

41GU142
This prehistoric site is located on a terrace with cultural materials extending from 110 to 200 m southwest
of southwest bank of the Guadalupe River (Figure 143). The terrace edge and slopes within the site
boundaries and northeastward to the river bank contain scattered pecan, oak, and hackberry trees while
the flat terrace top at the west edge of the site is cleared pastureland. In recent years, the landowner has
cleared and burned some trees and brush within the site area. Based on pedestrian survey, backhoe
trenching, and shovel and auger testing of the original transmission line route and four possible alternate
routes, the known part of the site covers a 90x90 m area. Cultural materials observed at the site consist of
intact burned rock features, chert debitage, cores, and tools along with burned limestone rocks, mussel
shells, snails and a few bone fragments and possible pieces of hematite. The only diagnostic artifact seen
during the survey was a Guadalupe Biface, which was observed in wall of BHT 9 at a depth of 88 cm bgs
(below ground surface).
The investigations suggest that the density of materials, depths of deposits, and degrees of preservation of
materials are all variable across the site. Within the originally proposed transmission line corridor in the
southern part of the site, cultural materials were seen from ground surface to 130 cm bgs in the eastern
and central parts of the site but only from 60 to 100 cm below ground surface at the western end of the
site. Importantly, within this originally proposed right-of-way corridor, the western edge of a burned rock
feature, Feature 1, was struck at 90 to 97 cm bgs in BHT 5 in the southwestern end of the site near the
proposed location of a transmission pole structure. Two other burned rock features, Features 2 and 3,
were seen at 55-65 cm and 110-130 cm bgs during the excavation of BHT 8 which was placed within the

276

Figure 143. Site 41GU142.

the originally proposed transmission line corridor on the terrace top edge in the south-central part of the
site. No artifacts were found in BHT 7 and its companion ST 65 where a second transmission pole
structure was slated for construction immediately east of the site.
When Feature 1 was struck, the trenching was immediately halted and ST 64, a 40x40 cm shovel test, was
excavated off the south wall of the trench directly over the portion of the feature exposed in the south wall
of the trench. Minor amounts of chert debitage (n=11), burned rock (n=30), mussel shell fragments
(n=2), and burned chert (n=1) were recovered from 60 cm bgs to the top of the feature at 90 cm bgs with
the majority of these materials being found in between 80 and 90 cm bgs. The feature was uncovered at
depths of 90 to 97 cm bgs over most of the floor of ST 64 (Figure 144). It also extended an additional 40
cm northward across the adjacent floor of the backhoe trench. However, the overall dimensions of the
feature remain uncertain. In addition to the burned limestone rocks that constitute the majority of the
feature, some pieces of burned and unburned chert are also present among the burned rocks.
Overall, the discovery of Features 1-3 in the original ROW suggested the presence of cultural deposits
with a high degree of contextual integrity. Additionally, artifact counts from STs 20 and 21 were
moderately high and suggested that other burned rock features could be present in the areas near these
STs.
277

Figure 144. View of burned rock feature in bottom of ST 64.

Further survey and backhoe trenching work was then conducted north of the originally proposed
transmission line corridor along four possible alternate corridor routes in attempts to find the boundary of
the site so that impacts to cultural deposits could be minimized or avoided. At the northernmost of the
alternate routes, substantial prehistoric deposits were found in Backhoe Trench 9 and associated ST 66.
Feature 4, another burned rock hearth feature, was observed in the north wall of this trench at 110 cm bgs.
Numerous burned rocks and some scattered charcoal were also seen in the opposite wall of this trench at
depths of 90 to 145 cm bgs to suggest that one or more additional features are situated at those depths
(Figure 145). ST 66 which was excavated off the wall of this trench to a depth of 130 cm produced minor
numbers of chert debitage and burned rock fragments in all levels except Level 3 (40-60 cm bgs).
Backhoe Trenches 10-12 was subsequently excavated in the gap between BHT 5 and 9 along the western
edges of the other three alternate routes. These trenches each produced very sparse prehistoric materials
and no evidences of features. BHT 13 was then excavated on the terrace slope east of BHTs 11 and 12.
This last trench and associated ST 68 yielded very low numbers of artifacts and no identifiable features.
BHT 4, which was located a little further southward, had previously yielded similar unimpressive results.

278

Figure 145. South wall profile of BHT 9 at site 41GU142.

In summary, two portions of the site, the south area and the far northwest end of the site are assessed as
containing potentially significant prehistoric deposits that may potentially merit formal designation as a
SAL (Figure 143). In the south area, BHTs 5 and 8 revealed intact features while and STs 20 and 21
showed moderate numbers of artifacts which suggested that intact features may lay in nearby areas. At the
far northwest end, BHT 9 showed evidences of multiple features at depths ranging from 90 to 145 cm bgs.
Based on the terrace landform, it is probable that additional potentially significant parts of the site extend
north and northwest of the BHT 9 in areas that were not explored during the current survey.
Based on these findings, LCRA TSC proposes an alternative transmission line alignment which will place
both transmission pole structures outside of the potentially significant parts of the site (see Figure 143).
279

This alignment will also aid in a second goal of decreasing the number of landownerâs pecan trees that
would have to be removed. At the west end of the site, LCRA TSC proposes to erect a structure between
BHTs 10 and 11 where artifact recovery was sparse and no features were seen. Additionally, 15 meters
downslope within the projected alternative transmission line ROW, no features had been evident in BHT
4. A second transmission pole structure will be placed outside far eastern edge of the site where ST 105
and the previously mentioned BHT 7 had both showed no cultural materials to be present.
As a part of the plan to use the alternative transmission line alignment, LCRA TSC will avoid the impacts
that may be caused by vehicular traffic within the potentially significant parts of the site by requiring all
construction machinery and other vehicles to drive over a contiguous line of hardwood mats that will be
placed down the center of the ROW within the potentially significant parts of the site. These mats
measure 8âx20âx12â and their usage will ensure that artifacts and features in the vicinities of STs 20 and
21 and BHT 8 are not crushed. Further the use of these mats will ensure that the soil deposits,
themselves, are not deformed.

41GU143
Site 41GU143 is a prehistoric lithic scatter located 1.5 kilometer east of the confluence of Elm Creek with
Cottonwood Creek within the proposed location of the Highway 123 electrical substation. It is situated
on a hilltop with an excellent view of the surrounding terrain (Figure 146). The site is spread across the
summit and southern slope of the hill in areas that have previously been cleared and terraced for
agricultural usage. This land modification is most evident in the two berm-shaped terraces that curve
across the southern and eastern halves of the field. Ground surface visibility is generally good in the area
where the berms are located (Figure 147). The northwestern quadrant is covered by moderately dense
mesquite brush, with smaller mesquite and cactus widely scattered across rest of the field. At the time of
the survey, croton and broomweed were the dominant forbs. Large post oaks grow at the southeast and
northwest corners of the field.
The known artifact inventory consists completely of lithics; these include about three dozen pieces of
chert debitage, three chert cores, one quartzite core or chopper-type tool, and two Early Triangular points.
All the lithics, except for the quartzite core or chopper, are made of a fine-grained gray to brown
Edwards-appearing chert often with heavy white patination. The debitage is concentrated on the highest
point on the hill within a 0.4 acre area. Other lithics, including the points, are loosely distributed across
the southern edge of the surveyed portion of site. Displacement of these artifacts by land contouring and
sheetwash erosion is strongly indicated. The artifact scatter may continue southwards outside project
area.
The Early Triangular points are small (3 cm in length and width) and show characteristic beveling of the
lateral edges and basal thinning. They were probably discarded late in their use-life. One of the points
has small serrations along one lateral edge and both basal corners broken off. These tools were once
thought to be knives but use-wear studies suggest they are tipped projectiles (Decker et al. 2000). Early
Triangular points are thought to date to approximately 5,500 B. P. (Turner and Hester 2011).

280

Figure 146. Site 41GU143 site maps with the substation acreage outlined in blue.

281

Six shovel tests were placed judiciously to cover the proposed footprint of the substation. A clayey soil
horizon was usually encountered near the surface, so apparently the upper sandy loam horizon as mapped
by the USDA Web Soil Survey has mostly eroded away. None of the tests recovered artifacts. Probably
buried lithics are present but are too diffuse for any to be recovered by a conventional number of shovel
tests. In any case, the context of any buried material is suspect because of the disturbances the site has
undergone.
Although the site contains artifacts relating to a poorly-known prehistoric time period, further field
investigation would not lead to an increase in knowledge. Features do not appear to be present and the
rest of the cultural material is limited to lithics that have been displaced from the original discard
locations. One possible behavioral interpretation for the site, based on the artifact assemblage and setting,
is that it represents a hunting station where weapons were refurbished. The site is assessed as not
meriting formal designation as a SAL.

Figure 147. View of southern part of site 41GU143.

41GU144
Site 41GU144 is a prehistoric lithic scatter and historic artifact scatter that may be associated with a
nearby log cabin that dated as early as the 1880s (Figure 148). The site extends across a sandy, low-lying
dormant pasture/agricultural field covered with dense grassbur, other grasses and scattered mesquite, oak
and prickly pear and then proceeds southward up a moderate slope to a lobe formed by two minor
tributaries to Cottonwood Creek, which is about 550 m north of the site center. Elevations range from
about 480-510 ft msl. Site boundaries were defined by surface inspection and the excavation of 22
subsurface tests.
282

Figure 148. Site 41GU144.

283

The prehistoric component is a low density campsite that extends over the entire 450 meter length of the
site. Shovel testing suggests that two areas with slightly more concentrated prehistoric remains are
present. These two areas consist of a 150 meter long stretch in the north-central part of the site where STs
58 and 70-73 are located and a 90 meter long area at the south end of the site where STs 90-92 are
situated. Although chert debitage, cores and burned rock fragments are denser in those two areas, the
maximum number of pieces of chert flakes/chips from any individual shovel test in these denser areas is
just 11 artifacts which are spread through a 120 cm vertical column. Elsewhere, there are typically less
than 10 prehistoric artifacts per shovel test.
The most common prehistoric artifact category is very small pieces of burned chert which are thought to
represent highly fractured heating and/or boiling stones. It is possible that some of the burned chert
fragments may have been burned during brush and tree clearing. No intact prehistoric features were struck
in any of these shovel tests. Given the lack of features and the lack of any artifact clustering by level, it is
apparent that the prehistoric remains have been heavily disturbed by bioturbation.
The historic component extends for a length of about 200 meters in the central part of the site. The
historic component consists of a low density artifact scatter that appears to be related to a former farm
house that was located outside of the transmission line ROW. Historic materials consisted of glass
fragments of aqua, yellow, purple, amber, and clear colors, wire nails, plain whiteware ceramics, one flow
blue ceramic sherd, one plain whiteware rim sherd with a painted blue band on the rim edge, and a few
rusted metal fragments (Figure 149). The flow blue ceramic is potentially the earliest artifact seen, with
common usage in the U.S. ranging from between about 1840 and the early part of the twentieth century
(Snyder 2012). The presence of wire nails (and lack of cut nails) indicates site 41GU144 represents later,
rather than earlier, use or occupation.

284

former house is shown on the 1908 San Marcos USGS map and on the 1930 Seguin, Texas USGS map in
the immediate vicinity of the historic artifact scatter. According to the current landowner, two log cabins
had previously stood on the east and west sides of the transmission line ROW, corresponding reasonable
well with two house locations on the 1930 Seguin map. The cabin on the west side was just 15 to 28
meters west of the west edge of the ROW according to the landowner. No evidence of this former cabin
site was found during a reconnaissance of the area with the landowner. Further, according to the
landowner, the spot shown to the LCRA staff was the location where the logs of the dismantled cabin had
previously lain prior to being moved elsewhere in the 1930s. Subsurface tests 83-86 were excavated in
areas of the ROW closest to the supposed cabin location with only one artifact, a thick piece of aqua
colored glass being found. ST 87 was dug 15 meters west of the west edge of the ROW in a further
attempt to find artifacts or evidences of the former structure with no historic artifacts being recovered.
The landowner also showed the LCRA staff the location of former cabin on the east side of the ROW. A
substantial historic period archaeological site was evident at this second location with numerous large
sandstone foundation stones, a well with an above ground collar, and several bricks being present.
However, this historic site is located about 36 to 45 meters east of the east edge of the transmission line
ROW. So, this second cabin site is even more distant from the transmission line ROW than that of the
first cabin site shown to the crew. STs 58 and 73 were excavated within the transmission line ROW in
areas closest to the second cabin site ST 58 produced four historic artifacts consisting of a piece of thick
clear glass, a fragment of thin clear glass, and two rusted metal fragments. All of these artifacts were
found in Level 1. ST 73 yielded no historic artifacts.
The only other historic artifact finds of note occurred at ST 89 where four historic artifacts consisting of a
piece of yellow tinted glass, a purple glass fragment, an amber glass fragment, and a thick wire nail were
recovered in the first level. A few historic artifacts including the flow blue sherd were found on ground
surface 25 to 40 meters south and southwest of ST89 but the excavation of ST 90 in this area revealed no
historic materials.
Overall, the historic component is a low density artifact scatter with artifacts potentially dating as from
the pre-Civil War era to mid twentieth century. While the former log cabin site to the east of the project
area is easy to pinpoint due to the presence of recognizable features, it lies well outside of the project
area. The location of the other cabin, which should be close to the western edge of the ROW corridor
remains uncertain. No features or artifact concentrations related to this western cabin could be found
within the ROW. Like the historic component, the prehistoric component has small numbers of artifacts,
no evidences of features, and occurs in bioturbated sandy soils. Both the prehistoric and historic
components are assessed as no eligible for formal designation as SALs. Archival research on the cabin
site consisting of courthouse deed and title research, as well as interviews with the present landowner and
a former tenant are summarized in a subsequent section of the report combined with archival work for
41GU146.

285

41GU145
This prehistoric site is located on a terrace slope in a cleared pasture 40 to 150 meters north of
Cottonwood Creek (Figure 150). The main portion of the site is situated about 25 to 35 feet upslope from
the creek bank in an area with very sandy topsoils. The site was probably originally within the riparian
zone that bordered the creek channel where live oak, post oak, American elm, pecan and hackberry trees
are common today.

Some artifacts are evident on ground surface in the backdirt piles of gopher burrows, but the majority of
artifacts recovered at the site came as the result of shovel and auger testing (Figure 151). The survey
work indicated that prehistoric lithic debitage, burned chert and sandstone rocks, and other numerous
small burned chert spalls are present. Additionally, one small mussel shell fragment was found. The
burned chert and burned sandstone rocks were probably used to line hearths or were used as boiling
stones. The chert debitage is suggestive of the final stages of tool production and tool maintenance. No
diagnostic artifacts or features were found.
The subsurface testing showed highly variable artifact counts with the most concentrated materials being
found within an approximately 25 x 25 m area where STs 74, 76 and 77 were excavated. In this
concentrated area, loamy sand topsoil deposits range from 115 to more than 160 cm. In particular, ST 74
is noteworthy as yielding the highest number of artifacts (n=111) of any subsurface test excavated during
the project. The vast majority of these artifacts were small pieces of burned chert, but no evidence of any
intact burned rock features was evident in this subsurface test. Instead, artifacts were more numerous but
were evenly spread through the upper 80 cm of deposits. Artifacts were less numerous but continued to
be evenly spread through the deeper levels to the end of the subsurface test at 160 cm bgs. A total of only
23 chert flakes and chips were counted among the artifacts from this subsurface test with almost half of
them being recovered from the first three levels.
Elsewhere, in areas as far as 30 meters to the south and 80 meters to the north, artifact density drops
dramatically to levels 50 to 95 percent below that of the concentrated area. In driving through the pasture
to access the transmission line ROW, it was noted that the site extends eastward of the concentrated area
for at least 40 meters in a recently cultivated oats field.

The portion of site 41GU145 within the transmission line ROW is probably a portion of a much larger
prehistoric campsite. Although an approximately 25x25 meter area with more concentrated artifacts was
found, no features were found in the three subsurface tests dug in that area. The soil is very loose and
numerous gopher burrows are present to suggest that deposits suffer greatly from bioturbation. The
portion of the site within the transmission line corridor is assessed as not eligible for designation as a
SAL.
41GU146
Site 41GU146 is an early to mid twentieth century tenant house site located at about the highest point of
the interfluvial lobe upon which rests 41GU144 (16). It is along a fenceline that separates a coastal
Bermuda field on the west from relatively dense woods to the east.
Soils are very sandy, and sandburs are extremely dense where the other grass has not established itself.
The house site is within a heavily vegetated âislandâ containing dense grasses, forbs and large trees.
Although the house is no longer present, it formerly stood among the trees just 5 to 15 meters west of the
west edge of the ROW. Reconnaissance outside the ROW failed to find any substantial remains, other
than a hand-dug well with a pipe casing located about 40 meters past the west edge of the ROW.
Six subsurface tests (STs 95-99, ST 101) were placed within the site boundaries. Artifacts found in these
tests along with a light surface scatter consisted of mostly clear and greenish glass and small numbers of
cobalt, amber and aqua glass. A very few pieces of whiteware were noted, along with rusted metal
fragments, an iron bolt, a piece of a fan belt and other small pieces of rubber. A couple of chert chips and
some indefinable fire-cracked chert were also encountered.
Mrs. Green recalled the house being present and used for storage in the early 1960s, after which it
disappeared from the landscape. She referenced a former tenant, J. W. Reneau, who had lived in the
house during his youth. Mr. Reneau was able to add detail to what was known. Additional information
derived from courthouse research, personal, and phone interviews is summarized below for 41GU146 and
the historic component of 41GU144. Based on the work conducted at this site, it is assessed as not
eligible for formal designation as a SAL.
Historic background, 41GU144, 41GU146
Site 41GU144 and 41GU146 are located on the Green property which is a combination of three parcels
totaling 162.1 acres located within the Eligio Gortari survey, a league of land (4,428 acres) granted to
Gortari in about 1828 as a member of DeWitt's Colony (McKeehan 2012). This was a special grant given
to Gortari because he âdesired propertyâ (Rather 1905:24). By 1838 the property had transferred to
Manual Flores (m. Josefa Coubiere), brother-in-law of Juan Seguin (Patten 2012), who fought at the
Battle of San Jacinto. In 1838 Flores established his ranch house on the south side of the Guadalupe
River opposite the City of Seguin at a place called Flores Falls. Records show Flores as a minor
slaveholder owning between one and three persons between 1846 and 1853. These included 18-year-old
Polly, purchased by Josefa, eight-year-old Charles, 15-year-old Ephaim, and 32-year-old Lawrence, all
purchased between 1846 and 1847.
288

Figure 152. Site 41GU146.

The first available Guadalupe County deed records show Bird Saffold, a lawyer from Newton County,
Alabama, purchasing the ranch from Flores in 1853 for three dollars an acre (v. D, p. 849). Bird Saffold
immediately transferred the property to his son William and daughter Sarah D. Herring (also shown as
Herron) while retaining rights to an unspecified 200 acres if he so desired. William became owner of the
property in question, which still extended to the river, and built Saffold Dam at Flores Falls where he
operated a gristmill, ferry and a large mercantile store (Gretchen 2009:13). William served in the
289

Confederacy and was adjutant general for the Texas State Troops between 1860 and 1861. He owned 56
persons worth $22,400 in 1854 and in 1865 owned 105 persons worth $52,500. His slaves included
Wilson and Sally, who were witnesses in the murder trial of a slave named Nathan accused of killing
another slave named Ruffin with a grubbing hoe (Gretchen 2009:302).
In 1867, William and Sarah sold 300 acres, including the property in question, to J. R. Anderson (v. J p.
341) for a sum of $800, still about three dollars per acre. This 300 acres was later split in half,
presumably during probate, and the 150 acres including the land where sites 41GU144 and 41GU146 are
situated was transferred from several heirs of John Anderson to R. J. Burges and Adolph Weinert on Dec
19, 1905 for a sum of $2250 ($15 per acre) (v. 26 p 199). Weinert promptly sold his share to R.L
Wupperman for $1325, and in 1909 Wupperman sold the entire 150 acres which he had acquired to
Clyde, Willie and Perry Baker (the last two single women) for $3375 ($22.50 per acre). According to
online resources, Clyde Baker (b. 1879 in Seguin, d. 1931) was a railroad clerk and at the time of his
death manager of a Woolworth store in Tyler.
In the same year, 1909, they sold the 150 acres to Robert E. Blumberg (b. 1862, d. 1947) of Seguin for
$1750 (v. 31 p. 544). The Bakers may have fallen on difficult financial times or may have received other
considerations. There are numerous transactions conducted by Blumberg about this time in the Seguin
area. Blumberg served as Seguin's mayor from 1922-1926.
Meanwhile, in 1911, an apparent remnant portion of the Anderson holdings consisting of 12.1 acres was
awarded a sheriff's seizure and sale to William Fritz (b. 1855, d. 1920), who purchased the parcel for
$363 on the courthouse steps (v. 38 pp. 180-181). About three months later, in February 1912, Fritz sold
the 12.1 acres to R. E. Blumberg, at which time the full 162.1 acres became established, and generally
referenced as a 100 acre parcel and a 62.1 acre parcel.
Two years later, in 1913, Blumberg sold the 162.1 acres to Louis Pape for $6480 (almost $40 per acre).
The increase in value suggests improvements, agricultural or otherwise, between 1909 and 1913. Louis
Pape (b 1873, d. 1941) was married to Margaret Nagel (b 1873, d. 1905) and then Lena Sievers Meyer (b.
1875, d. 1965).
By 1928, there was at least speculation on oil and gas, as witnessed by Louis Pape leasing a portion of
mineral rights to E. L Chapman (v. 100, pp. 504-505). Pape also retained mineral rights on the northern
82 acres of the tract in question when he sold the parcels to Henry Seay, grand-uncle of Connie Green in
1936 for $1916 (about $12 per acre). The rather drastic decrease in value indicates a drop in agricultural
productivity and/or a decline in assessed value of other improvements, and perhaps lingering effects of
the Depression.
The Seay family traces its roots back to colonial Virginia (ancestry.com 2012). They expanded across the
southern United States and were in Texas by the 1850s and in the Seguin area by 1880. In 1948 Henry
Seay sold the 162.1 acres to his brother James for $2000 and other considerations (v. 234, pp. 477-478).
James Seay had consolidated other holdings in the same area, and in 1961 transferred the 162.1 acres to
Doris Land (nee Seay), the mother of the present title holder, Connie Green, and adjacent properties to her
siblings Mrs. Grimm and Mrs. Carly.

Discussions with Mrs. Green partially confirmed information gathered from historic maps showing
between three and five structures once located near the transmission line corridor. The 1930 Seguin map
appears to accurately depict three structures, which overlap with two poorly referenced structures on
earlier maps. All evidence indicates that there was a structure located near the north end of the property
(41GU144), which was a log cabin located about 200 m in a southerly direction from another reported log
cabin on adjacent property outside the project area (the Carly property). A third structure (41GU146),
also shown on the 1963 USGS map as a barn or outbuilding, was located further southward about midway
along the lines' route across the Green property.
The log cabins were dismantled sometime prior to about 1940 and used as supplies for an addition to
another house, once a dog-trot and known as the Dugger house, located on family property near SH 123.
The later house was probably board-and-batten and was rented to the Reneau family in the 1940s, and
possibly housed Mexican laborers later in time.
J. W. Reneau, now in his 80s, lived at the rental property (41GU146) from the time he was 10 through the
age of 15 in the early 1940s, perhaps as early as 1939. The Reneau household consisted of J. W., his
brother and two sisters, and their parents. Mr. Reneau recalled the house as being "old," constructed of 1
x 12 planking and lacking a ceiling. He especially remembers snow blowing in between the gaps in the
planks one winter. Mrs. Green remembered the house from the early 1960s as having a main room facing
east and two bedrooms behind, with a lean-to addition on the back serving as an extra bedroom. There
were two wells, one near the house with a casing that was relocated, the other which seems to have filled
in.
Mrs. Green indicated that black families may once have lived in the log cabins on the property, and given
the slaveholdings of the Saffold's it is certainly possible, although it seems clear there was never an
established black community on the property. To Mr. Reneau's knowledge there were never any black
families living on the property, and his grandmother had lived in the log cabin represented by 41GU144,
probably in the latter part of the nineteenth century, thus suggesting that the cabins date back to at least
the 1880s era.
Mr. Reneau recalls that his family sharecropped and specialized in peanut production. He was not certain
but believes the landlord's share was one-fourth. Cotton had been tried earlier, and he remembered it
being planted, but root rot (Texas Root Rot) was a problem and so peanuts were the most common crop in
the sandy soils of the region.
The family apparently moved between differing landlords, and his grandmother lived with the family
between 1928 and 1931 on nearby land owned by Blumberg. Mr. Reneau presently owns a large ranch
near the Green property and spent 38 years as the owner of J. W. Reneau Egg and Poultry Company in
Seguin.
Archaeologically, there is very little evidence of historic period occupation within the transmission line
corridor at 41GU144, although some of the few artifacts that were found would correspond well with the
period during which Mr. Reneau's grandmother occupied the house. Likewise, there is very little
291

evidence left of the historic period occupation at 41GU146, although the artifacts are consistent with post1900 occupation. Deed records suggest that the house at 41GU146 was probably constructed between
1909 and 1913, and it is almost certainly depicted on the 1930 Seguin USGS map along with the two log
cabins.

NEGATIVE RESULTS WORK IN OTHER AREAS

Area south of the Cushman Substation
Both the 1908 and 1930 USGS maps show a historic structure located about 60 to 80 meters east of the
transmission line corridor at a spot about 125 meters south of the Cushman Substation. Although this
area is currently within the business section of the City of Seguin, at the time these maps were made the
structure was in a rural setting. Despite the presence of a movie theater, a medical complex and other
businesses, the historic structure is standing and occupied. It appears to be a two-story house that
probably dates to the late nineteenth century. Since it appeared possible that outbuildings associated with
this structure could once have extended westward toward the transmission line ROW, it seemed prudent
to survey the portion of the line corridor adjacent to the house. Both pedestrian survey and shovel testing
were undertaken. No artifacts were seen on the surface of the grassy field, and the excavation of three
shovel tests, STs 48-50 produced only three artifacts consisting of two pieces of clear bottle glass and a
hollow brick fragment. These artifacts were all found in ST 48 and they all appeared to be modern in age.

Alluvial terrace on the northeast side of the Guadalupe River
Intensive survey work that included pedestrian survey along with the excavation of 10 STs and 3 backhoe
trenches examined the entire 750 meter length of transmission line ROW within alluvial terraces on the
northeast side of the Guadalupe River. Review of aerial and topographic maps suggests that except for a
35 meter long stretch of the transmission immediately adjacent to the river bank, all of this terrace area
was probably previously under cultivation.
The pedestrian survey of the alluvial terrace revealed only two potential artifacts, both burned rock
fragments, on ground surface within the transmission line corridor. They were found about 320 meters
apart in a formerly cultivated field. STs 11 and 13 were excavated near the spots where the two burned
rocks were found. Both of these STs were negative down to depths of 105 and 110 cm, respectively. It is
possible that these rocks are result of burning of brush and other debris during the historic period or they
have been moved by plowing into the transmission line ROW from nearby sites.
Elsewhere, STs 10 and 12 and BHT 1 and 2 were excavated at the approximate locations of two
transmission pole structures that will be erected in northern and central parts of the alluvial terrace. The
soil profiles of the STs and BHTs were variable and detailed descriptions are found in Appendix 1.
Generally, dark gray and grayish-brown clay and silty clay deposits of 35 to 55 cm thickness overlay
brown, reddish-brown, and yellowish-brown silty clays and clayey silts in these trenches. The two
292

trenches sampled deeper deposits down to about 2 meters below ground surface. No cultural materials
were found in any of these STs and BHTs.
At the southwest end of the alluvial terrace near the bank of the Guadalupe River, the excavation of STs
15-18 showed a 20 to 40 cm thick dark grayish-brown silty clay loam topsoil above a slightly lighter
colored grayish-brown silty clay loam to a depth of about 88 cm bgs. The excavation of BHT 3 near the
proposed location of a transmission pole structure in this same vicinity showed that a soil deposit that is
either a silty loam or a loamy silt extended from approximately 88 cm to 176 cm bgs. From 176 to 185
cm, a brown gravelly silty loam deposit that may represent a single flood event was noted. Below the
gravelly deposit, brown clayey silt extended to the bottom of the trench at 216 cm bgs. No artifacts were
found in subsurface testing of this area.

Alluvial terrace on southwest side of the Guadalupe River southwest of site C-1
In addition to a negative results pedestrian survey, STs 23-27 and BHT 6 were excavated in the 530
meter-long alluvial terrace area southwest of 41GU142. Two of the STs were dug at the locations of
proposed transmission pole structures and the remaining three STs sampled other areas including a slight
topographic rise in the floodplain and a terrace adjacent to a tributary creek. Except for two small burned
rock fragments recovered in ST 26 at depths between 80 and 100 cm below ground surface, no artifacts
were found in any of the STs. Since ST 26 is located near the previously mentioned tributary creek, BHT
6 was later excavated in this vicinity to further check for a buried prehistoric site. The trenching revealed
no additional potential artifacts either in the walls or backdirt of the trench. A sample of fill equivalent to
a second ST was then removed from the wall of this trench and screened in 20 cm levels to further sample
the area. No artifacts were recovered.

Upland terrace west of State Highway 123
A 1,110 meter-long stretch of the transmission line corridor beginning just northwest of the intersection
of State Hwy 123 and Meadow Lane and continuing southward across Meadow Lane on the west side of
State Hwy 123 was surveyed. At the north end of this area, the primary concern was locating any
unrecorded prehistoric sites that might be present near an unnamed tributary of the Guadalupe River.
Within the southern three-quarters of this survey area there were also possibilities that as many as three
former rural farmsteads might be present, as indicated by the 1908 San Marcos, Texas USGS map and the
1930 Seguin, Texas USGS map.
Investigation of this area consisted of pedestrian survey and the excavation of 14 STs. Ground surface
visibility was variable and aerial maps suggest that the south-central part of this survey area has been
heavily damaged in recent years by brush clearing. Topsoils in this survey segment included the Branyon
clay on the north side of Meadow Lane where ST 106 was excavated and Demona fine sandy loam and
Crockett loam each of 30 to 40 cm thickness south of Meadow Lane.
High-probability areas for prehistoric sites were sampled by STs 29, 30, 37-39 and 106 and the former
locations of historic farm houses shown on early topographic maps were examined with STs 35-37. One
293

old structure that may be a former house or barn could be seen in heavy vegetation about 25 meters west
of the transmission line ROW edge. The structure is not near any of the three farmstead houses shown on
the 1908 San Marcos and 1930 Seguin topographic maps. Three STs that were excavated in areas within
the transmission line ROW closest to the structure were all negative.

Park Meadow Lane southward for 125 meters
A 125 meter long stretch of the transmission line was surveyed due to the fact that a house structure was
plotted as being located about 45 west of the transmission line ROW. Upon arriving at the survey area,
the crew noted that a windmill and possible cattle watering trough appeared to be present west of the
transmission line ROW at the approximate location where the house may have once stood. Ground
surface visibility within the transmission line ROW in this area was found to be good. However, no
cultural materials other than some modern bottle glass fragments were seen on the surface. These glass
fragments were all seen in the area closest to the present-day county road and are probably from bottles
discarded by passing motorists.

Tributary creek south of site 41GU146
The transmission line ROW crosses the head of a tributary creek approximately 140 meters south of
historic site 41GU146. This area was found to be wooded with oak and hackberry trees and brush. The
creek channel is shallow and currently has no water within it. Pedestrian survey along the flanks of the
stream channel revealed no artifacts. STs 102 and 103 were then excavated on the either side of the creek
with negative results. These shovel tests revealed 40 to 50 cm thick loamy sand topsoil deposits.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

In 2012, the LCRA Cultural Resources staff conducted an intensive cultural resource survey of the LCRA
TSC Cushman to Hwy 123 Transmission Line and Substation Addition Project in Guadalupe County,
Texas. A total of 3.07 linear miles of designated high-probability areas were surveyed. In addition to
pedestrian survey of these high-probability areas, a total of 107 shovel and auger tests along with 13
backhoe trenches were excavated to aid in locating and assessing cultural resource sites. Five new
cultural resource sites, 41GU142 through 41GU146, were recorded and assessed during the investigation.
Site 41GU142 is a prehistoric campsite that is situated on a terrace on the southwest side of the
Guadalupe River. Initial work at this site showed that intact, buried burned rock features are present
within the originally proposed 24 meter wide transmission line ROW. Additional work revealed
additional features and indicated that these features occur at depths ranging from 55 to 145 cm below
ground surface. Although multiple prehistoric components appear to be present, the only diagnostic
artifact recovered during the investigations at this site was a Guadalupe Biface which should date to 5500
B.P. or earlier.
294

Since the presence of these features at 41GU142 suggested that cultural deposits with a high degree of
contextual integrity could be present, several alternative transmission line alignments were then surveyed
in areas to the north of the original finds. An alternative alignment that avoids placement of any
transmission pole structures within the potentially significant parts of the site was identified and is
proposed as the final alignment. The plan to avoid impacting any potentially significant parts of the site
also includes provisions that a solid arrangement of hardwood mats be placed on ground surface within
the ROW corridor from end to end across the sensitive archaeological area for construction traffic to
transverse the site so that artifacts and features are not crushed and permanent soil deformation does not
occur. Additionally, the plan includes the provision for land clearing all vegetation that needs to be
removed from the sensitive archaeological area so that deposits are not damaged.
The other prehistoric sites found during the investigation include 41GU143, a deflated and diffuse lithic
scatter, and 41GU145, a prehistoric campsite that lacks any evidence of features and has heavily
bioturbated sandy deposits. A prehistoric component is also present at site 41GU144, but artifact counts
from shovel tests are low and the materials have also been mixed by bioturbation. The prehistoric
components of all three of these sites that are within the project area are assessed as not eligible for
formal designation as SALs.
Site 41GU146 is a tenant-occupied farmstead site that dates from the early to mid twentieth century.
Neither the house nor any of the associated outbuildings remain standing. Pedestrian survey and shovel
testing revealed few artifacts, which mostly consist of glass, ceramic, and metal fragments. Given the
lack of features and the artifact assemblage that is low in numbers and lacks diversity, the portion of the
site in the transmission line corridor is assessed as not meriting formal designation as a SAL.
A historic component is also present at site 41GU144. According to the landowner, the dismantled logs
of a log cabin once lay about 15 to 28 meters west of west edge of the transmission line corridor.
Pedestrian survey and extensive shovel testing of nearby portions of the transmission line ROW produced
no evidences of any features and extremely few historic period artifacts. All artifacts either have a long
date range from the mid nineteenth through the early twentieth century or date specifically to the early or
mid twentieth century. The portion of the historic component within the transmission line corridor is
assessed as not worthy of formal designation as a SAL.
One 220 meter stretch of high-probability area has not been surveyed for cultural resources yet due to
land access problems. This land parcel is located adjacent to a tributary of the Guadalupe River on the
east side of the State Hwy 123 Bypass just north of Meadow Lane. LCRA proposes to conduct a cultural
resource survey of this tract at a future date prior to construction and submit the findings in an addendum
report. Additionally, LCRA Engineering will be gaining access to several areas outside of the
transmission line corridor that will be utilized as pulling easements. These are areas at sharp angled turns
in the transmission line alignment where heavy vehicles will be used to pull on the wires that are attached
to the transmission pole structures in order to tighten the wires and reduce slack. The pulling easements
range from 100 to 500 feet in length. The LCRA Cultural Resource staff has surveyed one pulling
easement and it is included in this draft report (see STs 16-18). The staff proposes to survey the
remaining pulling easements when land access becomes available and report on the findings at the same
time as the one 220 meter long area within the ROW.

Project 40.12 Intensive Cultural Resource Investigations for Proposed Brush Clearing at
LCRAâs McKinney Roughs Nature Park, Bastrop County, Texas

By Andrew F. Malof and Daniel J. Prikryl

TAC Permit 6160
Interim Report 10.12

INTRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

LCRA proposes to remove brush and selected trees with a 44-acre portion of its McKinney Roughs
property located along the Colorado River in western Bastrop County (Figure 153). The project is
designed to encourage native grasslands and to clean up damage from a major wildfire that occurred in
2008. Clearing will be by mechanical means and could include shredding and bulldozing.
A cultural resources assessment was conducted by LCRA Cultural Resource Services staff in October and
November, 2012 under the terms of LCRA blanket annual TAC Permit 6160. The assessment began with
a file review that indicated much of the project area had not previously been investigated for cultural
resources. It was therefore determined that an intensive field survey was appropriate for 38 of the 44
acres.
The survey was conducted by LCRA and contracted archeologists over two days in early November,
2012. A total of 53 subsurface tests were excavated, exceeding the minimum number as suggested by
THC guidelines. No previously unrecorded archeological sites were documented. Sites 41BP451,
41BP452, and 41BP661, portions of which are within the project area, have previously been determined
to be ineligible for SAL status. However, a newly discovered feature at 41BP451, a small livestock
dipping vat of unusual construction, will be avoided.
It is recommended that the project be allowed to proceed without additional cultural resource oversight.
Standard emergency discovery procedures will be in place. This interim report will be finalized following
THC review and included within LCRAâs annual report for 2012, where additional detailed background
information will be available.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

The project area is situated in the Texas Post Oak Belt (Arbingast et al. 1976), and is within the Coastal
Plain and Great Plains provinces (Carr 1969). The project area is currently defined as post oak woods,
forest, and grassland mosiac by McMahan et al. (1984) (Figure 154, Figure 155). Surface geology
consists of Fluviatile terrace deposits of Pleistocene age (Barnes 1974). Along the Colorado River in this
area, these deposits are mostly coarse, siliceous gravels in a sandy matrix. The gravels are derived from
the Llano Uplift and Edwards Plateau areas and include chert, quartzite, dolomite, limestone, and various
igneous and metamorphic rocks.
Soils are mapped as Vernia Complex soils and Axtell-Tabor Complex soils (Baker 1979: Map Sheets 15
and 21). The Vernia Complex typically has an approximately 12-cm thick surface deposit of grayishbrown, very gravelly, loamy sand that is about 40 percent rounded gravels. Deeper, to approximately 120
cm below ground surface the typical profile consists of pink, very gravelly sand that is about 80 percent
volume gravels. Soils of the Axtell-Tabor Complex have very shallow 10-to-35 cm thick light gray-topale brown gravelly, sandy loam topsoils above red-to-orange clay subsoils.

CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The project area lies within the Central Texas prehistoric cultural region (Prewitt 1981). The prehistory
of Central Texas has recently been reviewed by several archeologists, including Johnson (1994) and
Collins (1995). These papers build upon the previous work of Weir (1976) and Prewitt (1981, 1985) that
established a detailed cultural chronology and cultural history for the region. Importantly, Johnsonâs
paper includes new data on past climates in Central Texas, while Collins discusses past and present
research theories and trends in prehistoric archeological research in Central Texas. The reader is referred
to these works for in-depth discussions of Central Texas prehistory.

Figure 155. Shovel testing in previously burned area.

Prehistoric site types in Central Texas consist of camps, caches, isolated artifacts, interments, cemeteries,
kill/butcher locales, quarry/workshops, lithic scatters, and rock art sites (Collins 1995:363). Central
Texas is perhaps best known for the many burned rock middens that occur on the Edwards Plateau.
Numerous excavations of major campsites have been conducted along the larger streams and rivers (cf.
Peter et al. 1982; Prewitt 1982). Such excavations have demonstrated that Central Texas was occupied
for at least 11,500 years prior to the coming of Europeans. These also show that throughout these
millennia, prehistoric peoples were nomadic hunter-gatherers who moved across the landscape exploiting
seasonally available plant and animal resources.
Histories of several counties have been compiled by the LCRA staff for historic background information
(LCRA files). According to these records, Bastrop County was settled as early as 1804, when a fort was
established at the location of present day Bastrop, and which was then a stop along the Nacadoches-San
Antonio road. In 1827 Stephen F. Austin received a grant from the Spanish governor, and by 1830 the
town of Bastrop, named for the Baron de Bastrop, was settled. In 1837 the Republic of Texas established
the County of Bastrop. Cotton and lumber were primary industries and by 1860 almost a third of the
population was slaves. Around 1870 industrial interests were expanding. By the turn of the century
railroads had helped to improve the economy, oil had been discovered, and a major brick manufacturing
plant was in place near Elgin. Camp Swift was established as a training center during World War II, and
in time became a prisoner of war camp as well. By 1950 a diversified agricultural base was still the main
economic strength of the county. Agriculture has been Bastrop Countyâs mainstay until recently; as
nearby Austin has continued to grow, so has Bastrop. Many residents of Bastrop now commute on a
daily basis to the stateâs capital.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

The project area was previously surveyed for cultural resources during the LCRAâs inventory survey for
the 1,100-acre McKinney Roughs Park and Preserve (Kotter et al. 1996). That survey identified 20 new
archeological sites â 41BP444 through 41BP452, and 41BP454 through 464. These sites consist of three
that are historic in age, 16 that date to the prehistoric period, and one that has both historic and prehistoric
materials. The prehistoric sites are primarily upland lithic scatters that have flint chipping debris and cores
present in shallow deposits. The historic period sites represent late nineteenth to early twentieth
farmsteads. None of these previously recorded archeological sites are situated within the currently
proposed road right-of-way.
Additionally, the McKinney Roughs Park and Preserve inventory survey area included a separate 250acre tract that had been previously investigated by Robinson (1987). Two prehistoric sites, 41BP88 and
41BP286, and one historic site, 41BP287, had been found by Robinson in that tract. These three sites
were originally thought to be similar in content to those recorded by Kotter et al. However, an emergency
discovery investigation at 41BP88 by Prikryl and Malof (1999:209-224) showed that the northwest
portion of this site is an important prehistoric campsite with features contained within an 80-cm thick
topsoil. Diagnostics found at 41BP88 indicate that the site was occupied during the Middle and Late
Archaic periods.
Between 2001 and 2010, 23 additional cultural resource investigations have been conducted at McKinney
Roughs, mostly for trails, wastewater systems, a tire cleanup project, and other small development
projects. These have resulted in the recording of sites 41BP634, 661, 675, 681, 688, 698 and 805. These
projects are described in LCRAâs annual reports for 2001-2007 and 2010. The most relevant is a survey
that covered the eastern end of the project area and resulted in the recording of 41BP661, a lithic scatter
and buried hearth that was determined to be ineligible for formal SAL status (Prikryl 2003).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND INVESTIGATIVE METHODS

The review of previous investigations could not demonstrate that the majority of the project area had been
previously surveyed, other than the eastern portion surveyed by Prikryl (2003). The northern edge of the
project area largely follows the contour that defines the edge of a canyon system that drains toward the
Colorado River. The lobes overlooking these canyon drainages were considered to be of higher
probability for harboring archaeological sites. While it is understood that much of the area is an ancient
gravel terrace deposit, it is known that there are pockets of sandy soils, such as where SAL-listed sites
41BP444 and 41BP463 are located. Because of generally poor visibility, a systematic shovel testing
program was developed. By loading the project area boundaries onto a GPS unit and also using it to
record shovel test locations, it was possible to confidently place shovel tests in specific locations. Tests
were excavated as 30-40 cm holes with matrix removed in 20 cm levels, when possible. Due to the
common dense pebbles and cobbles, most tests were terminated at 30 cm (Figure 156).

317

Figure 156. Typical fill from shovel tests.

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

No new archaeological sites were recorded as a result of the investigation. The 53 shovel tests that were
excavated included nine that were positive for cultural material, although in five cases the cultural
material consisted of chips that may have been the result of natural processes (Figure 157; Table 5). The
majority of the positive shovel tests were on the easterly lobe system where occasional cores and tested
cobbles were seen across the surface. In the opinion of the principal investigator, there was insufficient
clustering or density of artifacts to warrant site designation. While lithic scatters and lithic procurement
sites are present at McKinney Roughs, they generally can be bounded by decreasing density of artifacts.
A previously undocumented feature was recorded at 41BP451, which along with 41BP452 composed the
Goodman Ranch complex, dated to perhaps the 1930s and into modern times (Figure 158). Neither site
was considered to be significant in a regulatory sense (Kotter et al. 1996).
The new feature at 41BP451 is a circular, subterranean livestock dipping vat used for sheep or goats, as
the chutes are clearly too small for cattle. It is constructed of concrete with local cobbles incorporated
into the mix, especially along the rim. It is 4 feet deep to the present (leaf and soil-covered) bottom, and 5
feet in diameter. A short entry chute, 3 feet in length and 18 inches wide runs from the surface on the
north side and enters the vat 16 inches below the top rim (Figure 159). It has a sheet metal surface. The
exit chute is 6 feet in length and begins 3 feet below the vatâs rim. It is also 18 inches wide (Figure 160).
The vat is located on the outside edge of a rambling corral composed of various recycled materials,
including large pieces of sheet metal. A collapsed outbuilding is still present on the north side of the
corral.

The dipping vat design is quite different from typical trough construction. It seems to be a relatively
crude but apparently effective way to use minimalist or vernacular techniques to create a needed facility.
Site 41BP451 has been determined to be ineligible for formal SAL status. The newly discovered dipping
vat is of unknown SAL status, and possibly might be eligible under Chapter 26 rules 26.8(1) and 26.8(3)
in that it may contribute to a better understanding of Texas history and that it may possess unique or rare
attributes. The dipping vat and surrounding corral remains will be left in place, and therefore the dipping
vat will be avoided. Only hand clearing will occur in that area.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

LCRA proposes to conduct brush clearing activities within a 44-acre portion of its McKinney Rough
Nature Park in Bastrop County. Clearing will use mechanical methods including surface shredding and
possibly bulldozing. Systematic shovel testing failed to locate prehistoric materials in sufficient density
or with clustering necessary to define an archaeological site. While there was intermittent and casual use
of the Pleistocene gravel deposits within the project area, there is no evidence that the area was of any
importance to prehistoric inhabitants.
A previously unknown dipping vat found at historic ranch site 41BP451 is considered to be of unknown
SAL potential. It will therefore be avoided by way of hand clearing any vegetation in the vicinity of the
feature.
It is recommended that the project be allowed to proceed without constraint, other than the hand clearing
mentioned above.

The Lower Colorado River Authorityâs (LCRA) Archaeology Services staff has completed a cultural
resources assessment of a proposal by the Windermere Marina Operator to place anchors for the
temporary Windermere Marina facility location within archaeological site 41BT397 at the LCRA Grelle
Recreation Area (Figure 161). The proposal stems from the previous move of the Windermere Marina
boat slips to the boundary of the Windermere/Grelle Recreation Area property because of low water
levels last August, 2012. Presently, the LCRA Marina Program staff is concerned that the boat slips are
not well anchored and, thus, could float downstream if the lake refills to its conservation pool level during
a flood event. The LCRA has had previous experience with floating marinas causing damage to other
marinas and various properties during such flood events.
Prior to the cultural resource assessment, Mr. Patrick Ross, the Windermere Marina Operator, had placed
pin flags and had spray-painted the ground at locations where he would like to place 500-pound concrete
anchors. Each of the marked areas measures about 1.3-x-1.3 meters. On the attached figure, the
approximate center location of the boat slips is shown as a black dot while the three proposed anchor
locations are shown as green dots upslope.
A file search conducted before the field investigation indicated that the proposed anchors and boat slips
are situated within previously recorded prehistoric archaeological site 41BT397. Over the course of the
current drought and two previous droughts, prehistoric artifacts have been found on eroded slopes about
30 to 50 meters to the west and also on an eroded slope about 15 to 50 meters east of the proposed anchor
area. Those materials found to the west consist of burned rocks, chert chipping debris, and Late
Prehistoric-aged pottery sherds, while the materials to the east are noteworthy for moderate quantities of
large bison-sized mammal bones, along with burned rocks and chert chipping debris.
The proposed location of the anchors is a flat terrace surface that lies between the eroded slopes. A quick
pedestrian survey of the three anchor locations showed that these areas are covered by dense grass with
no artifacts visible on ground surface. Three shovel tests, one at each of the proposed anchors, were then
excavated to determine if any buried cultural materials were present with each shovel test being excavated
to a depth of 1 meter. No artifacts were found in any of the three shovel tests. It is probable that buried
cultural materials are present at greater depths below ground surface on the terrace based on the finds of
artifacts on the eroded slopes to the east of the shovel tests.
The soil profile at Shovel Test 1, the northernmost anchor site, showed a 6 cm thick light brown silt above
a 94 cm thick brown silty loam. The soil profile at Shovel Test 2, the central anchor location, differed
from that of the first shovel test. The profile consisted of a 15 cm thick yellowish-brown silt deposit
329

above a very dark grayish-brown silty loam with reddish-brown mottles that extended from 15 to 82 cm
below ground surface. Deeper, a brown silt was found from 82 to 100 cm. The soil profile from Shovel
Test 3 was very similar to that of Shovel Test 2.
Since a 1-meter-thick soil deposit is generally judged to buffer any fragile artifacts from damage caused
by heavy weights such as vehicular traffic across archaeological sites, it appears that the anchors can be
set at their proposed locations. However, care will be needed in transporting the anchors by vehicle to
their proposed locations. Based on a phone conversation with Patrick Ross, the LCRA Cultural Resource
staff will field monitor the placement of the anchors. Each anchor will be brought to the site individually
on a pick-up truck. The proposed pathway will extend from the existing Windermere boat ramp to the
narrow terrace bench on which the anchors will be placed. The eroded slopes to the west and east of the
terrace bench will be avoided.

Project 4.12 Cultural Resource Assessment for the Proposed Brown Country Substation
County: Brown
Type of Investigation: Field Survey
Date of Investigation: January 2012
On January 18, 2012, the LCRAâs Cultural Resource Services staff conducted an archeological survey of
the 2-acre parcel for the proposed Brown County Substation (Figure 162). The survey involved a walkover of the entire project area, inspecting areas of exposed ground surface for cultural material. Ground
visibility was poor in the low-lying western half, which was covered by thick grass. Two shovel tests
were placed in this area to detect any buried cultural remains. These tests did not recover any artifacts.
The eastern half of the project area has superficially eroded, allowing better ground visibility. A small
trash scatter dating somewhere between 1900 and 1916 was located in the southeast corner of the project
area. Because this scatter is twentieth century in age and is not associated with a house or other structure,
the LCRA is not required to record these materials as an archeological site. A third shovel test placed
north of the trash scatter did not recover any artifacts. Apart from the trash scatter, no other artifacts were
seen on the surface.
Because the proposed construction area contains no archeological sites and covers less than 5 acres, then
according to the LCRAâs MOU with the Texas Historical Commission (THC), a report does not have to
be sent to the THC for a 30-day review/comment period. Instead, the substation project can proceed
without further oversight by the Cultural Resource Services staff.

Project 6.12 Cultural Resource Assessment for the Colorado Vista Pavilion Project
County: Bastrop
Type of Investigation: Field Survey
Date of Investigation: January 2012
LCRA proposes to construct a new pavilion and upgrade existing facilities located at its Colorado Vista
property located on the Colorado River near the McKinney Roughs Nature Park in Bastrop County, Texas
(Figure 163, Figure 164). Primary ground disturbing activities will consist of pouring the foundation for
the pavilion and excavating two trenches to a maximum depth of about 3 feet to lay electrical and water
lines. Total project area is approximately 0.10 acres.
Because the project area is located in a high-probability area very near a previously recorded
archaeological site (41BP821) that appears to represent a single Toyah-aged bison processing event
(Prikryl 2009), it was determined that field investigations were warranted.
A cultural resources survey was conducted by LCRA Cultural Resource Services staff on January 19,
2012, and consisted of a visual examination of the ground surface and shovel test excavations. Shovel
tests were placed in areas where ground disturbance is anticipated to be greatest. The entirety of the
project area has been subjected to past disturbances, although these, for the most part, seem limited to the
upper 20-30 cm.
One previously undocumented archaeological site was recorded as a result of the investigations. Site
41BP869 consists of a light scatter of prehistoric cultural material found within shovel test CV3, located
along the trench that will tie the existing well-house to the existing employee building. The material,
consisting of three chert chips, a buried chert spall, and four mussel shell fragments, was recovered from a
depth of 90-100 cm below ground surface. Also present was single Rabdotus species snail shell. Test
CV4, placed about 15 m to the west, did not recover cultural material. The soil in test CV3 was different
than in all other tests, and was somewhat lighter and redder, characterized by a Munsell description of
âstrong brown.â An apparent horseshoe nail was found between 40 and 60 cm in this same test. No other
artifacts of historic or prehistoric age were encountered in any of the shovel tests or seen on the ground
surface.
Because the project will vertically avoid the known site deposits this project may proceed as described,
with the understanding that trenching within the first 30 feet of the eastern edge of the project area will
not exceed 2.5 feet in depth, and that in all areas work shall cease if unexpected buried artifacts are
encountered. Work may proceed elsewhere until a qualified archaeologist has assessed any such
discoveries.

Project 8.12 Cultural Resource Assessment for the Lindenau Substation Tap Line
County: De Witt
Type of Investigation: Field Survey
Date of Investigation: March 2012
LCRA proposes to construct an electrical tap line that will supply the new Lindenau Substation to be built by
GVEC. The tap line will extend for approximately 920 feet between the existing LCRA T-579 (Cuero to
Cheapside) transmission line westward to the location of the 4-acre sized Lindenau Substation to be located
adjacent to FM 766 . LCRAâs portion of the project will consist of constructing a tap structure under the existing
transmission line, a drop structure system into the GVEC substation site, and at least two additional support
structures within an 80-foot-wide ROW, the easement for which totals 1.67 acres ((Figure 165). LCRA will also
construct various relay and control panels and other, non-ground disturbing elements within the substation
grounds.
The LCRAâs Cultural Resource Services staff conducted a cultural resources assessment for the project in
accordance with the Antiquities Code of Texas and LCRAâs Memorandum of Understanding with the Texas
Historical Commission (THC). The assessment consisted of a file and map review, the results of which triggered
a field survey that was concluded on March 7, 2012. The field investigation was necessary because the map
review indicated that the project area was in a location of moderate to high probability for containing unrecorded
archaeological sites. Survey methods followed minimum survey standards as adopted by THC (Figure 166).
The project area is within the Miocene-aged Fleming formation, which consists of clay and sandstone. The area
is near aggrading, Holocene-aged fluvial deposits of the Guadalupe River and its tributaries. Soils mapped locally
are primarily as Sarnosa fine sandy loams, which are very dark gray soils that have a 16-inch A horizon. There is
a small area of Heiden clay mapped at the extreme western edge of the project. These soils consist of very deep
dark to very dark grayish-brown clay. The substation site is near the junction of the Blackland Prairie and East
Central Texas Plains ecoregions and is described as having Post Oak Woods, Forest and Grassland mosaic as the
dominant vegetation regime.
Although the project area is within the Cuero I National Register of Historic Places Archeological District, no
archaeological sites have been recorded in the immediate vicinity. The nearest sites are along the Guadalupe
River and its tributaries in much different settings. The two nearest sites, 41DW67 and 41DW68, were described
as quarry camps when recorded in the early 1970s.
The small community of Lindenau was located about 4 miles southwest of the project area. It was a settled area
by the late 1800s and was home largely to people of German descent. The community had a school, store,
church, blacksmith shop and other amenities, including a shooting club. The post office closed and schools
consolidated in about1947.
Upon arriving at the project area, it was seen that the substation location had previously been cleared, creating
excellent visibility in that area (Figure 167). The proposed transmission tap line roughly parallels an existing
cleared distribution line corridor, although at the eastern end, it is mostly within dense, thorny secondary growth
338

vegetation (Figure 168). The entirety of the 1.67-acre easement was assessed by pedestrian survey and shovel
tests. No artifacts were seen on the surface except for a very small number of glass shards and pieces of rusty
metal toward the eastern end. These were not present in sufficient numbers or concentrations to warrant
designation as an archaeological site.
A total of five shovel tests were excavated along the 920-foot-long corridor. This number meets or exceeds THC
survey standards for a project of this size. The tests were excavated to the maximum depth to where cultural
materials might be expected (Figure 169). Only one test, ST2, contained cultural material â a piece of rusty metal
and what may have been a piece of cut bone â in the upper 20 cm. Shovel test data is summarized in the table
below.
In summary, an intensive cultural resources survey of the proposed Lindenau Substation Tap Line Project was
conducted by LCRAâs Cultural Resource Services staff. No archaeological sites were encountered as a result of
the investigations. The project may therefore proceed without additional cultural resources coordination, with the
understanding that if unexpected buried artifacts are encountered during construction of the tap line, then ground
disturbance will halt in the area of discovery until LCRAâs Cultural Resource Services staff can be notified and
the find evaluated. The results of this investigation will be reviewed by THC within LCRAâs Annual Report of
Cultural Resource Investigations for 2012.

Project 11.12 Cultural Resource Assessment for the Proposed Brush Clearing at Horseshoe Bay
County: Llano
Type of Investigation: Field Survey
Date of Investigation: March 2012
The City of Horseshoe Bay has asked the LCRA to clear the brush from six acres of land the LCRA owns in
Horseshoe Bay in Llano County (Figure 170). The tract is located on the south side of FM 2147, 1.6 mile south
of the Ferguson power plant. The upper end of a small tributary creek runs through the east side of the property.
Although the stream is small, its presence suggests that portions of this tract have at least a moderate potential for
having a prehistoric site. The LCRAâs Cultural Resources personnel decided to conduct an archaeological survey
of these moderate potential areas, defined for this project as elevated areas along both sides of the creek channel,
amounting to about 4 acres.
Two archeologists contracted to the LCRA conducted the survey on March 28, 2012. The survey consisted of a
walk-over of the areas with a moderate potential for prehistoric sites, about 2.5 acres on the west side of the creek
and 1.5 acres on the east. Because of dense ground vegetation, shovel testing was an important part of the survey.
Five tests were placed on the west side of the creek and three tests on the east, meeting the THCâs minimum
requirements of eight shovel tests for a survey area of four acres. The shovel tests consisted of digging 35 cm
diameter holes and screening the excavated fill through a one-quarter inch hardware cloth to recover buried
artifacts. All tests were dug to the clay B horizon, usually encountered at a depth of 1 foot (30 cm).
No artifacts were observed on the ground within the survey area or recovered from the eight shovel tests.
Although on the USGS topographic map the area looks like it has some potential for an archaeological site, onthe-ground observations found that the land was poorly drained because of the dense clay subsoil and not suitable
for habitation. Because no archeological sites are located in the project area â and therefore no State
Archeological Landmarks (SALs) are present â the proposed brush clearing can proceed by virtue of this memo.

Project 12.12 Cultural Resources Assessment of Proposed Garwood Gravel Pit Temporary Storage
Pilot Project
County: Colorado
Type of Investigation: Field Survey
Date of Investigation: April 2012
The LCRAâs Cultural Resource Services staff has completed a cultural resources assessment of the proposed
Garwood Gravel Pit Temporary Storage Pilot Project on the Lehrer Tract in Colorado County, Texas. The goal of
the project is to pipe water from an existing LCRA irrigation canal into an existing gravel pit during periods of
high water flows for temporary storage. The water will then be piped back into the LCRA irrigation canal system
at later times as needed for irrigation purposes (Figure 171, Figure 172).
The project elements include the construction of a check dam structure and the placement of an adjacent 107-cm
(42-inch) diameter pipeline that will transfer water from a large LCRA canal located southwest of the gravel pit
complex into a smaller canal that extends on a northeast-southwest line along the south side of the gravel pit.
This pipeline will be placed in an open cut backhoe trench that will extend for a distance of about 18.3 meters (60
feet). At the location of the larger canal, the backhoe trench will be excavated to a depth of about 5 feet. The
depth of the trench will decrease as it extends eastward so that it will be about 61 cm (2 feet) below ground
surface when it intersects the small canal.
The excess water transferred into the smaller canal will then flow about 975 meters (3,200 feet) northeastward
where three 76 cm (30-inch) diameter pipes will allow the water to flow out of the canal and across the ground
surface northward for a distance of 122 meters (400 feet) into the gravel pit. The piping for this part of the
project will utilize an existing 76 cm (30-inch) diameter pipe along with two new 76 cm (30-inch) diameter pipes
that will be placed adjacent to the existing pipe. The new pipes will be laid in open cut trenches at distances of
about 61 cm (2 feet) on either side of the existing pipe. These two new pipes will extend for lengths of about 40
feet each and the depth of excavation for these two pipes will be about 1.2 to 1.52 meters (4 to 5 feet) below
ground surface.
The final part of the project involves the construction elements for transfer of the excess water out of the gravel
pit back into the canal as needed at later dates. This will be accomplished by setting a pump machine on the
waterâs edge at the north end of the gravel pit and piping the water northwestward through two 61-cm (24-inch)
diameter pipes back into the main canal. These two pipes will each extend for a length of about 229 meters (750
feet). The vast majority of these two pipes will lay directly on ground surface. Small sections of the pipes will be
placed underground where they cross a gravel road and where they cross a small terrace rise about midway along
the length of the pipeline route. Depth of excavation at these two points will vary from 61 to 122 cm (2 to 4 feet)
below ground surface.
Prior to the field investigation, a file search was conducted by the LCRA Cultural Resource staff. The file search
showed that there are no previously recorded cultural resource sites within or near the project area. The file
search also indicated that no parts of the project area had ever been surveyed by professional archaeologists for
cultural resources. A small creek channel that is one of the tributaries that converge further southward to form
346

West Mustang Creek appeared to have originally run through the project area. Most of this channel has been
destroyed by the gravel mining but the channel is visible and both the north and south of the gravel pit near
several of the project elements. The presence of this creek suggested some potential for prehistoric sites.
Historic maps were also examined during the file search to aid in assessing the potential for unrecorded historic
period cultural resource sites to be present within or near the project area. The 1929 Wharton, Texas U. S. Army
Corps of Engineers Tactical Map (Scale 1:125,000) did not show any houses, barns, or other structures in the
project area or vicinity. Likewise, the 1959 Garwood, Texas 7.5â USGS map did not show any such houses,
barns, or structures in the area. The potential for historic period sites was rated as low.
The field survey was conducted by the LCRA Cultural Resource staff on April 2, 2012. Mr. Randy Epps of
LCRAâs Garwood Irrigation District staff showed the staff the locations of the project elements in the field. The
survey of each area began with a pedestrian walk-over. During the pedestrian survey, bare patches of ground
surface and cutbanks of gullies and stream channels were inspected to determine if any cultural artifacts or
features were present. Similarly, disturbed soil adjacent to the irrigation canals was examined (Figure 173). In
particular, soil disturbances provided excellent visibility at the south end of the project area where two additional
pipes will be laid adjacent to an existing pipe to transfer the water from the small canal over ground surface into
the south end of the gravel pit (Figure 174). A subsurface exposure in a gully about midway across the proposed
pipeline route that will move water back into the canal from the lake also provided excellent subsurface visibility
(Figure 175, see Appendix for soil profile). A second channel cut further northward along this pipeline route
section near the south bank of the canal provides good exposures also. No cultural materials were found in any of
these areas despite detailed searches.
Elsewhere, shovel tests were dug to sample areas with poor ground surface. Shovel Tests 1 and 2 were excavated
in areas where the northern pipeline will be buried below ground surface. These shovel tests showed that
disturbed and/or introduced sand and clay fill that is undoubtedly related to gravel quarrying covers the original
ground surface down to depths of 18 to 34 cm (7 to 13 inches) below ground surface. Coarse pea-sized gravel
deposits with some larger fist-sized gravel were found below the introduced fill in Shovel Test 1 down to 100 cm
(39 inches), at which point the digging was terminated. In shovel test 2, mottled gray and reddish clay was
exposed down to a depth of 55 cm (22 inches). Since it appeared likely that this mottled clay also represented
disturbed fill material, the shovel test was ended at that depth.
Shovel Test 3 was excavated at the southwestern end of the project area in the corridor of the pipeline that will
carry water from the large canal to the smaller one. This shovel test was dug about midway between the two
canals in the hope of uncovering undisturbed deposits. However, the upper 25 cm (10 inches) proved to consist of
disturbed brown sandy loam that was mixed with yellow, orange and brown mottled clay that must come from the
excavation of the bottom part of the canals. From 25 to 45 cm (10 to 18 inches) below ground surface, the
original dark grayish-brown sandy loam topsoil was uncovered. The yellowish-brown clay B-horizon subsoil
appeared to begin at 45 cm (18 inches) below ground surface.
No cultural materials were found during any parts of the field survey investigations. Based on the results of the
fieldwork, it is recommended that the construction of the temporary water storage pilot project be allowed to
proceed without any restrictions. Because the area investigated for this state-level review was less than 5 acres in
size and no cultural resource sites were found, according to LCRAâs Memorandum of Understanding with the
Texas Historical Commission (THC) a report does not have to be sent to the THC at this time to obtain clearance
347

for the project construction. Instead, the project may proceed by virtue of this memo, and the survey results will
be reported to the THC next year in the LCRAâs Annual Report of Cultural Resource Investigations for Calendar
Year 2012.

Project 13.12 Cultural Resource Assessment for the Proposed Hydromet Relocation on Lake Austin
County: Travis
Type of Investigation: Field Survey
Date of Investigation: April 2012
The LCRA is planning to move an existing Hydromet station located on the south side of Lake Austin east of the
Loop 360 bridge to a new location upstream on the west side of the bridge (Figure 176). The new location is on
private property a few feet from the waterâs edge. The surrounding area has been cleared and covered with St.
Augustine grass. Several feet to the east of the proposed hydromet location, the landowner has installed an
electrical water pump. Electricity to power the hydromet will run from the pump via a 2-foot-long trench. The
deepest impact will come from the excavation of a foundation hole not more than 18 inches in diameter and 4 feet
deep. The concrete pad for the station will rest on the ground surface. The total area impacted will be less than 1
square meter (10 square feet).
The LCRAâs Cultural Resources conducted a survey of the new location by inspecting the ground in the
immediate area and digging a shovel test in the spot where the foundation will go. From information provided by
the landowner, the entire landform along the interior of the bend was built up from sediments deposited during
twentieth century floods. The shovel test appeared to support this assertion because loose sand was encountered
from just under the surface to the bottom of the test at 60 cm. At this point a mat of large tree roots was struck,
preventing further digging at that location. Because the area appears to be a recent point bar, further digging was
deemed unnecessary. The sand was screened for artifacts and none were recovered.
Because no archeological sites are located in the project area â and therefore no State Archeological Landmarks
(SALs) are present â the installation of the Hydromet at the new location can proceed by virtue of this memo.

Project 14.12 Cultural Resource Assessment for the Proposed Dredging off Terrace Lane on Lake
Buchanan
County: Llano
Type of Investigation: Field Survey
Date of Investigation: April 2012
A private landowner on the west side of Lake Buchanan wishes to remove loose sand and rock from LCRAowned lake bottom in front of his property (Figure 177). The proposed removal areas are located to the northwest
and south of his covered boat dock and together cover roughly 10,000 square feet. This material will then be
deposited on the lake bottom adjacent to the west side of his property.
On April 19, 2012, the LCRA Cultural Resources conducted a survey of the removal areas and the area where the
fill will be deposited. The proposed removal areas were found to be severely eroded by waves, leaving bare rock
and decomposed granite. The fill area was covered by a sand drift up to 3 feet thick. No intact soil was seen on
the lake bottom along the outer edge of this drift. No artifacts were seen in the proposed dredging and fill areas.
Because the proposed dredging and fill areas contain no archeological sites and cover less than 5 acres, then
according to the LCRAâs MOU with the Texas Historical Commission (THC), a report does not have to be sent to
the THC for a 30-day review/comment period. Instead, the dredging by the landowner can proceed without
further oversight by the Cultural Resource Services staff.

Date of Investigation: April 2012
The LCRA is planning to build a new low-water boat ramp on the lakebed north of Shaw Island Road on the Lake
Buchanan shoreline in Llano County (Figure 178, Figure 179). The ramp will be about 100 feet long and 12 feet
wide. The footings that will run around ramp will be 24 inches deep and 12 inches wide.
On April 26, 2012, the LCRA Cultural Resources conducted a survey of the area where the ramp will be built.
The entire area was found to be severely eroded by waves leaving frequent exposures of bedrock partially covered
by sand drifts. A shovel test encountered loose sand over a gravely clay subsoil, indicating the upper soil zone
has eroded away with sand and gravel subsequently deposited by waves. No artifacts were seen on the surface or
recovered from the shovel test fill.
On leaving the project area, the survey crew noticed prehistoric artifacts on either side of a small portion of the
truck path that runs in a northerly direction from Shaw Island Road. To avoid any impacts to this archeological
site during the ramp construction, heavy machinery should use the alternative route to the project area shown as a
dashed red line in Figure 1. This alternative route is a well-defined truck path that runs northwest on the lake bed
along the full-pool shoreline. At a point about 900 feet from the entrance off Shaw Island Road, this path veers to
the east toward the proposed boat ramp site.
Because the proposed construction area contains no archeological sites and covers less than 5 acres, then
according to the LCRAâs MOU with the Texas Historical Commission (THC), a report does not have to be sent to
the THC for a 30-day review/comment period. Instead, construction of the boat ramp can proceed without further
oversight by the Cultural Resource Services staff.

Project 16.12 Cultural Resource Assessment for the Proposed Ridge Harbor Wastewater System
Dosing Bed Expansion
County: Burnet
Type of Investigation: Field Survey
Date of Investigation: April 2012
The LCRA is planning to construct four new dosing beds at the Ridge Harbor water treatment plant in Burnet
County (Figure 180). These will be located in the southwest corner of the tract on approximately 0.95 acre.
Because this particular area looked undisturbed on a recent aerial photographand because prehistoric artifacts
were noted on a previous project at the Ridge Harbor plant, the LCRAâs Cultural Resources decided to conduct an
archeological survey before construction of the dosing beds began.
The survey was done on April 27, 2012. The entire project area was walked over and exposed ground surfaces
were inspected for artifacts. One shovel test was dug on the western edge of the project area where ground
visibility was poor.
The survey found no artifacts on the surface and none were recovered from the shovel test. The entire project
area appeared to have been graded with no evidence of top soil. Oak trees, which are common on the adjacent
private land, were not seen in the project area, only cedar trees, small mesquite trees, and poverty weed,
vegetation which probably took hold after the clearing and blading. A large berm runs through the project area
northeast to southwest.
Because the proposed construction area contains no archeological sites and covers less than five acres, then
according to the LCRAâs MOU with the Texas Historical Commission (THC), a report does not have to be sent to
the THC for a 30-day review/comment period. Instead, construction of the dosing beds can proceed without
further oversight by the Cultural Resource Services staff.

Project 20.12 Cultural Resource Assessment for the Proposed T-548 Lone Star Tap Transmission Line
Overhaul Project
County: Colorado
Type of Investigation: Field Survey
Date of Investigation: May 2012
INTRODUCTION
LCRA, as part of the ongoing T-548 Eagle Lake-to-El Campo transmission line project, needs to conduct
additional ground disturbance along a 4.3-mile-long tap line in Colorado County that runs from an existing small
substation owned by American Electric Power to the main portion of T-548. The project was originally reviewed
a part of the T-548 rebuild, (Malof and Prikryl 2011), and originally was only going to consist of replacing bad
wood on the existing wooden H-frame structures, and if the actual supports required replacement, then new poles
would be placed in the exact location of the old supports. It was subsequently determined that such an approach
was not feasible, and that when both supports of an H-frame required replacement then the entire structure would
be moved a distance of approximately 10 feet to a new location that would be determined by engineers working in
the field. Of 40 total structures along the tap line, 27 required movement (Figure 181).
After a review of local conditions such as soil and geology, it was determined that a field assessment was
necessary. Because the project area totaled just over 5 acres, a cultural resources survey normally would require a
full report and THC review under LCRAâs annual blanket TAC permit prior to commencement of construction.
Given the tight construction schedule, however, THC agreed to allow the assessment to be conducted without the
standard 30-day review and instead be included in LCRAâs annual report of cultural resource investigations as
otherwise described in the Memorandum of Understanding between THC and LCRA. This agreement followed a
review by THC of LCRAâs proposed research strategy and work plan, including specific high-probability areas.
Presence of potentially significant cultural resources would require additional consultation with THC.
Work was conducted during the week of May 14, 2012. Given the nature of the project area, which consists of
potentially deep clay soils in Holocene alluvium, a skidsteer with an auger attachment was used to allow
consistent testing of soils. Standard shovel testing was also employed when equipment access was not possible.
Sixteen subsurface tests were excavated, exceeding minimum survey standards. No archaeological sites were
identified and no artifacts were collected.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

The Lone Star Tap line is located on the eastern bank of the Colorado River just north of the Garwood
community. It is entirely within mapped Holecene-aged alluvium. Soils are described primarily as

362

Figure 181. Lone Star Tap project location on Garwood and Bonus USGS scaled imagery.

363

Brazoria clay, a vertisol that has a 20-inch A horizon over a succession of B horizons. This is the primary soil
along the transmission line and for the most part, fills the landform east of the line and into the broad agricultural
fields present in that direction.. However, these soils start breaking into smaller groups of Entisols and Alfisols,
including Norwood silty clay loam, Mohat loam and Clemville silty clay (another Vertisol) under and
immediately west of the main portion of the tap toward the river, indicating a more complex depositional history.
At the far southern portion of the line, soils are unmapped but a large sand and gravel quarry is present at that
location. Other recent land use has been for crops and pasture. An artificial berm, created for flood control
according to a local farmer and visible on topographic maps as channelized water courses, parallels much of the
transmission line.

RESULTS

No archaeological sites were documented during the investigation. A buried feature consisting of burned clay,
charcoal and ash was encountered, but intensive subsurface testing and subsequent matrix flotation and fine
screening failed to find any artifacts, and the feature is almost certainly the result of a past natural event.
Regardless, the replacement structure will be placed on the opposite side of the existing structure and thus avoid
the feature.
Sixteen subsurface tests were excavated. These were all placed at structures considered to be in high-probability
areas except for test 12, located at STR 37/1, due to its location near a high-probability area and within Norwood
soils which may have a buried A horizon. In general, subsurface tests were very similar in profile, consisting of
brown to grayish-brown clay that often became increasingly blocky or exhibited slickensides and increased
mottling with depth. Shovel test data is presented in the table below.

STR 38/9
Test 1 was placed at the high-probability structure farthest to the south (STR 38/9), located on the edge of a relict
meander (Figure 182, Figure 183). At 30 cm below the surface it encountered the burned clay, ash and charcoal
mentioned above. After the test was documented it was given further consideration. Originally interpreted as the
result of past land clearing, especially given the lack of any artifacts, the presence of a capping layer of apparently
undisturbed soil called that interpretation into question. A hypothesis stating that past land-clearing activities
would result in widespread distribution of burned materials across a similar subsurface elevation was therefore
tested. Five additional tests (3-7) were excavated with only one, test 6, recovering burned material. None of the
tests recovered any artifacts.
Test 1 was then re-excavated in order to more carefully document it (Figure 184). The portion of the feature that
was profiled began at 23 cm below the surface and consisted of 13 cm of scattered blackened clay and a small
amount of charcoal grading to red oxidized clay. Below this was 20 cm of red oxidized clay and ash, with most
of the ash toward the bottom of the feature, at a final depth of about 60 cm. The feature profile was sloping, with
the oxidized clay dipping to the west and enveloping the ashy deposit. The feature was not visible in the northern
one-third or so of the test hole, indicating it was only the northern portion of the feature that was present. Below
the feature, the clay was essentially identical to that above.
364

In order to better understand the feature, an approximate 10 x 20 cm column sample was collected for laboratory
water screening and flotation. A 3-liter volume of soil matrix from within the feature was floated to recover
charcoal and bone (light fraction) and lithics (heavy fraction). The sample was first

Figure 182. Location of feature at STR 38/9.

dried and then large clods broken up into pieces less than 2 centimeters across. The flotation apparatus consisted
of a 10-gallon plastic tub filled with clean water. A 1.5 mm mesh colander was suspended in the water with its
rim above the surface to catch the heavy fraction.
The sample was floated in roughly 500 cc batches. Each batch was poured into the suspended colander which
was then agitated by hand to help break up and melt the clods. A small 0.5 mm mesh strainer was then used to
skim the water surface to collect the floating debris (light fraction). The collected material was then shaken onto
newspaper and the process continued until all suspended material was collected.
365

The heavy fraction that collected in the bottom of the colander was then stirred by hand to further break up any
remaining clods and the skimming for the light fraction resumed. This process continued until the clods could no
longer be reduced in size. The colander was then removed from the tub, allowed to drain,

Figure 183. Testing at STR 38/9.

Figure 184. Feature following matrix collection.

and the contents shaken onto a separate newspaper to dry. The entire process was repeated for each 500 cc batch.
After two batches were floated, the tub would be emptied out and refilled with fresh water to prevent clay buildup
on the samples. Once all the batches had been floated, the light and heavy fractions were allowed to dry on
newspapers overnight.
366

When dried, the total light fraction weighed approximately 1.5 grams and consisted mostly of uncharred fine roots
and a small amount of charcoal flecks. The largest charcoal fragment was about 2 cm long and 2 mm thick,
apparently from a small twig, but most of the fragments were blocky and measured less than 0.5 cm in greatest
dimension. The heavy fraction, not quite dry, weighed about 750 grams and consisted of brown clay clods
averaging about 0.5 cm in size and a small amount of burned clay fragments, reddish in color and fired high
enough not to break up in water. There were also a few snail shell fragments in the heavy fraction. No obvious
cultural material such as chert flakes or metal fragments was recovered during the flotation process.
Given the appearance of the feature and the lack of artifacts, it is at present considered to represent a natural fire
event, most likely a tree root that burned below a past surface. Apparent developed soil above the feature
suggests this event occurred a relatively long time ago. Despite not being considered a cultural feature, and
therefore not an archaeological site, the location was communicated to project engineers and construction
personnel, and the replacement structure will be located to the west of the structure where test 7 was placed, thus
avoiding the feature.

Other Areas
Most of the remainder of the project area is self-explanatory by examination of the shovel test data that describes
the consistent clays that were encountered (Figure 185, Figure 186). The area to the west of the oxbow begs
additional explanation, however. Coming out of the Lone Star Substation the line is within an active quarry
and/or quarry spoils. Replacement structure STR 39/4 is clearly within an area of past disturbance, based on the
USGS map. Non-replacement structure 38/3 is alongside the expanded quarry and any future projects should be
able to safely ignore this location. Structures 38/2 and 38/1 are both along a very high, meandering berm not
visible on the USGS quad but possibly visible on aerial imagery. It roughly follows the contour of the low hill in
that area. Structure 38/2 was present before the berm was completed, based on an approximate 3-foot-deep
depression at that location. Structure 38/1 does not have the same type of depression but is clearly along the same
landform. No subsurface testing was conducted in this area.

Summary and Recommendations
The Lone Star Tap rebuild project was assessed for archaeological sites. None was found. An enigmatic buried
feature containing burned clay, ash and some charcoal has no associated artifacts, and is considered to be the
result of a natural event. Regardless, the feature will be avoided during construction activities. If unexpected
buried cultural materials are discovered during construction then ground disturbance should cease in the area of
the discovery until it can be assessed by qualified archaeologists. The project is now reported to the THC within
this annual report.

Project 23.12 Cultural Resource Assessment for the Proposed T-227 Maintenance Project
County: Comal and Hays
Type of Investigation: File Search
Date of Investigation: June 2012
LCRA proposes to conduct standard maintenance on transmission line T-227 between the Hays Energy and Zorn
substations in Hays and Comal counties (Figure 188). There are no known avoidance areas on the described line.
For reference purposes, previously recorded site 41HY300 is located within the ROW on the edge of the stable
terrace edge overlooking a private reservoir to the east. It is between 250 and 400 feet east of STR 1. The site
was originally recorded in 1998 for a private transmission line project and was felt to be potentially significant.
Subsequent work by LCRA for an upgrade of T-204/205 resulted in the site being reassessed as not significant
within the ROW shared with or parallel with T-227. There are therefore no avoidance or other constraints within
the ROW. However, because the site was not evaluated outside of the ROW there should be no ground
disturbance outside the existing corridor.

Project 24.12 Cultural Resource Assessment for the Proposed Turnersville-to-Buda (T-380) TL
Maintenance Project
County: Hays
Type of Investigation: File Search
Date of Investigation: June 2012
A file search was done by the LCRAâs Cultural Resource Services staff for the upcoming T-380 Turnersville-toBuda maintenance project (Figure 189). No records were found showing that this line has been investigated for
cultural resources. No archeological sites have been recorded within the T-380 corridor.
The T-380 line runs through a portion of the Blackland prairie without perennial streams. Such areas are known
to have a low probability for prehistoric archeological sites. Historic farmstead sites have been recorded on
hilltops in the immediate area. Similar elevations crossed by T-380 are mostly covered by modern construction
and any archeological sites there would have already been destroyed.
Because of the low probability of archeological sites in the T-380 corridor, the upcoming maintenance project can
proceed without special conditions as long as standard emergency provisions are in place. If work crews uncover
buried archeological material, work should stop in the immediate area of the find and the LCRA Cultural
Resource Services staff notified.

Project 25.12 Cultural Resource Assessment for the Proposed Zorn-to-Comfort (T-389) TL
Maintenance
County: Guadalupe, Hays, Comal and Kendall
Type of Investigation: File Search
Date of Investigation: June 2012
A file search was done by the LCRAâs Cultural Resource Services staff for the upcoming T-389 Zorn-to-Comfort
maintenance project (Figure 190, Figure 191, Figure 192, Figure 193). The file search found that the line was
surveyed for cultural resources in 1982 by the Texas Archeological Survey of the University of Texas prior to its
construction by the LCRA. The survey resulted in the recording of 21 prehistoric sites and two historic sites.
Three of these sites were considered potentially significant: 41KE86, 41KE88, and 41CM157. These sites will
need to be avoided during the upcoming maintenance project.
Site 41KE86 is a prehistoric campsite located in an open field on the east side of an unnamed tributary creek of
the Guadalupe River. Structure 248 lies about 80 feet east of the creek probably within the site area. The site
contains a large burned rock midden â a low mound of fire-cracked limestone rocks 75 meters (246 feet) in
diameter. When the site was recorded, boulders had been placed on the midden by the landowner to protect it.
The segment of the T-389 ROW corridor that needs to be avoided runs from the creek eastwards to a point 300
feet east of Structure 248, a total length of approximately 380 feet. Clearing can only be done by hand or with a
Seppi or other mechanical means that do not disturb the soil. Heavy vehicles need to avoid this section of
corridor after rains when the ground is wet to avoid rutting.
Site 41KE88 is a prehistoric campsite located in a field on the west side of Little Joshua Creek. Although
plowing has caused some damage, the recorders thought that most of the siteâs buried cultural deposits were
intact. The segment of the T-389 ROW corridor that needs to be avoided lies between Structure 235 and a point
1,000 feet to the west. The avoidance measures described for 41KE86 apply to this site as well.
Site 41CM157 is a historic farmstead located on the west terrace of York Creek. The site contains a late 19th
century vernacular German house, a log outbuilding, and a well. Buried cultural deposits are also presumed to be
present. The section of the T-389 ROW corridor to be avoided lies between a point 100 feet east of Structure 23
and a point 400 feet west of this structure, a total length of 500 feet. The same avoidance measures for 41KE86
apply to this site as well.
In 2004, LCRA archeologists surveyed a segment of the T-389 line shared with T-204 and T-205 between Hays
Energy and a point just east of IH 35. No significant sites were recorded within this segment, but one previously
recorded site, 41HY298, the former location of the Berry Durham School, has an area outside the corridor that
requires special restrictions. This sensitive area extends from County Road 265 eastward for a distance of about
180 feet. From the north edge of the T-389 ROW the sensitive area extends for a distance of 147 feet northward to
the edge of a gravel road. The location of 41HY298 lies in the vicinity of Structure 12. All clearing and
maintenance activities may proceed within the ROW corridor at 41HY298. However, should any maintenance and
clearing activities require approaching the ROW corridor from areas outside of the existing T-389 ROW in the
375

vicinity of Structure 12, then the area on the south side of the ROW should be utilized rather than the north side to
avoid damaging potentially significant archeological deposits associated with 41HY298.
While these are the only recorded archeological sites that need to be avoided during the T-389 maintenance
project, other undetected sites might still be present. Therefore, standard emergency provisions still need to be
followed. If work crews uncover buried archeological material, work should stop in the immediate area of the
find and the LCRA Cultural Resource Services staff notified.

Project 26.12 Cultural Resource Assessment for the Proposed Turnersville-to-Goforth (T-272) TL
Maintenance Project
County: Hays
Type of Investigation: File Search
Date of Investigation: July 2012
Later this summer, the LCRA is planning routine enhancement of their T-272 TL from Turnersville-to-Goforth
(Figure 194). A file search was done by the LCRAâs Cultural Resource Services staff, which found that this TL
corridor has not been surveyed for cultural resources. A review of the pertinent USGS topographic maps showed
that the line runs through upland portions of the Blackland Prairie, crossing the upper courses of three small
creeks. From north to south, these creeks are Brushy Creek, Porter Creek, and Bunton Branch.
Archeological sites, especially significant archeological sites, are rarely found along such minor drainages in the
Blackland Prairie, probably because of the lack of reliable water and other resources such as flint for making tools
and surface rocks used to construct cooking hearths.
Because T-272 runs through areas with a low probability for archeological sites, no special restrictions are needed
for the upcoming enhancement project. However, standard emergency provisions still need to be followed. If
work crews uncover buried archeological material, work should stop in the immediate area of the find and the
LCRA Cultural Resource Services staff notified.

Project 28.12 Cultural Resource Assessment for the Proposed Pedernales River Park Camp Host
Relocation
County: Blanco
Type of Investigation: File Search
Date of Investigation: December 2012
The LCRA is planning improvements to the Pedernales River Nature Park involving the relocation of the existing
camp host site from outside the park fence to a new location within the park (Figure 195). The project will also
involve the removal of asphalt pavement and a fence associated with the existing camp host site, as well as a pipe
fence and other asphalt pavement located along Hwy 281 south of Davis Drive, the street that leads into the park.
In these areas, non-native plants will be replaced with native species. A new entrance gate and sign will also be
built immediately east of the existing camp host site.
The proposed camp host site is located within the park in an area previously surveyed for cultural resources by the
LCRA Cultural Resource Services staff. No cultural resources sites will be affected by this construction. The
area between the park fence and Hwy 281 from the south edge of Davis Drive northwards was surveyed by
Cultural Resource Services staff in 2011 for the restaurant demolition project and no cultural resources sites were
found there as well.
The only area of this project that has not previously been surveyed for cultural resources lies south of Davis Drive
between the park fence and the highway. Therefore, Cultural Resource Services staff conducted a field survey
there on December 13, 2012. The survey involved walking over the areas where the fences and pavements will be
removed and inspecting the ground surface for artifacts. In addition, three shovel tests were dug in areas where
the soil appeared undisturbed. No artifacts were recovered from these tests and none were seen on the surface.
To summarize, Cultural Resource Services staff has surveyed all the areas that will be impacted by this project.
Since no cultural resources sites were recorded in these areas, the project can proceed.

Project 30.12 Cultural Resources Desktop Review for LCRAâs Proposed T-126 Overhaul Project
County: Gillespie
Type of Investigation: File Search
Date of Investigation: September 2012
LCRA Cultural Reosurce Services staff has completed a cultural resources desktop review for the proposed FY13
overhaul of the T-126 Transmission Line, which is also known as the Eckert-to-Nebo Transmission Line. The
transmission line extends for a length of just 0.7 mile in Gillespie County (Figure 196).
A file search showed that there are no previously recorded cultural resource sites in this transmission-line right of
way. The file search also indicated that the LCRA Cultural Resource staff had conducted a desktop cultural
resource review for this line in 2007 prior to a maintenance project. At that time, the staff had concluded that the
line appeared to have a low probability for having any unrecorded sites. The Texas Historical Commission
concurred with this recommendation during their review of LCRAâs Annual Report for Calendar Year 2007.
Based on the results of the file search, the proposed overhaul project may proceed without any cultural resource
field investigation. However, standard emergency discovery provisions are always applicable. Should the
personnel conducting the work uncover any presently unknown buried archaeological materials during
construction, then work should cease in the immediate area of the discovery and the LCRA Cultural Reosurce
Services staff should be contacted at ext. 6714 or 2753 so that the find can be reported to the Texas Historical
Commission and a determination can be made as to whether any avoidance/mitigation measures are needed.

Project 31.12 Cultural Resource Assessment for the Proposed Goforth-to-Rohr-to-Canyon (T-490) TL
Enhancement
County: Hays
Type of Investigation: File Search
Date of Investigation: September 2012
The LCRA is planning routine clearing and maintenance on T-490 which runs for 6.96 miles in Hays County
(Figure 197). Only one small area along this line was of concern to the LCRAâs Cultural Resource Services staff.
This was where the line crosses the south bank of Plum Creek east of Kyle. This creek is large enough to have a
high probability for prehistoric archeological sites, yet small enough that vehicles could cross. Archeological
sites are more likely to be on the south side of the creek because that side is more elevated than the north.
Cultural Resource Services staff conducted a field survey of the south side of Plum Creek on September 25, 2012.
The area was found to be heavily overgrown by tall ragweed and scattered acacia brush with an inactivated
electric fence running parallel to the creek. Between this fence and the creek channel is a low terrace with a City
of Austin sewer manhole and a presumed buried sewer pipeline. No creek crossing for vehicles was seen within
or near the transmission ROW, and such a crossing might not be possible because of the depth of the Plum Creek
channel. A dirt road running parallel to the creek on the low terrace provided good ground visibility. A shovel
test was placed further upslope south of the electric fence to see if buried artifacts are present. No artifacts were
recovered from this test and no artifacts were seen on the surface on the south side of the creek.
Since no archeological sites are present on the south side of Plum Creek, the maintenance crews can proceed with
brush clearing in that area as well as in the rest of the T-490 ROW. However, standard emergency provisions still
need to be followed. If work crews uncover buried archeological features, work should stop in the immediate area
of the find and the LCRA Cultural Resource Services staff notified.

Project 33.12 Cultural Resource Assessment for T-207 Transmission Line Overhaul Project
County: Gillespie and Kerr
Type of Investigation: File Search
Date of Investigation: October 2012
LCRA proposes to conduct an overhaul of transmission line T-207 between the Gillespie and Kerrville Stadium
substations in Gillespie and Kerr counties (Figure 198). The project will consist, among other things, of replacing
selected structures. Replacement structures will go into newly excavated foundations very near the location of the
existing structures. Because the project requires new ground disturbance, a cultural resources assessment was
conducted by LCRA Cultural Resource Services staff during September and October of 2012. The assessment
consisted of a map and file review followed by a field survey of specifically identified locations.
The map and file review demonstrated that the transmission line had been assessed for cultural resources in 2007
in advance of a maintenance project. That project resulted in the recording of nine previously unknown
archaeological sites. Because maintenance surveys are conducted at a scale appropriate for the anticipated level
of disturbance, not all areas were surveyed at the time, and some areas were only briefly assessed. For the present
overhaul, the list of structures to be replaced was compared with locations that had been identified during
maintenance activities as requiring new or additional assessment if new construction impacts became imminent.
These locations were identified as the north side of Live Oak Creek (STR 3/6), the Delaware Creek area (STR
11/7) and canyon heads in the Kerrville area (STRs 22/1, 21/6, 21/4, 21/1, 20/4).
Four previously undocumented prehistoric archaeological sites, 41GL450-453, were recorded as a result of the
field work. None of the sites will require any avoidance or other measures in respect to the present project.
Sites 41GL450 and 41GL451 are a pair of prehistoric open campsites located on the north side of Live Oak
Creek, just south of the U.S. Hwy 290 crossing. Site 41GL450 was observed as having its southern edge at STR
3/5, where a shovel test recovered a flake and a chip in 40 cm of sandy loam matrix that terminated in a zone of
sandy gravels (Figure 199). In order to define the site boundaries and determine if any travel restrictions might be
necessary, another shovel test was placed about 75 meters northeast at the edge of the pasture next to the plowed
field. A total of nine pieces of debitage was recovered from 100 cm of sandy loam soil, and there was no
indication that subsoil was encountered. The site was seen to extend outside the ROW within the plowed field
and pasture. Artifact density is moderate and includes at least one tool, a thin biface that was severely burned.
The site's location within mapped Holocene alluvial deposits on a stable terrace above Live Oak Creek suggests
the potential for intact buried cultural materials. Due to ranching and farming activities, the surface of the site is
clearly disturbed and the present project will not negatively impact it. The location of the replacement structure is
in relatively shallow soils with few artifacts and no suggestion of buried features. Should the location of structure
3/6 move significantly in the future then additional investigations are warranted.

Figure 199. Site 41GL450, looking southwest from pasture edge toward STR 3/6 and Live Oak Creek.

Site 41GL451 is very similar in observed materials and contains burned rock and stone tool debris across the
plowed field and pasture (Figure 200). It is separated from 41GL450 by a low, clayey soil-filled swale where
cultural material is no longer present. The site is centered about 200 meters northeast of 41GL450 and STR 3/5 is
at about the observed site center. The site was recorded due to obvious cultural materials seen in the ROW in an
area where equipment will presumably be traveling. Because the structure will not be replaced, no shovel tests
were excavated. The site is on the edge of mapped Holocene alluvium and is on the next terrace edge above
41GL450. Due to its presence in previously disturbed pasture and agricultural fields, there is no need for any type
of avoidance at this time. Future projects that include new ground disturbance should consider additional
investigations at this location.
Sites 41GL452 and 41GL453 are lithic procurement sites located in the Delaware Creek vicinity. Site 41GL452
is at STR 11/7 and extends for about 60 meters on either side of the structure (Figure 201). It consists of dense to
moderately dense numbers of artifacts within a deposit of fair to high quality tabular chert resting on limestone
bedrock and caliche. The setting is rolling, open range. Because chert is no longer a constituent of the bedrock
geology, these ancient lag deposits would have been of high importance as for prehistoric peoples. Structured
procurement is evident in the form of large bifaces (Figure 202), which would have been an ideal form of a
portable resource. While the site is valuable for it locational information, and certain research designs could
extract additional information, the type of site is not one that normally would qualify for State Archeological
Landmark status, and this site is not felt to warrant such a listing. There are therefore no recommendations for
any type of avoidance, now or in the future.

391

Figure 200. Site 41GL451, looking southwest toward 41GL450.

Site 41GL453 is a lithic procurement site that is very similar to 41GL452. It was observed while traveling to the
location of STR 11/7. It is located across the end of a rocky lobe, part of a ridge system overlooking Delaware
Creek in open rangeland. Like 41GL452, it contains large cores, a few bifaces and numerous flakes within a lag
deposit of tabular chert. As with 41GL452, there is no reason to avoid the site, although the site could add
information to a study of resource acquisition locales or generalized settlement patterning. The site is not
considered to be SAL eligible.
The canyon heads in the Kerrville area were spot checked. The presence of several springs in the area increases
the possibility of significant prehistoric sites in such settings. Structures 22/1, 21/6, and 21/1 were directly
examined. The general setting is in highly disturbed and bulldozed ROW in very shallow, rocky soils. The
potential for there to be intact archaeological sites at any remaining structures in this setting is nearly impossible.
There are no restrictions for this area.

In summary, four previously unrecorded archaeological sites were identified and assessed during the project.
These were in locations where new, replacement structures will be placed in new foundation holes. None of the
sites require any type of avoidance for the present project. Sites 41GL450 and 41GL451 are of unknown
eligibility for SAL status and should be further investigated if new disturbance becomes imminent. Sites
41GL452 and 41GL453 are considered to be ineligible for SAL status and no further work or avoidance is
necessary.

Project 34.12 Cultural Resource Assessment for T-267 Transmission Line Overhaul Project
County: Llano
Type of Investigation: File Search
Date of Investigation: October 2012
The LCRA Transmission Services is planning to overhaul their T-267 Transmission line that runs from CTEC
Buchanan Dam to the Pitsburg Substation in Llano (Figure 203). The project will involve the replacement of
some of the existing H-frame structures with new ones. Two of the structures slated for replacement lie within
the boundaries of potentially significant archeological sites: Structure 10/4 lies at the western limits of 41LL517, a
prehistoric campsite, and Structure 13/2 lies at the eastern limits of 41LL519, a prehistoric site that might contain
buried hearth features. Because the pole replacement will require the excavation of new holes near the existing
structures, any buried archeological deposits could be disturbed. On October 3 2012, contracted workers from the
LCRAâs Cultural Resource Services staff made a field visit to the two sites to determine if cultural deposits exist
in the immediate areas of 10/4 and 13/2 and, if so, assess their importance.
Four shovel tests were placed between two and 25 feet from each structure. The tests involved digging a circular
hole 18 inches in diameter and systematically screening the fill to recover any artifacts. At STR 10/4 on the edge
of site 41LL517, three of these tests recovered one to two pieces of prehistoric flint chipping debris each, mostly
in the upper 1 foot of soil, while the fourth test recovered no artifacts. No features or burned rocks (which would
suggest nearby hearths) were recovered. These findings show that cultural deposits are indeed present but they
lack significance. At 13/2 on the edge of 41LL519, the four shovel tests failed to recover any artifacts. It would
appear that cultural deposits are not present in the vicinity of the structure, and probably lie some distance - 25 or
more feet - to the west.
To summarize, cultural deposits exist in the soil around Structure 10/4, but these are not archeologically
significant, while at 13/2, no archeological deposits are present. Therefore, the pole replacement project can
proceed without further oversight from the LCRAâs Cultural Resource Services staff. However, potentially
significant cultural deposits are present beginning about 25 feet east of Structure 10/4, and continuing eastward
for 300 feet. Within this area, vehicles should remain on the existing access road.

Project 35.12 Cultural Resource Assessment for the T-106 Overhaul Project
County: Llano
Type of Investigation: File Search
Date of Investigation: October 2012
LCRA proposes to overhaul existing transmission line T-106 (Figure 204). The project will consist of replacing
worn components on various support structures. A single structure, STR 1/5, is scheduled to be replaced.
LCRA Cultural Resource Services staff conducted a map and file review prior to construction activities. It was
determined that the transmission line was surveyed in 2010 by LCRA in advance of enhancement/maintenance
activities. The survey consisted of an examination of all high probability stream crossings. Two prehistoric
archaeological sites, 41LL521 and 41LL522, were recorded. These were both lithic scatters that were not
considered eligible for State Archaeological Landmark status. The Texas Historical Commission concurred with
these recommendations by way of accepting the annual report in which the survey was reported.
Because the present project will only result in the replacement of a single structure located on a high lobe in a
low-probability area, no construction constraints are necessary in that area. Elsewhere, no significant ground
disturbance is expected, and the previous investigation did not identify any areas where any type of avoidance
was necessary.
LCRA Cultural Resource Services staff therefore has no need to conduct any type of oversight or post
construction inspection for this project.

Project 36.12 Cultural Resource Assessment for the T-131/379 Overhaul Project
County: Gillespie
Type of Investigation: File Search
Date of Investigation: October 2012
LCRA proposes to conduct overhaul activities on transmission lines T-131 and T-379 between the
Fredericksburg, Gillespie and CTEC Live Oak substations in Gillespie County (Figure 205). The total length of
the line, which is double circuited for almost its entirety, is approximately one mile.
A cultural resource assessment consisting of a map and file review was conducted by LCRA Cultural Resource
Services staff in October, 2012. It was determined that this transmission line has never been surveyed for cultural
resources, except for a short section near the Gillespie substation where T-266 runs parallel.
It is the understanding of Cultural Resource Services staff that seven structures (23/1, 23/4, 24/1, 24/5, 24/7, 24/8
and 24/9) are being replaced, but will be going within the exact same holes from which the old structures will be
removed. Therefore, no significant new ground disturbance is anticipated.
There are two locations within the project area that are considered to have a high probability for unrecorded
archaeological sites. These are at Barons Creek between STRs 23/7 and 24/1, and at Winfried Creek and its
tributary between STRs 22/7 and 23/1. Note that STRs 23/1 and 24/1 are scheduled for replacement.
As long as these or any other structures within the Barons Creek and Winfried Creek areas are replaced within the
exact same locations, and there is no significant ground disturbance in these areas, then there is no need for any
other cultural resource review. If the scope of the project changes to include new or significant ground
disturbance then LCRA Cultural Resource Services staff should be contacted in order to determine if additional
review is needed.

Project 37.12 Cultural Resource Assessment for the T-130 Overhaul Project
County: Gillespie
Type of Investigation: File Search
Date of Investigation: October 2012
LCRA proposes to conduct an overhaul of a 13.3-mile-long portion of transmission line T-130 that runs between
the Gillespie and Eckert substations in Gillespie County (Figure 206). At least 45 support structures are
scheduled to be replaced with new H-frames being widened from approximately 10 feet apart to 14 feet apart.
Replacement structures will generally be put within 2-10 feet of existing structures. There will therefore be new
ground disturbance associated with this project.
A cultural resources assessment was conducted by LCRA Cultural Resource Services staff. The assessment
consisted of a map and file review. It was determined that the Gillespie-to-Eckert portion of T-130 was surveyed
for cultural resources in 2007, prior to maintenance activities. A total of 12 archaeological sites were revisited
(41GL279, 41GL280) and recorded (41GL382-41GL391). Of these sites, four, 41GL382, 41GL386, 41GL387
and 41GL390, were recommended for additional work if new or significant ground disturbance was to occur
within them, or in the case of 41GL387, within the ROW to the northeast.
Structures within or near the sites recommended for avoidance are 10/9, 10/3, 8/4 and 6/2. Only STR 8/4 is
expected to be replaced, and it is located southwest of the boundary of 41GL287, in an area of low probability.
LCRA Cultural Resource Services staff therefore has no need to conduct additional cultural resource
investigations at this time. If, however, STRs 10/9, 10/3 or 6/2 require replacement, or if there is a need for
stream-crossing modifications, then the Cultural Resources department should be contacted so that appropriate
assessments can be conducted.

Project 38.12 Cultural Resource Assessment for the Gonzales-to-Cheapside (T-226) Transmission Line
Maintenance Project
County: Gonzales
Type of Investigation: File Search
Date of Investigation: October 2012
The LCRA Transmission Services is planning routine maintenance and clearing on their T-226 Transmission Line
which runs from the Gonzales Substation to the Cheapside Substation in Gonzales County (Figure 207). The T226 corridor was surveyed for cultural resources in 1982 by the Texas Archeological Survey, which was affiliated
with the University of Texas. Two potentially significant sites were recorded, 41GZ183 and 41GZ185, both
located southwest of the town of Gonzales.
Site 41GZ183 was described as a prehistoric short-term campsite and assessed as not meriting further
investigation due to perceived disturbances caused by burrowing animals and its location on the edge of the
ROW. The LCRAâs Cultural Resource Services staff considers the regulatory status of this site as unknown
because the original investigators conducted no subsurface testing. Therefore, for the upcoming maintenance
project, avoidance measures need to be taken. The site is located in the vicinity of Structure 38 on a slight rise
south of an unnamed tributary. This tributary appears run across the T-226 ROW 100 feet north of Structure 38.
Between this structure and the tributary, heavy vehicles should remain on the existing truck path. If no such path
exists, a single path should be established and used consistently. Within this area all vegetation should be cleared
by hand. A Seppi and other mechanical methods that do not disturb the ground are permissible as long as the
vehicles carrying the machinery remain on the existing truck path.
Site 41GZ185 was described as a 1930s-era house foundation situated outside the T-266 ROW. A hand-dug well
associated with the house is located within the ROW and needs to be avoided during the maintenance project.
The site is plotted 200 to 300 feet north of CR 292, which would place it somewhere near Structure 45. Work
crew should attempt to locate the well â in 1982 it was âenshroudedâ by a large mesquite tree â and hand-clear the
vegetation around the feature.
While 41GZ183 and 41GZ185 are the only recorded archeological sites in the T-226 corridor where avoidance
measures need to be taken, other undetected sites might still be present. Therefore, standard emergency
provisions still need to be followed. If work crews uncover buried archeological material, work should stop in the
immediate area of the find and the LCRA Cultural Resource Services staff notified.

Project 39.12 Cultural Resource Assessment for the Cheapside-to-Cuero (T-579) Transmission Line
Overhaul Project
County: Gonzales and DeWitt
Type of Investigation: File Search
Date of Investigation: October 2012
The LCRA Transmission Services Corporation is planning routine maintenance and clearing on their T-579
Transmission Line, which runs from the Cheapside Substation to the Cuero Substation. Most of the line lies in
DeWitt County except for the extreme northwest end which is in Gonzales County (Figure 208).
The T-579 corridor was surveyed for cultural resources in 1982 by the Texas Archeological Survey, which was
affiliated with the University of Texas. One potentially significant site was recorded, 41DW247, a prehistoric
quarry/workshop located on the right terrace of the Guadalupe River. Although subsequent test excavations
found shallow deposits with a limited variety of artifacts, the site was assessed as scientifically significant in part
because it represents one of the few surviving examples of this type of site in the immediate area. Avoidance by
vehicles and ground-disturbing clearing activities was recommended.
These avoidance measures for 41DW247 remain in place. The precise location of this site is in dispute but it
appears to lie between Structures 113 and 114. Within this section of corridor, heavy vehicles should remain on
the existing truck path. If no such path exists, a single path should be established and used consistently. Between
these structures, vegetation should be cleared by hand. A Seppi and other mechanical methods that do not disturb
the ground are permissible as long as the vehicles carrying the machinery remain on the existing truck path.
While 41DW247 is the only recorded archeological site that needs to be avoided during the T-579 maintenance
project, other undetected sites might still be present. Therefore, standard emergency provisions still need to be
followed. If work crews uncover buried archeological material, work should stop in the immediate area of the
find and the LCRA Cultural Resource Services staff notified.

Project 41.12 Cultural Resources Assessment of Proposed Muleshoe Bend â Ridge Harbor Boundary
Fence Project
County: Burnet
Type of Investigation: Field Survey
Date of Investigation: November, 2012
The LCRAâs Cultural Resource Services staff has completed a cultural resources assessment for the proposed
construction of a new fence along the boundary between LCRAâs Muleshoe Bend recreation Area and the Ridge
Harbor Subdivision (Figure 209, Figure 210). The fence will extend for a length of about 2,100 feet. Most of the
fence will be erected on a moderately steep slope that divides the riverâs alluvial terrace from the uplands. At the
west end of the proposed construction, the fence turns northward to extend for a length of about 500 feet down to
the 681 foot msl point that marks the Lake Travis conservation pool level. From the 681-foot line downward to
the current lakeshore edge exposed by the drought, a line of rock boulders may be installed in the future for a
length of about 450 feet to lakeshore edge. The purpose of the rock barrier is to help prevent park users from
accessing the private boat ramp in the area.
A file search conducted for the project showed there is a previously recorded archaeological site, 41BT344,
located on the alluvial terrace in the vicinity of the proposed fence and rock boulder alignment. However, most of
the site lies at least 200 feet west of the proposed fence and boulder alignment. Site 41BT344 is a potentially
significant cultural resource site that was recorded during a survey in 2000 for a secondary boat ramp for the
Ridge Harbor subdivision. The site includes a historic period component associated with the Hollingsworth family
whose name is seen at this location on house structures plotted on a 1936 contour map made by LCRA during the
construction of Mansfield Dam. Historic artifacts seen at the site include materials that could date as early as the
late nineteenth or very early twentieth century. The most noteworthy historic feature is a mostly filled-in
underground cistern. It appears that the house associated with the historic component was destroyed by the
construction of the original Ridge Harbor boat ramp.
Site 41BT344 also has a prehistoric component that appears to represent a North American Indian campsite with
burned rock-lined cooking and heating features, chipped stone tools and debitage, and grinding stones. There is
also evidence that river clams were being collected for food as indicated by high densities of river mussel shells
among the camp debris. Overall, the two components at 41BT344 were found to consist of scattered clusters of
cultural materials spread out from the area of the original boat ramp north and northeastward for a length of about
655 feet. The siteâs elevation extends from 660 to 680 foot ft msl. The site materials all lay on the west side of a
dirt road that extends from the original boat ramp to the proposed secondary ramp. The proposed secondary boat
ramp area was found to be located in between two of the artifact clusters where no damage would be done to the
site. Therefore, construction of the ramp was allowed to proceed.
On November 21, 2012, the LCRA Cultural Resource staff conducted a field survey of the currently proposed
fence project. During the field investigation, staff members walked transects across the area where the new
construction is being proposed. No archaeological materials were found on the portion of the fence alignment
located on the upland slope. Similarly, no artifacts were found on ground surface within the portion of the fence
that will extend through the alluvial terrace. Three shovel tests were excavated into the terrace to ensure that no
406

unknown buried portion of site 41BT344 extends into the fence area. The only artifact found in the shovel tests
was a rusted metal nail that is considered insignificant.
Additionally, the area where the rock boulders will be placed on ground surface was examined. The rock
alignment in the same vicinity as the secondary boat ramp, and as with the boat ramp, the rock alignment area was
found to be situated in between two of the artifact clusters. The laying of the rock alignment is approved with the
stipulation that trucks and other machinery that will lay the boulders should stay within 50 feet of the centerline
boulder alignment in the vicinity of the secondary boat ramp in order to avoid nearby archaeological deposits that
may be potentially significant (see Figure 209).
Aside from the stipulation described in the previous paragraph, all construction machinery should not stray into
areas west of the dirt road between the two boat ramps. Otherwise, all of the proposed construction may proceed.
Because the area investigated was less than five acres in size and no cultural resource sites will be impacted, a
report does not have to be sent to the Texas Historical Commission to obtain clearance for the project
construction. Instead, the project may proceed by virtue of this memo, and the survey results will be reported in
the LCRAâs Annual Report of Cultural Resource Investigations for Calendar Year 2012.

Letters to THC Requesting Clearance through File Searches

During calendar year 2012 there were three projects for which letters were sent to THC. Project 2.12 in DeWitt
County involved a substation owned by Guadalupe Valley Electric Co-op where the LCRA will construct several
A-frame poles and other equipment. Project 17.12 primarily dealt with new transmission line poles for the new
LCRA Ferguson Replacement Power Plant in Llano County. Project 32.12 involved post-construction monitoring
of new transmission line in Tom Green and Schleicher counties. The THC concurred in all these cases.

Project 2.12 Project Review under the Antiquities Code of Texas; LCRAâs Proposed Lost Creek
Substation and Transmission Line Tie-In Project
County: DeWitt
Type of Investigation: File search
Date of Investigation: January 2012
The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) is working with the Guadalupe Valley Electric Co-op (GVEC) on
the new Lost Creek Electrical Substation Project in DeWitt County, Texas (Figure 211). GVEC will own the
entire 5-acre sized substation tract and will construct the majority of the substation facilities. LCRA will
construct several A-frame transmission pole structures and install other equipment within the eastern edge of the
substation. As shown on Figure 1, the LCRA construction area in the substation is an approximately 0.68-acre
area.
LCRAâs other part of the project will consist of the construction of a new section of transmission line that will be
a tie-in line that extends from the existing LCRA T-541 transmission line northward for a distance of 377 feet to
the southeast edge of the substation. The new tie-in line will have a right-of-way (ROW) width of 60 ft. The tiein line will require the construction of a new transmission pole structure on the centerline of the existing T-541
transmission line between LCRAâs existing transmission pole structures 38/1 and 38/2.
Two additional
transmission pole structures will be erected within the tie-in line ROW adjacent to the eastern edge of the
substation.
A file search that was conducted for LCRAâs portion of the project indicated that there are no previously recorded
sites within LCRAâs proposed construction areas. The file search also showed that no portions of LCRAâs
proposed construction areas have ever been surveyed by professional archaeologists. The proposed project is
situated in an upland area with no water sources within 1,000 feet. Based on this fact, and a review of other
settlement pattern data for the region, it appears that the LCRA project area has a low probability for prehistoric
sites.
A check of the 1908 Cuero, Texas 15â USGS map and the 1960 Cuero, Texas 7.5â USGS map (photorevised in
1987) did not show any historic period houses or other buildings within or near the LCRA project area. A rural
house complex that is presently located immediately east of the LCRA substation area does not show on either of
the quad maps nor is it depicted on the aerial map dated to 1975 in the DeWitt County Soil Survey book. Thus,
this house complex must be less than 25 years in age and does not need to be recorded as a cultural resource site.
Given the results of the file searches, the LCRA Cultural Resource staff does not feel that LCRA proposed
construction for this project will have any effect on any cultural resources that are eligible or potentially eligible
for formal designation as State Archeological Landmarks. LCRA recommends that its portion of the construction
of its Lost Creek Substation and Transmission Line Tie-In Project be allowed to proceed with the understanding
that standard emergency discovery provisions are applicable.
We request your concurrence with our assessment and recommendations for this project.

recommendations for this project.

Project 17.12 Project Review under the State Antiquities Code and Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966 for LCRAâs Proposed Ferguson Replacement Plant Phase 2 Project
County: Llano
Type of Investigation: File search
Date of Investigation: July 2012
The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) is proposing to construct the Ferguson Replacement Phase 2
Transmission Line Project which will connect the new LCRA Ferguson Replacement Power Plant with the
nearby, existing LCRA Ferguson Electrical Substation. In addition to work within previously disturbed areas of
the substation grounds, the proposed project will involve the construction of three short electrical transmission
line segments that will each extend for an approximate length of 150 meters from the substation northward to
three locations within the south edge of the new replacement plant project area (Figure 212 and Figure 213). The
proposed transmission line construction will require the erection of transmission pole structures at the end points
of each of the three line segments. Additionally, single transmission pole structures, which are labeled STR 1-3
on Figure 213, will be constructed on each of the three line segments at locations between the north boundary of
the substation and the south terrace edge of an unnamed creek inlet.
A file search showed that there are no previously recorded cultural resource sites within the proposed construction
areas. The file search also indicated that LCRA had previously coordinated a cultural resource review under the
Texas Antiquities Code and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act for the proposed Ferguson
Replacement Power Plant Project with your agency and the Environmental Protection Agency in 2010 and 2011.
That review led to the conclusion that no State Archeological Landmark (SAL) or National Register (NR) eligible
sites were present in the Area of Potential Effect (APE).
The previous cultural resource review covered any archaeological concerns at the northern ends of the three
currently proposed transmission line segments. The previous review also took into consideration any visual
impacts to historic sites and landscapes, and all the currently proposed project is all within the previously
examined APE. Since all construction areas within the substation are previously disturbed, the principal concern
for the Phase 2 project from an archaeological standpoint is the area where STR 1-3 will be placed on the south
terrace edge of the creek inlet. Review of aerial maps, such as Figure 214 which dates to the time of the
construction of the original Ferguson Power Plant in the early 1970s, shows that this terrace area was very heavily
disturbed by construction activities. Since known cultural resource sites in this vicinity typically have average
depths of 30 to 50 cm, any cultural resource sites that were present would have been destroyed.
Given these facts, LCRA does not feel that the currently proposed transmission line construction for the Phase 2
Project has the potential to affect any cultural resource sites that are SAL and/or NR eligible. LCRA recommends
that the proposed Phase 2 construction be allowed to proceed without any further cultural resource investigations.
We request your concurrence with our assessment and recommendations for this project. As always, standard

Project 32.12 Results of post-construction monitoring, Twin Buttes-to-Big Hill (T-564) transmission
line project, Tom Green and Schleicher countries
County: Tom Green and Schleicher
Type of Investigation: File search
Date of Investigation: October 2012
On September 7, 2011, your office communicated final concurrence with findings and recommendations and the
completion of TAC Permit 5727 for LCRA's proposed Twin Buttes-to-Big Hill (T-564) 345-kilovolt transmission
line located in central Tom Green and northern Schleicher counties. Thirty-five archaeological sites were
recorded and two previously recorded archaeological sites were revisited during the survey of the 38-mile long
line. Of the 37 total sites, five, 41TG630, 41TG640, 41TG642, 41TG648, and 41TG660 were recommended for
avoidance. Sites 41TG640, a petroglyph site with mortar holes and a burned rock midden, and 41TG648, a buried
burned rock feature, were avoided through route modifications. Sites 41TG630, an open camp with organic
preservation, 41TG642, a large burned rock midden, and 41TG660, a hearth or oven complex creating an
incipient burned rock midden, were avoided through structures being placed outside the site areas and hand
clearing along with appropriate travel restrictions. These limitations were discussed with project personnel in
various ways, including on-site visits, throughout the construction process.
On September 26, 2012, LCRA Cultural Resource Services staff conducted site visits to the three avoidance sites
and documented successful avoidance at all three areas. This is discussed in more detail below, following the
documentation of newly recorded site 41TG663.
While traveling the ROW in the vicinity of 41TG660 a previously unrecorded archaeological site, assigned
trinomial 41TG663, was encountered. The site is a burned rock midden and sparse lithic scatter, about 25 meters
long and 15 meters wide located on a rocky bench about 75 meters northeast of an ephemeral drainage that feeds
Burks Creek, which is about 400 m to the northwest. The site is immediately west of previously recorded lithic
scatter 41TG278, described as an extensive lithic scatter when recorded as part of the All-American Pipeline
project (Figure 215 and Figure 216).
Site 41TG663 is along a section of line that was rerouted during the design phase. The original alignment was
along the edge of the ephemeral drainage and considered a high-probability area that was surveyed, including an
informal revisit of 41TG278. When the alignment shifted away from the drainage the high-probability area was
adjusted accordingly, and the site location was not included within the formal survey, which extended from Burks
Creek to the eastern edge of 41TG660, where cultural material was no longer present. An additional potential
alignment that was also not used resulted in the recording of a nearby minor lithic scatter, 41TG657.
Site 41TG663 has a transmission structure (STR 136) located immediately to the northwest (Figure 217).
Structure placement does not appear to have impacted the site. Clearing of the ROW, however, appears to have
scraped the surface of the midden and to have pushed some of the midden matrix southeast into low piles along
with surrounding trees. The central portion of the midden appears to be largely intact with densely packed firecracked limestone to a probable depth (thickness) of 50 cm (Figure 218). No other structuring (features) was
noted. While the main portion of the midden contains dark, organic-rich soil, no charcoal or other organic
417

material (bone, mussel shell) was observed. Lithic artifacts were primarily large cores and ealry-stage bifaces and
a few large flakes. There was no evidence of surrounding features or activity areas. In all, the site has about 20 to
30 percent damage from construction.
Site 41TG663 is considered to have moderate research potential. It is especially useful for its locational
information. Excavation would be useful if included as part of a regional study but less so if just an isolated
project. The site is considered to be potentially eligible for State Archeological Landmark status. Its location will
be added to areas already noted for avoidance (and described as environmentally sensitive areas) within
permanent records housed at LCRA. No other measures are recommended at this time.
Site 41TG630 is an open camp located on the north bank of Spring Creek. Shovel tests indicated cultural
materials to a depth of 1 meter with at least some bone preservation. Mussel shell and burned rock was common,
and there was some possible groundstone as well. A Late Archaic point, probably Frio, was found outside the
ROW. Avoidance measures consisted of limiting heavy machinery to surface shredding equipment. In actuality
no equipment crossed the site and all clearing was done by hand. The site is considered to be successfully
avoided (Figure 219 and Figure 220).
Site 41TG642 is a large burned rock midden with mussel shell and tools, including a Nolan point and two
Bulverde points, located on the south bank of Dove Creek. Shovel. Tests indicted probable intact deposits at
depths of up to 60 cm. Because the landowner stated the site had been previously "pushed," avoidance was
limited to hand cutting of trees and using surface shredding equipment. There is no evidence that equipment
crossed the site, and trees were clearly cut by hand. The site is considered to be successfully avoided (Figure 221
and Figure 222).
Site 41TG660 contains at least three oven and/or hearth features that shovel tests indicate have comingled to
create an incipient burned rock midden. It is located on Burks Creek about 580 meters northwest of 41TG663.
Although the site lacked obvious stone tools and no mussel shell or other organic material was noted, it is
considered to be able to potentially inform on burned rock midden formation processes and therefore was
recommended for avoidance. Avoidance measures consisted of restricting vehicular traffic around the feature
boundaries. Due to the nearby creek not being crossable at that portion of the ROW, the access road was routed
off the ROW and around the site. Barriers in the form of stakes and flagging were placed across the ROW to
discourage inadvertent traffic. This followed an incident in which equipment operators were not directly
supervised by field construction coordinators. A single pass with a bulldozer was made across the site, however
the features were not disturbed and given past ranching activities it was concluded no other damage was done.
Site 41TG660 is considered to be fully avoided (Figure 223 and Figure 224).
In summary, of three sites recommended for impact minimization within the final alignment of the Twin Buttesto-Big Hill transmission line, all were successfully avoided. The previously unknown site, 41TG663, was located
in a low-probability area and did not contain materials that construction personnel would necessarily recognize.
The site is 70-80 percent intact, including the central portion of the burned rock midden. LCRA therefore
recommends, and requests concurrence, that sites 41TG630, 642, 660 and 663 be considered fully documented in
terms of this project, and that no additional investigations are needed at this time.

Results of Monitoring

During calendar year 2012, one project was monitored, involving the placement of a transmission line
structure near a cemetery in Colorado County. Post construction monitoring was also done to confirm
avoidance of the remains of a steam-powered mill at 41CD149.

Project 18.12 Results of Monitoring: T-548, Eagle Lake-to-El Campo Transmission Line
Rebuild Project, Colorado County

In July 2011, LCRA Cultural Resource Services completed a report on an LCRA TSC transmission line
to be rebuilt between El Campo, in Wharton County, and Eagle Lake, in Colorado County (Malof and
Prikryl 2011). Six archaeological sites were documented, all north of Garwood, which is located on the
Colorado River about midway between the two endpoints. Only one of the sites, 41CD149, a turn-of-thecentury gristmill, was recommended for any kind of avoidance. Additionally, the line crosses the
Lakeside Cemetery in the community of Lakeside just south of Eagle Lake (Figure 225). One existing
structure was located within the cemetery grounds, and a second was located approximately 15 ft south of
the cemetery fence. All of the existing structures within or near the cemetery were left in place in order to
continue to support existing electrical distribution lines. A new transmission line support structure was
designed to be placed immediately south of the cemetery fence. It was subsequently redesigned and
placed approximately 50 feet south of the fence.
On August 29, 2011, the Texas Historical Commission concurred with recommendations by LCRA
Cultural Resource Service staff that construction could proceed on all portions of the project, with the
understanding that sensitive features at 41CD149 would be avoided and that construction of the structure
located at the cemetery fence would be monitored. The features at 41CD149 were staked off with metal
t-posts, and site visits were made with to LCRA field construction coordinators to ensure they were aware
of the site and the way it could be approached with equipment. Periodic visits were made by LCRA
archaeologists to ensure continued avoidance throughout the span of the project.

Lakeside Cemetery

Monitoring of the construction at the cemetery was conducted on May 2, 2012, by LCRA Cultural
Resource Services staff. The structure location had been moved south from the cemetery fence 50 ft, into
a portion of a private subdivision (Figure 226). As previous THC guidance had indicated that any ground
disturbance within 75 ft of a cemetery boundary should be assessed, construction was monitored at this
location.
The monitoring commenced with a hand-dug shovel test excavated on May 1 (Figure 227). From 0-18
cm there was a mottled sandy fill. From 18-32 cm was a layer of coal. This same layer was seen in a
cutbank of a creek immediately to the south and it is surmised that it results from some aspect of the sugar
and rice industries in the vicinity, perhaps to fire rice dryers. From 32-39 cm was a coarse sandy fill.
From 39-67 cm was grayish-brown pebbly sandy, and from 67-100 cm was consistent brown sand with
numerous pebbles and cobles. The test also encountered two telephone cables at 40 cm and a third at 60
cm.
Due to the presence of the telephone cables the structure location was relocated about 2 feet further south.
On the morning of May 2 they hand excavated a hole about 90 cm in diameter and 110 cm deep (Figure
426

228). The soil that came from this hole was carefully hand sorted as it was removed, once the disturbed
upper deposits were removed, the profile being very similar to the shovel test that had previously been
excavated. Once it was determined that there were no additional utilities within the structure location, the
truck-mounted auger assembly began excavating using an auger approximately 80 cm in diameter. The
auger removed soil in approximately 40 cm increments. About one-third of each auger âpullâ was
shoveled into a standard and examined for any artifacts or evidence of burials (Figure 229). The soil
remained consistent brown, pebbly sand, although at about 120 cm increasing clay content was noted. At
180 cm reddish sandy clay was found. Monitoring ceased at this point, although it is known the water
table was struck at 240 cm. Drilling then halted in order to allow a funeral to peacefully proceed.

As a result of the monitoring adjacent to the Lakeside Cemetery it is clear that there are no unmarked
graves the new structure location (Figure 230). The abundance of coal remains a curiosity, but indicates
widespread use at some earlier time, and it either was stored at or near the cemetery, or was spread out as
fill or base material at a later time.

41CD149
A final visit to 41CD149 was made on May 18, 2012 (Figure 231). It was determined that construction
personnel had successfully avoided impacting the sensitive portion of the site. The new structure had
been placed at the agreed-upon location and access had been from the south (Figure 232). The t-posts
that had marked the avoidance area were removed. Surface inspection did not result in discovery of any
previously undocumented features or disturbance.
