On June 17, 2009, Blanton & Associates, Inc., conducted a cultural resources survey at the request of
Dannenbaum Engineering, Inc., and on behalf of the City of McAllen, prior to the proposed expansion of
the existing 60-acre North McAllen Wastewater Treatment Plant in Hidalgo County, Texas.
Investigations consisted of an intensive archeological survey with shovel testing of the proposed 20-acre
undeveloped expansion area within the boundaries of the existing facility prior to proposed facilities
expansion, as well as a historic standing structure survey of the Area of Potential Effect (APE) for historic
studies that included the existing 60-acre facility and the adjacent areas encompassed by Hoehn Drive,
Sprague Road, North 23rd Street, and US 107. Survey efforts discovered no archeological resources in the
20-acre study area nor were any historic standing structures discovered within the historic studies APE.
No artifacts were collected and there was no curation. Based on these data, the proposed expansion
project should be allowed to proceed as planned as the proposed construction would not affect any
historic properties eligible for the National Register of Historic Places or for formal State Archeological
Landmark designation.

CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY FOR A PROPOSED EXPANSION OF THE NORTH MCALLEN WWTP

I NT R ODUC T I ON
On June 17, 2009 Blanton & Associates, Inc. conducted a cultural resources survey of 20 undeveloped
acres within the existing boundaries of the North McAllen Wastewater Treatment Plant (NMWWTP) in
the City of McAllen, Hidalgo County, Texas prior to proposed facilities expansion (Figures 1 and 2). The
City of McAllen (City) proposes to expand the existing NMWWTP located in the northwest quadrant of
the Sprauge Street/Hoehn Drive intersection in north McAllen. The current plant site encompasses
approximately 60 acres, including about 40 acres of existing facilities and infrastructure. The proposed
construction would add additional wastewater treatment capacity (Figure 3). In addition to the added
treatment capacity, the existing outfall structure in the northeast corner of the property that currently
discharges into a north-flowing drainage ditch paralleling the west side of Hoehn Drive would be replaced
with a new outfall structure relocated about 500 feet south of its current location. The project would be
financed by the City and with federal funds through the Texas Water Development Board’s (TWDB)
Clean Water State Revolving Fund (Tier III).
As the proposed construction would occur on property owned by the City, the project is subject to the
provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT), now subsumed in Title 13, Part II of the Texas
Administrative Code (TAC). This legislation requires that any political subdivision of the State of Texas
must identify potential State Archeological Landmarks (SALs) (13 TAC 26.8) through survey of public
lands prior to actions that could potentially damage those SALs. Because the construction would be
funded in part through the TWDB, the project is subject to the provisions of the Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) between the TWDB and the Texas Historical Commission (THC) that requires the
identification of SALs for projects funded by the TWDB. Additionally, as the construction would utilize
federal funds, the project is also subject to Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. All
cultural resources discovered during the survey will be assessed for their eligibility for formal SAL
designation and inclusion to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
The survey was designed to comply with appropriate archeological survey methods as defined in the
Department of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983), the Guidelines of the Council of
Texas Archeologists (1987), and the survey standards developed by the THC in conjunction with the
Council of Texas Archeologists (THC n.d.). The primary intent of the survey was to identify and describe
all archeological resources and historic standing structures discovered within the APE, evaluate their
potential eligibility for inclusion to the NRHP and for formal SAL designation, and should eligible
cultural resources be located, make recommendations for future management options such as avoidance,
preservation, or further investigations.

The project area is located in the lower Rio Grande Valley in Hidalgo County. This area lies within
Fenneman’s (1938) West Gulf Coastal Plain section of the Coastal Plain physiographic province.
Topographically, the valley exhibits generally flat alluvial and/or coastal relief. Land use adjacent to the
project area is residential, agricultural, or undeveloped.
G E OL OG Y
The proposed study area geology is the early Pleistocene Lissie Formation, undivided. This formation is
dominantly clay, silt, sand, gravel, and caliche. In localized areas, the formation is cemented with sandy
caliche. Ground surface characteristics of the formation include undrained depressions, stabilized
northwest-trending dunes, and relict clay dunes (Barnes 1976). There is no recent Holocene alluvium in
the study area, which has been consistently shown to have a good potential for containing buried
archeological material. Given its age, the Lissie Formation has little to no potential for containing
archeological resources, though overlying soils could contain prehistoric and historic resources.
SOI L S
The project area encompasses three soils: Brennan fine sandy loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes; Hidalgo sandy
clay loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes; and Hidalgo sandy clay loam, saline, 0 to 1 percent slopes. Brennan
series soils are loamy upland soils that developed in place from loamy alkaline sediments subject to eolian
processes. A typical profile of Brennan fine sandy loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes, exhibits two fine sandy
loam A horizons from approximately 0 to 30 centimeters below ground surface overlying two sandy clay
loam B horizons from roughly 30 to 120 centimeters below ground surface. Below the B horizons from
approximately 119 to 160 centimeters is a sandy clay loam C horizon (Jacobs 1981). The two A horizons
have a good potential for containing archeological resources, while the B and C horizons have a low to
moderate potential given their clayey texture and in situ development.
Hidalgo series soils are loamy upland soils that developed in situ from loamy and clayey sediments. A
representative profile (saline and non-saline) exhibits two sandy clay loam A horizons from 0 to 43
centimeters below ground surface overlying two sandy clay loam B horizons from about 43 to
97 centimeters below ground surface. The underlying clay loam C horizon extends from roughly 97 to
200 centimeters below ground surface (Jacobs 1981). There is some minor potential for these soils to
contain archeological resources. However, previous land use presumably included agricultural activities
(e.g., vegetation clearing and plowing for row crops) prior to the construction of the NMWWTP that
would have destroyed any cultural resources site within the construction footprint of the existing
facilities.
F L OR A
The project area lies within the Tamaulipan biotic province as described by Blair (1950). Within this
province, Jahrsdoerfor and Leslie (1988) recognize several biotic communities. Plant communities tend to
follow old flooding patterns and are influenced by weather conditions that become more xeric from east
to west (Vora 1992). Alluvial soils support dense riparian forests whereas drier uplands tend to be

dominated by spiny shrubs and stunted trees (Blair 1950). More than 95 percent of the original native
brush has been lost to agriculture, development, and urbanization leaving less than five percent of native
plant communities remaining in the lower Rio Grande valley (Vora 1992). The study area consists of
mowed and maintained grass with scattered mesquite trees.

A review of records and data available on the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) was
conducted. The review indicated that there are no previously recorded archeological sites within or
immediately adjacent to the study area. However, previously recorded site 41HG131 is approximately
600 meters west of the southwest corner of the NMWWTP property and just south of Sprague Street. This
site is an Isolated Find that consisted of one prehistoric artifact (not identified) found on the ground
surface during a survey of an easement for the Hidalgo-Willacy Drainage Ditch Project for Hidalgo
County Drainage District No.1. No additional investigations were recommended (TASA 2009).
The existing NWWTP property has been surveyed during three separate projects. The project area is
encompassed by the boundaries of a 1980 cultural resources survey of parts of Hidalgo and Willacy
Counties. Those investigations discovered no archeological resources in the currently proposed study area
(Day et al. 1981). TASA indicates that in 1981, the NWWTP itself was surveyed on behalf of the
Environmental Protection Agency by the Texas Department of Water Resources (TDWR); no
archeological resources were discovered (Fox 1981). In 1986, TDWR returned to the NWWTP to survey
an additional 10-meter by 20-meter area near the northwest corner of the property and, as with the 1981
investigations, no archeological resources were discovered (Fox 1986).

B&A conducted an intensive 100-percent cultural resources survey with surface and subsurface
investigations, as well as a historic resources survey within and around the proposed 20-acre expansion
area. Investigations adhered to THC survey standards (n.d.), as well as the guidelines of the Council of
Texas Archeologists (1987), and the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983).
A R C H E OL OG I C A L SUR V E Y
Surface investigations consisted of a 100 percent pedestrian survey of the proposed 20-acre expansion
area examining the ground surface for archeological remains. Transect intervals ranged from 10 to 15
meters wide. Subsurface investigations involved the systematic excavation of shovel tests across the
proposed expansion area to test for buried archeological material. Shovel tests were 30 centimeters in
diameter or on a side and excavated with a standard round point or square head shovel in arbitrary 20centimeter levels to a maximum depth of 100 centimeters below ground surface unless soil characteristics
or bedrock prohibited further hand excavation. All removed soil was screened through 0.25 inch wire
mesh to ensure artifact recovery. All appropriate data was recorded on a B&A shovel test form and all
shovel test locations were plotted with a hand-held global positioning system (GPS) receiver.
H I ST OR I C R E SOUR C E S SUR V E Y
This reconnaissance-level report was performed in accordance the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards
and Guidelines for Archeology and Historic Preservation (48 FR 44716-42) (NPS 1983). It also takes
into consideration the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (P.L. 96-515); the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (P.L. 90-190); the Archeological and Historical Preservation
Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-291); and Executive Order No. 11593 (“Protection and Enhancement of the Cultural
Environment”). Prior to fieldwork, B&A. architectural historian, Céline Finney, examined available maps
and other data pertinent to the project area. This task commenced with an investigation of the THC Atlas
Online, and the National Register Information System (NRIS) website. The Atlas and NRIS revealed that
no resources in the APE have been previously identified. No SALs or HABS/HAER resources were
identified in the study area.
The archival research continued at the Perry-Castañeda Library and the Texas State Library where the
1961 General Highway Map of Hidalgo County was researched and it was revealed that at that time the
area surrounding the proposed project area was undeveloped. Documents identified during the archival
research are listed in the bibliography and summarized in the Historic Context.
Following the preliminary archival research, a field survey was conducted of the study area in which all
resources 50-years of age or older (pre-1959) were documented. This took approximately one day to
complete. Limitations included heavy equipment on site of the proposed project area, and dense,
vegetative overgrowth. Although houses were found within the APE that appeared to be at least 45-years
of age or older, Hispanic building traditions in the Lower Rio Grande Valley continue to use older
building patterns and/or reuse/recycle materials from older or demolished houses. As a result, houses that

appear to be 45-years of age or older are often only 15 to 20 years of age. This is particularly prevalent in
rural areas of the Lower Rio Grande River Valley.
Generally, for a resource to be deemed eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, it must be at least 50-years old
and must possess historic significance and integrity. These characteristics of significance and integrity are
measured using the four NRHP Criteria:
A. That are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our
history; or
B. That are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
C. That embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction or that
represents the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant and
distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
D. That have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history
Occasionally, certain resources fall into categories in which they must be evaluated further using one or
more of the following Criterion Considerations. If a resource identified during the Reconnaissance level
survey falls into one of these categories, the following Criterion Considerations will be applied in
conjunction with one or more of the four National Register Criteria:
a. A religious property deriving primary significance from architectural or artistic distinction or historical
importance; or
b. A building or structure removed from its original location but which is significant primarily for
architectural value, or which is the surviving structure most importantly associated with a historic
person or event; or
c. A birthplace or grave of a historical figure of outstanding importance if there is no other appropriate
site or building directly associated with his or her productive life; or
d. A cemetery which derives its primary significance from graves of persons of transcendent importance,
from age, from distinctive design features, or from association with historic events; or
e. A reconstructed building when accurately executed in a suitable environment and presented in a
dignified manner as part of a restoration master plan, and when no other building or structure with the
same association has survived; or
f. A property primarily commemorative in intent if design, age, tradition, or symbolic value has invested
it with its own historical significance; or
g. A property achieving significance within the past 50 years if it is of exceptional importance.

If a significant concentration, linkage, or continuity of sites, buildings, structures, or objects united
historically or aesthetically by plan or physical development is identified, then the overall grouping is
considered a District. Historic districts can be urban or rural and can be part of a Cultural Landscape.
These are defined as a collection of features which are related to special organization and settlement
patterns. Generally, historic cultural landscapes fall into one of four categories:
A. Ethnographic Landscape- A landscape containing a variety of natural and cultural resources that
associated people define as heritage resources; or
B. Historic Designed Landscape- A landscape that was consciously designed or laid out by a landscape
architect, master gardener, architect, engineer, or horticulturist according to design principles, or an
amateur gardener working in a recognized style or tradition; or
C. Historic Vernacular Landscape- A landscape that evolved through use by the people whose
activities or occupancy shaped it. Through social or cultural attitudes of an individual, a family, or a
community, the landscape reflects the physical, biological, and cultural character of everyday lives; or
D. Historic Site- A landscape significant for its association with a historic event, activity or person.
A cultural landscape must have character-defining features that retain enough integrity to convey its
significance. These character-defining features are:
•
•
•
•
•

Topography
Vegetation
Circulation Patterns
Water Features
Cultural Modifications

In order for a historic resource, district, or landscape to be determined eligible for the National Register, it
must retain enough of its historic integrity to convey its significance. For the NRHP there are seven
aspects of integrity:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Location
Design
Setting
Materials
Workmanship
Feeling
Association

All of the above criteria and guidelines were used in tandem or individually when evaluating individual
resources or groups of resources to determine their eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP.

Cultural resources survey efforts for the proposed expansion of the NMWWTP discovered no prehistoric
artifacts (e.g., burned clay or debitage) or historic artifacts or structures within the proposed undeveloped
20-acre expansion area (Figure 4). Similarly, no standing structures were discovered within the APE for
historic studies (see Figure 4). The existing 60-acre NMWWTP facility has been extensively disturbed by
previous vegetation clearing, as well as the original construction (and subsequent maintenance
construction) and installation of existing facility infrastructure (e.g., subsurface water and wastewater
pipelines, buried and overhead electrical lines, settling pond, paved roadways, and drainage ditches)
(Figure 5).
Due to land grading activities during the original plant construction, the ground surface within the 60-acre
facility was extensively disturbed with the removal of an unknown amount of sediment. Soil removed
during site grading presumably was used to construct the berm around the existing settling pond.
Additionally, the construction of the existing facility involved the excavation of three one-meter deep
ditches along the interior perimeter of the north, south, and west facility fence line (Figure 6) that
provided excellent deep subsurface exposure. The existing outfall structure drains into an earthen
drainage ditch just outside the facility’s eastern boundary fence. Ten meters east of the earthen ditch is a
cement-lined canal (Figure 7; see Figure 4). The cement-lined canal is 20 meters east of the drainage ditch
and 30 meters east of the eastern boundary fence of NMWWTP. A proposed outfall structure would also
drain into the existing drainage ditch.
A R C H E OL OG I C A L SUR V E Y
Ground surface visibility, despite some tall grasses, throughout the planned 20-acre construction area
ground surface visibility averaged about 25 to 35 percent, though in areas such as the southern one-third
of the proposed expansion area surface visibility was 100 percent (Figure 8). Surface investigations
within the existing NMWWTP and proposed acre expansion area discovered no trace of archeological
resources (e.g., chipped-stone debitage and burned clay).
Subsurface investigations involved the excavation of eight shovel tests across the majority of the 20-acre
planned expansion area (STs 1 through 8) and ST 9 near the proposed outfall location (see Figure 4). As
mentioned, no shovel tests were excavated in the southern one-third of the 20-acre expansion area where
surface visibility was 100 percent. As Table 1 indicates, the maximum depth of excavation was 80
centimeters below ground surface. All shovel tests exhibited mixed soils between 0 and 25 centimeters
below ground surface resulting from previous construction and daily use of heavy machinery in the
facility. STs 1 through 8 tested the majority of the 20-acre expansion area except for the southern part
where there was 100 percent visibility (see Figure 8). Shovel testing revealed dense heavy loamy and
clayey deltaic soils that became increasingly sticky and moist with depth, which prohibited excavations
deeper than 80 centimeters below ground surface. Based on these results, no archeological resources
would be impacted by the proposed expansion of the NMWWTP.

Historic Context
Although present day Hidalgo County was settled in the 18th century by European immigrants, it was not
until the arrival of the railroad in 1904 that the region became settled by Midwestern farmers. These
farmers, with the establishment of irrigation districts and canals were able to grow crops nearly year
round, and produce a variety of crops that were then shipped to northern states. With the Mexican
Revolution, Anglo settlement virtually stopped, however, by the 1920s, people were once again flocking
to the Lower Rio Grande Valley. During this period, the county population had doubled to slightly over
38,000, and the number of farms had increased seven-fold to approximately 1,700. Unlike earlier settlers
to the area, Midwestern farmers were not so willing to accept Hispanic culture and segregation was
instilled, which resulted in difficult times for long-time families living in the region.
By 1930, the number of farms more than doubled and truck farming was well established. Citrus, which
had always been grown in Hidalgo County, became the most profitable crop during the 1950s. During the
1970s, the Civil Rights movement played a significant role in Hispanic rights. Colonias, established by
Mexican immigrants developed throughout rural areas of the county, often incorporating house types of
previous decades. By the late 20th century, Hidalgo County’s primary sources of income derived from
agriculture and tourism. The population continued to grow, reaching nearly 400,000 by the 1990s. Today,
Hidalgo County is a popular destination for Winter Texans because of the mild winters, and continues to
draw a large tourist base (Bloodworth and Gillet 2009; Garza 2009).
Survey
The results of the historic resources survey are presented in Table 2 and plotted on Figure 4. The APE for
historic studies comprises agricultural fields, new suburban development, and a non-historic-age
wastewater treatment plant (Figure 9; see Figure 6). All historic and historic-age resources 50-years of
age or older (pre-1959) are described below. Each resource has been accessed to determine if it is eligible
for inclusion in the NRHP, with the evaluation found after each description. For those resources listed or
eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, the recommended boundaries and effect of the proposed project are
cited.

When evaluating historic-age resources, integrity is an integral part of the evaluation. For those resources
that no longer retain the integrity necessary to convey their significance, they are determined not eligible
for inclusion to the NRHP. Common examples of a particular type that are prolific throughout Texas
and/or the nation and that lack significant character defining details were also determined not eligible.
For resources that fit within a certain theme of the historic context, they had to meet certain aspects of
integrity specific to their context.
Historic Resource #1- Concrete-lined Canal
This abandoned concrete-lined canal (see Figure 7) is part of the Hidalgo County Irrigation District
Number 1 in Hidalgo County, Texas. The district was established ca. 1926, most likely after the pump
house was constructed and consists of approximately 38 miles of main canals, 54 miles of secondary
canals, 109 miles of underground pipelines, and 48 miles of drain ditches that also serve the surrounding
communities. During the later part of the 20th century, due to significant water loss as a result of
evaporation, and improved irrigation technologies, most irrigation districts began burying their systems
and using pipes instead of open canals. Prior to this, however, canals were concrete-lined in an attempt to
reduce water loss through ground seepage. Historic Resource #1 is an example of a concrete-lined canal,
however, it is no longer in use and overgrown with weeds. Several sections appear to be non-historic-age
concrete as well. Since a single component of an irrigation district cannot be individually evaluated for
inclusion into the NHRP, the overall district must be examined. Because the Hidalgo County Irrigation

District Number 1 is over 50 percent altered due to the installation of underground pipeline, the overall
district is not recommended eligible for inclusion to the NRHP under Criterion A, B, or C.

Surface and subsurface archeological investigations of the proposed 20-acre expansion area discovered no
archeological resources. Archeological survey within the NMWWTP revealed substantial surface and
subsurface disturbances from previous facility and infrastructure construction, as well as buried and
overhead utilities. Given those disturbances, the results of the survey, and the geologic and soil conditions
within the archeological survey area, it is the opinion of B&A that the proposed expansion area possesses
little to no potential for containing previously unidentified archeological resources.
Only one historic-age resource (Historic Resource #1) was identified in the historic studies APE, a
historic north-south flowing concrete-lined canal 30 meters east of the NMWWTP eastern boundary
fence. The planned construction of a new outfall structure approximately 500 feet south of the existing
outfall would not impact Historic Resource #1, which is part of the Hidalgo County Irrigation District
Number 1. This district irrigation district has had more than 50 percent of its canals reconfigured to buried
pipelines and, as a result, the irrigation district is considered Not Eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under
Criterion A, B, or C. Given a lack of historic standing structures and associated landscapes within the
APE, it is B&A’s opinion that the project will not affect any historic standing structures or historic
landscape.
Based on the above data, B&A recommends that the proposed construction should be allowed to proceed
as planned without additional cultural resource investigations, as survey efforts within the historic studies
APE discovered no historic properties or sites, and previous levels of disturbance within the 20-acre
expansion area are not conducive to the preservation of intact archeological deposits so the proposed
construction would not affect any historic properties (as per 36 CFR 800.4(d)(1)) or SALs.
In the event that previously unidentified archeological materials are discovered during construction, work
in the immediate area of discovery would cease until the THC is contacted and accidental discovery
procedures initiated.
