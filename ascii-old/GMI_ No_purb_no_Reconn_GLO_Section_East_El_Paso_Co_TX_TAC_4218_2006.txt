Archeological Reconnaissance Sample Survey and Surface
Geomorphological Overview of a Permanent School Fund Section
in East El Paso, El Paso County, Texas
Project Background
The Texas General Land Office (GLO), serving as agent for the Texas Permanent School Fund
(PSF), proposes to sell a 640-acre parcel in El Paso County, Texas. The parcel in question is PSF
Tract # 104934, an undeveloped 640-acre section located at the eastern margin of El Paso in El
Paso County, Texas. The survey parcel is located just outside the current urban expansion of El
Paso, approximately three miles south of U.S. Highway 180 (Figure 1).
The purpose of the reconnaissance sample survey reported herein was intended to provide a basic
quantitative estimate of site counts and densities within three environmental and
geomorphological contexts identified in the parcel, and more importantly, provide an estimate of
the numbers of sites potentially warranting formal designation as State Archeological Landmarks
(SALs) under the Antiquities Code of Texas. This information will be valuable to GLO in
developing recommendations for management of the sites under its Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) with Texas Historical Commission (THC). Sites identified as likely to be
eligible for formal SAL designation will be protected with antiquities conservation easements
prior to the proposed residential development of the parcel.

Geomorphic and Environmental Context
The 640-acre parcel is situated in the central Hueco Bolson several miles from the Franklin and
Hueco mountains that border the bolson, and thus the parcel is situated far from any major
alluvial drainage channels and fan piedmonts that were the subject of major settlement during
much of the prehistoric sequence in far west Texas. Elevations range from 4,010 to 4,035 feet
above mean sea level (Figure 2). A subtle east-to-west slope is present across the parcel and a
slightly elevated terrace or ridgeline is present along the eastern third of the section.
A preliminary aerial inspection of the parcel identified two primary geomorphological contexts
within the subject parcel. The majority of the parcel consists of aeolian coppice dune topography
typical of much of the region. Mesquite-stabilized coppice dunes characterize the topography of
this region. Using the basic terminology for developmental stages of coppice dune formation in
the southern Mesilla Bolson west of El Paso proposed by Basabilvazo and Earl (1987:18), the
majority of dunes throughout the project area would be classified as being in an intermediate or
advanced stage of development. Advanced coppice dunes are mature, well-stabilized, and steepsided dune structures that generally measure more than two meters in height. Advanced coppice
dune microtopography is generally analogous to Mapping Unit 1 as described in Monger’s (1993)
geomorphic review of the Fort Bliss maneuver areas. Johnson (1997) and Monger (1993)
specifically link this and other microtopographic landforms to varying patterns of artifact and site
visibility or burial. Corresponding to the maturity of the dune formations of this landform,
interdunal areas are usually severely deflated and sheet sand deposits are either absent or of
minimal depth and extent. Intermediate coppice dune topography includes dunes of smaller
heights typically surrounded by sheet sand deposits. Preservation of cultural deposits is better in
this area, although some portions of sites may be buried and obscured by recent sand deposits.
Several shallow playa drainage basins, or bajos, are present at western and northeastern margins
of the parcel as indicated by greater densities of vegetation. One or two small bajos may be
present, or they may represent the remains of a larger, single bajo where portions have been
obscured by aeolian sand deposition. Playas and bajos served as important water catchment
areas, as well as focused locations of increased biomass, and accordingly were focal points of
prehistoric occupation of the arid basin floor. Higher site densities, and more intensivelyoccupied sites, may be present around the margins of these bajos, depending on their size, depth,
and frequency and duration of water ponding within their catchment areas. Terraces and ridges
near bajos were particularly favored settlement locations (Miller 2006).

Previous Research and Anticipated Cultural Resources
Large areas of the Hueco Bolson to the north and southwest of the survey parcel were the subject
of extensive surveys during the 1970s (Lynn et al. 1975; Whalen 1977, 1978). The only recent
survey in the immediate project area involved examination of an El Paso Electric powerline, a
segment of which was to follow the path of the dirt road around the southern and eastern margins
of the GLO-PSF parcel (Peterson and Willis 2001). Two sites, 41EP5542 and 41EP5543, were
recorded along this segment of the proposed powerline (Figure 2). Site 41EP5542 was
documented as containing at least eight burned rock thermal features, several of which had good
integrity and retained organic deposits. Artifact counts associated with these features were not
disclosed. Site 41EP5543 was recorded as a low-density artifact scatter that had been almost
entirely destroyed by road construction.

survey parcel (PSF 104934; Section 48) and previously recorded sites.
As indicated on the topographic map, a historic road passes through the survey parcel. Previous
surveys in the vicinity have identified this feature as “The Old Hueco Tanks Road” that provided
a transportation corridor between the town of Socorro and Hueco Tanks (see Peterson and Green
1997 and Peterson and Graves 1998).
It is anticipated that similar low-density and low-intensity sites will be the most common sites in
the proposed survey parcel. However, sites with higher artifact densities in association with
hearths, as well as residential occupations with huts, may also be present in the vicinity of the
bajos or positioned along slightly elevated terraces and ridges. A review of chronometric data
from sites in the central basins (Mauldin et al. 1998; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004) indicates that
the majority of occupations date to the Late Archaic Period (1200 B.C.-A.D. 200/900) and early
Formative Period (AD 200/900-1000). Occupations dating to the Paleoindian, Early Archaic,
Middle Archaic, Late Formative, and Protohistoric Periods are rare.

Survey Method
A reconnaissance sample archaeological survey was conducted of the 640-acre parcel. The
survey was conducted to provide a basic quantitative sample of the parcel that was then utilized to
provide rough estimates of SAL-eligible sites within the three stratified geomorphological environmental zones.

3

The survey parcel was stratified into three geomorphological/environmental zones present within
the property: grass-stabilized surfaces along the elevated terrace and ridgeline in the eastern 1/3
of the section, sloping coppice dune surfaces in the central 1/3 of the section, and the bajo-margin
depressions and low-lying landforms along the western 1/3.
Systemically positioned survey transects were walked across these areas to identify major
prehistoric or historic archeological sites present. Transects were oriented north-south, were 10
meters in width, and were systematically placed at 100 m intervals across the parcel in order to
provide quantitative data on the numbers and distributions of sites within the three sample zones.
Placement of the survey transects and maintenance of transect lines were accomplished with the
use of a global-positioning system (GPS) unit with sub-meter accuracy. The 100 m interval
transects provided 10% sample coverage of the parcel. The survey was conducted over the
course of two days by two professional archeologists.
Major, SAL-eligible sites were documented during the course of the survey. These major, SALeligible sites were defined as those containing two or more features with good integrity in
unambiguous association with statistically robust artifact assemblages, or features or artifact
assemblages representing rare temporal components. Small, single hearth localities and isolated,
low-density artifact scatters were noted, described, and tabulated, but were not formally recorded.
The locations of all sites and isolated finds were recorded using the GPS unit.
No artifacts or cultural materials were collected during the survey. Important chronologically and
technologically diagnostic artifacts were described and plotted using the GPS and some items
were digitally photographed (Figure 3).

An overview of the surface geomorphological context of the parcel was conducted by the
Principal Investigator and the Field Supervisor who completed a formal training course in aeolian
geomorphology conducted by Dr. David Kuehn, former staff geomorphologist for Geo-Marine,
Inc. Particular attention was given to defining geomorphic-topographic zones. Surface inspection
of each zone was conducted to obtain a first-order impression of the integrity and extent of
Holocene-aged (Q3 or Organ deposits) deposits. Road cuts and other exposures were examined
to determine the depth of Q3 deposits in selected areas. Densities of cultural materials recorded
in transects were compared to determine whether potential erosional differences in the two
geomorphological survey zones have affected the visibility of cultural materials, and thus helped
assess whether significant buried cultural deposits and intensively occupied sites may be present
in the northern half of the parcel.

Results of the Sample Reconnaissance Survey
The survey of 640 acres at 100 m intervals resulted in the documentation of four multiple feature
sites, including three new sites and one previously recorded site (41EP5542), and 63 isolated
finds. A second previously recorded site (41EP5543) was located along the road delineating the
eastern boundary of the current PSF survey parcel survey, and had been destroyed by
construction of the road (Peterson and Willis 2001). The isolated finds included 20 isolated
hearths or thermal features with one locale containing two thermal features, a cluster of historic
glass jar fragments, one ceramic “pot drop”, and several diffuse, low-density artifact scatters
consisting of ceramics, lithics, and/or cookstones (burned caliche or fire-cracked rock).
Overview of Surface Geomorphology and Topography
The surface geomorphological review identified three major topographic and geomorphic zones
within the survey parcel: a north-south trending fault line depression in the western part of the
survey parcel, a slightly sloping area across the center of the parcel, and a slightly elevated ridge
or terrace at the eastern margin of the parcel. Each of these zones accounts for approximately 1/3
of the survey parcel. In addition, the far eastern edge of the parcel slopes towards another faultline depression and group of bajos to the east (Figure 4).
The southern area of the western depression zone contains two shallow bajos. Surrounding areas
have scattered, shallow dune formations and generally level interdune surfaces of historic aeolian
Q4 sand deposits (Figure 5). The Q4 deposits contain moderate to high densities of carbonate
(caliche) nodules, indicating that the Q1 indurated caliche horizon is near the present ground
surface and is buried by generally shallow Holocene Q3 and Q4 sediments. Trowel testing in
several interdunal areas revealed Pleistocene Q2 and caliche Q1 soils at depths of only 5 to 20 cm
below the surface. Recent dating has established that the Q2 stratigraphic unit predates human
occupation in the area (Hall 2006). The northern areas of the zone have slightly thicker Holocene
deposits with more grasses and less carbonate nodules, indicating the present of slightly more
stable surfaces in areas distant from the bajos that are subject to greater degrees of wind erosion.
Based on the shallow nature of Holocene aeolian deposits in this zone, it is assumed that site
burial was uncommon and that few features or sites were buried and remained undetected within
the sample survey transects.

Figure 5. Terrain and surface deposits in the western depression area. Line of
vegetation in the right background denotes one of the bajos in the southwestern part of
the survey parcel. Note the shallow historic aeolian deposits and minimal dune
formations characteristic of this geomorphic-topographic zone.

The central 1/3 of the project area consists of slightly sloping terrain (<1 to 3 degrees) leading
towards the terrace or ridge to the east. This area is characterized by moderate to high numbers
of mesquite-stabilized coppice dunes of varying height and size. Interdunal areas vary from
aggraded sand sheets to highly eroded surfaces in relatively equal proportions. Trowel tests in
interdune areas identified recent aeolian sand deposits ranging from 10 to 30 cm in depth
overlying very shallow Holocene-aged Q3 sediments. A profile of these deposits was observed
provided in a cut bank along the “Old Hueco Tanks Road” (Figure 6).

Figure 6. Profile exposed along the “Old Hueco Tanks Road” in the central portion of
the project area. Reddish Q2 sands of Pleistocene age can be seen in the lower
portions of the road cut and road surface. Holocene Q3 and historic dune formations of
moderate depth are present above the Q2 horizon.
The slightly elevated fault-line terrace or ridge at the eastern floor ridge terrain identified in the
eastern 1/3 of the parcel had the least amount of aeolian deflation. Elevated ridgelines serve as
sediment traps for windstorms originating predominately from the east (Hall 2006), and terraces,
ridges, and other elevated landforms at the eastern margins of bajos, playas or the broad basins
tend to accumulate large sand sheets. The area is characterized by moderate numbers of 1 to 2
m-high mesquite-stabilized coppice dunes. Interdunal areas vary from having aggraded sand
sheets to highly deflated and eroded surfaces, although the former condition with grass-stabilized
sand sheets appeared to be most common (Figure 7). Carbonate nodules are rare in the interdunal
areas, suggesting the presence of preserved Holocene soil deposits. Trowel tests in these areas
revealed historic Q4 aeolian sediments range from 10 cm to more than 1 m in depth overlying
well-preserved Holocene-aged Q3 sediments. This zone likely contains buried cultural deposits
and features. In fact, the three sites recorded in this area were all exposed around the margins of
large sand sheets where deflation had removed the historic Q4 sands.
At the far eastern edge of the survey parcel the ridge slopes towards another slight depression
with several bajos. Several ephemeral and shallow drainages lead from the ridge to the
depression and bajos.

Figure 7. Photograph of grass-stabilized interdunal sand sheets on the elevated ridge in
the eastern portion of the survey parcel.
The three geomorphic-topographic zones present variable conditions for site burial/visibility and
preservation. The western depression has the greatest degree of aeolian erosion and least
substantial Holocene soil deposits. It is unlikely that significant sites or cultural deposits are
buried in this area, and it is also likely that hearths, pits, and cultural features in this zone will
have the poorest degree of preservation and integrity. Site visibility and preservation in the
central slope zone will vary according to microtopographic soil conditions. Sites situated on the
eastern terrace are expected to be preserved under aggraded sand sheets and will have the highest
degree of preservation and integrity. It is also likely that a small number of small sites and
individual features remained undetected during surface survey in this zone. However, large sites
would have been identified through some form of surface manifestation.

Site Descriptions
The sample reconnaissance survey resulted in the documentation of four multiple feature sites,
including three new sites and one previously recorded site (Figure 8).

41EP5807 (GLO Recon Site 1)
Site 41EP5807 is a large prehistoric campsite situated in the center of the survey parcel.
Elevation of the site is 4,025 feet amsl. The site datum is located at UTM coordinates 385566E
3516229N (Zone 13, NAD 83) and may be found 650 m north of a private paved road that
extends from Montwood Drive in east El Paso County, Texas.
The site extends for a distance of approximately 76 m east/west (385540 to 385605E) and 140 m
north/south (3516187 to 3516332N) for a total area of 6,055 m2. The site is situated on a slight
western slope (< one degree) between the depression to the west and ridge to the east. The site
surface is predominately covered with dune sands that are estimated to cover more than 70% of
the surface. Soils in the area have been classified as within the Hueco Series, Hueco-Wink
Association, hummocky (Jaco 1971). Flora includes mesquite covering 1 to 2 m-high coppice
dunes, four-wing saltbush, and broom snakeweed. Flora covers roughly 10 to 20 percent of the
site surface. Surface sediments include aeolian light brown sands (Q4 - modern) from roughly
0.10 to 2.0 m deep with low to high densities of caliche nodule inclusions with some exposed
compact brown sandy loam (Q3) in some deflated inter dune areas. The site is in fair to good
condition with minimal deflation. Some aeolian erosion of topsoil has occurred in a few areas
between dunes affecting less than 20 % of the site surfaces. Some bioturbation by rodents was
noted by the presence of caliche nodules in these deflated areas.
Eleven thermal features were identified on the site surface (Figure 9). These features are situated
in the southern and central portions of the site. Feature 1 is in the far southeast corner and
consists of a 1.2 m diameter concentration of > 50 partially exposed pieces of burned caliche with
no charcoal stained sediments. Feature 2 is in the southeast portion of the site 20 m east of
Feature 1. Feature 2 consists of > 75 partially exposed pieces of burned caliche over a 1.5 m
diameter area eroding out of dune sands to the south with no noted charcoal stained sediments.
Feature 3 is in the southeast portion of the site 5.0 m northwest of Feature 2. Feature 3 consists of
> 30 pieces of partially exposed burned caliche over a 0.75 m diameter area eroding out of dune
sands to the south. Feature 4 is located just to the north of Feature 3. Feature 4 is a concentration
of > 300 pieces of burned caliche over a 3.0 m north/south by 5.0 m east/west area with no
charcoal stained sediments and two lithic flakes. Feature 5 is 20 m to the west/northwest of
Feature 3 and Feature 4. Feature 5 is a 1.4 m east/west by 1.0 m north/south partially exposed
scattered concentration of > 50 burned caliche with no charcoal stained sediments. Feature 6 is
10 to 15 m northwest of Feature 5 in the southwest portion of the site. Feature 6 is a 1.3 m
diameter 0.2 m high concentration of > 75 burned caliche and one limestone single sided mano
fragment within charcoal stained sediments. Feature 7 is in the south central, to central portion of
the site. Feature 7 is a dispersed scatter of > 50 pieces of burned caliche and > 20 limestone lithic
flakes and one chalcedony flake over a 4.0 m east/west by 3.0 m north/south area with no
charcoal stained sediments. Feature 8 is roughly 13 m northeast of Feature 7. Feature 8 consists
of a concentration of > 20 partially exposed burned caliche > 0.10 m deep over a 1.1 m diameter
area. Feature 9 and 10 are roughly 10 to 15 m to the north of Feature 7 and Feature 8 in the
central portion of the site. Feature 9 is a 1.5 m east/west by 1.0 m north/south dispersed
concentration of > 20 large, cobble sized burned caliche with no charcoal stained sediments.
Feature 10 is a dispersed concentration of > 100 small pieces of burned caliche over a 3.0 m
diameter area with no charcoal stained sediments. Feature 11 is in the central portion of the site
roughly 20 m north of Feature 10. Feature 11 is a partially exposed concentration of > 15 burned
caliche with charcoal stained sediments > 0.10 m deep. Given the presence of scattered
fragments of burned caliche throughout the site, it is possible that additional thermal features may
be present and hidden under deposits of aeolian sand.

Cultural materials are relatively low in number and are scattered throughout the site. The
majority of surface materials consist of pieces of burned caliche; more than 150 pieces were
observed scattered across the site. Additional cultural materials include > 50 lithic artifacts,
seven El Paso Brownware ceramics, and one historic .22 caliber long shell within clip. The latter
is an isolate in the north central portion of the site. The lithic artifacts include the base of an
expanded stem chert dart point typed as a San Jose style point (Justice 2002:132), 14 lithic flakes,
three utilized lithic flakes, one marginally retouched lithic tool, two unifacially shaped tools, four
lithic cores, a hammerstone fragment, one complete two-sided sandstone wedge shaped mano, a
mica-schist pestle fragment, and 16 sandstone metate fragments. Raw materials include a variety
of cherts, obsidian, limestone, Franklin Mountain rhyolite, and quartzite. Two of the marginally
retouched lithic tools are manufactured of ignimbrite (flow-banded rhyolite) from the Franklin
Mountains.
The single projectile point base was recorded just to the east of Features 3 and 4, indicating the
potential presence of a rare Middle to Late Archaic Period component. The seven El Paso
Brownware ceramics were recorded in the far north portion of the site within a 2 m diameter area.
Most of the metate fragments (> 15) were located in the south central portion of the site within a
3 m diameter area. These pieces may represent the deflated remains of an additional thermal
feature, since groundstone fragments were frequently recycled as hearth stones.
The presence of multiple thermal features and discrete spatial clustering of occupational
components indicates the site has horizontal integrity. The presence of a San Jose style projectile
point base and El Paso Brownware ceramics indicates that a Middle to Late Archaic Period
component and a Ceramic period component is present. The site contains intact and partially
exposed burned caliche features and associated artifacts in an area with minimal deflation.
Site 41EP5808 (GLO Recon Site 2)
Site 41EP5808 is an intermediate-sized prehistoric campsite situated on the fault-line terrace in
the southeaster quadrant of the project area. Elevation of the site is 4,030 feet amsl. The site
datum is located at UTM coordinates 385989E 3515977N (Zone 13, NAD 83). This location is
500 m north of a private paved road that extends off the east end of the present day Montwood
Drive in eastern El Paso County, Texas.
The site extends for a distance of approximately 45 m north/south (3515960 to 3515995N) and 36
m east/west (385980 to 386013E) for a total area of 1,159 m2. The site is situated on the broad,
slightly elevated terrace landform of the eastern part of the survey parcel. The site is covered
with sheets sand and dune deposits estimated to cover > 80 percent of the surface. Soils in the
area have been classified as within the Hueco Series, Hueco-Wink Association, hummocky (Jaco
1971). Flora of the site includes mesquite associated with 1 to 2 m-high coppice dunes, fourwing saltbush, and broom snakeweed. Surface sediments include aeolian light brown sands
(historic Q4) from 10 cm to 2 m in depth with varying densities of carbonate nodule in interdunal
areas. The site is in fair to good condition with minimal deflation.
Six thermal features were identified on the surface (Figure 10). These features are distributed
throughout the site area. Feature 1 is at the southern edge of the site and is a 2.0 m diameter
dispersed concentration of > 50 pieces of burned caliche and one granite fire-cracked rock with
no charcoal stained sediments. Feature 2 is in the southeast portion of the site roughly 8.0 m
northeast of Feature 1. Feature 2 is a partially exposed dark charcoal stain > 0.40 m in diameter
and > 0.10 m deep. Feature 3 is in the east central portion of the site. Feature 3 is a partially
exposed hearth with five large burned caliche and charcoal stained sediments > 0.30 m in
13

diameter and > 0.10 m deep. Feature 4 is in the north central portion of the site. Feature 4 is a
1.5 m north/south by 1.0 m east/west dispersed concentration of > 30 burned caliche and one
burned bone fragment with no charcoal stained sediments. Feature 5 is in the west central portion
of the site. Feature 5 consists of > 150 burned caliche over a 2.5 m north/south by 1.2 m
east/west area eroding out of dune sands to the north with no noted charcoal stained sediments.
Feature 6 is against the north edge of the site. Feature 6 is a 2.0 m diameter scattered
concentration of > 75 burned caliche with no charcoal stained sediments.
Cultural materials observed on the surface include one concentration of lithic artifacts around
Feature 4 and a few scattered additional materials (Figure 10). Lithic artifacts were the sole
artifact class observed at the site. The artifact concentration around Feature 4 included > 20 lithic
flakes of obsidian, a variety of cherts, and some rhyolite. This concentration also contained a
chert core and a rhyolite hammerstone fragment. The concentration extended over a 4 by 3 m
area. Additional artifacts recorded on the surface of this site included some scattered pieces of
burned caliche, two sandstone indeterminate ground stone fragments, a unifacially shaped
rhyolite cobble chopper tool, two Franklin Mountain rhyolite hammerstone fragments, a
chalcedony flake, and a complete limestone anvil.
No chronologically diagnostic artifacts were observed, and the temporal placement of 41EP5808
remains indeterminate. The presence of multiple thermal features suggests multiple occupations
may be present, although the presence of a discrete lithic artifact concentration also indicates the
potential presence of a central activity area (see Miller 2006). The site contains intact and
partially exposed thermal burned caliche features and associated artifacts in an area with minimal
deflation.
Site 41EP5809 (GLO Recon Site 3)
Site 41EP5809 is an intermediate-sized prehistoric campsite situated on the fault-line terrace at
the northeastern corner of the survey parcel. Elevation of the site is 4,025 feet amsl. The site
datum is located at UTM coordinates 386207E 3516988N (Zone 13, NAD 83). This location is
1.45 km north of a private paved road that extends off the east end of the present day Montwood
Drive in eastern El Paso County, Texas.
The site extends for a distance of approximately 36 m east/west (386186 to 386238E) and 51 m
north/south (3516967 to 3517015N) for a total area of 981 m2. The site is on the eastern slope of
the elevated terrace landform comprising the eastern region of the survey parcel. The site surface
is slightly covered with sheet sand and dune deposits that are estimated to cover > 30 percent of
the area. Soils in the area have been classified as within the Hueco Series, Hueco-Wink
Association, hummocky (Jaco 1971). Flora of the site includes mesquite associated with 1 to 2
m- high coppice dunes, four-wing saltbush, soap tree yucca, and broom snakeweed. Flora covers
roughly 10 to 20 percent of the site surface. Surface sediments include aeolian light brown sands
(historic Q4) from 0.10 cm to 2 m in depth with low densities of carbonate nodules exposed in
interdunal areas. The northern portion of the site is bisected by a shallow ephemeral drainage
leading towards the bajo located just outside the northeastern boundary of the project area. This
arroyo or drainage contributed to the exposure of Feature 1.

14

Figure 10. Map of site 41EP5808.

15

Two thermal hearth features were identified on the surface in the northern area of the site (Figure
11). Feature 1 is a 1.5 m diameter 0.10 m high mounded concentration of > 250 pieces of burned
caliche with faint charcoal stained sediments > 0.10 m deep along with one white chert tertiary
incomplete single facet platform bearing flake. Feature 2 is roughly 12 m to the south of Feature
1. Feature 2 is a 1.5 m diameter partially exposed concentration of > 100 pieces of burned caliche
with charcoal stained sediments > 0.10 m deep. Additional thermal features may still be present
given the presence of scattered pieces of burned caliche upslope to the southwest of Features 1
and 2.
Cultural materials present on the surface include one incomplete Hueco Mountain tan chert flake
and one large two sided quartzite basin metate fragment that was only partially exposed against
the west edge of a mesquite dune in the north portion of the site, the single white chert flake
within Feature 1, three Hueco Mountain tan chert flakes between Feature 1 and Feature 2, an
obsidian flake and another Hueco tan chert flake in the south portion, and roughly five scattered
pieces of burned caliche against the south edge (Figure 11).
No chronologically diagnostic artifacts were observed, and the temporal placement of 41EP5809
remains indeterminate. The site contains intact and partially exposed thermal burned caliche
features and associated artifacts in an area with minimal deflation. The surface artifact
assemblage presents limited analytical potential.
Site 41EP5542 (GLO Recon Site 4)
Site 41EP5542 is a large prehistoric campsite situated on the fault-line terrace near the southern
boundary of the survey parcel. Elevation of the site is 4,030 feet amsl. The newly established
site datum is located at UTM coordinates 385770E 3515549N (Zone 13, NAD 83). This location
is 20 m north of a private paved road that extends from present day Montwood Drive in eastern El
Paso County, Texas.
The present definition of the site extends for a distance of 150 m east/west (385770 to 385935E)
and 70 m north/south (3515540 to 3515610N) for a total area of 5,762 m2.
The site is situated on the elevated terrace landform. The site surface is covered with sheet and
dune sands that are estimated to cover > 80 percent of the surface. Soils in the area have been
classified as within the Hueco Series, Hueco-Wink Association, hummocky (Jaco 1971). Flora
includes mesquite associated with 1 to 2 m-high coppice dunes, four-wing saltbush, soap tree
yucca, and broom snakeweed. Flora covers roughly 10 to 20 percent of the site surface. Surface
sediments include aeolian light brown sands (historic Q4) from roughly 10 cm to 2 m in depth
with low densities of carbonate nodules exposed in interdunal areas. Holocene Q3 sediments are
preserved under the dune deposits.
The site was initially recorded in February of 2001 (Peterson and Willis 2001). This initial
recording identified the site as covering an area of 14,400 m2 with eight thermal features,
hundreds of ceramics and a moderate density of lithic and ground stone artifacts (Peterson and
Willis 2001:18-19). The site was considered to be in good condition with minimal deflation and
several regions of aggraded aeolian deposits. The site was recommended as being eligible for
inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places and warranting formal designation as a State
Archeological Landmark.

The variation in site size between the two surveys is because the current survey was a
reconnaissance and did not proceed to identify additional scattered artifacts beyond a 30 m
distance threshold. Given the extensive sheet sand deposits across the area, it is likely that the
actual site area falls somewhere between the two surveys.
The recent investigations identified nine surface thermal features distributed across the site
(Figure 12). Feature 1 consists of a partially exposed concentration of 10 burned caliche
fragments, several fire-cracked rocks and a round Franklin Mountain rhyolite hammerstone with
charcoal stained sediments over a 1.0 m east/west by 0.75 m north/south area extending > 0.10 m
below the surface. Feature 2 is a charcoal stain partially exposed > 0.10 m in diameter and
extending > 0.10 m below the present surface in the west portion of the site. Feature 3 consists of
a 1.0 m diameter concentration of > 15 large cobble sized pieces of burned caliche with charcoal
stain sediments over a 1.0 m diameter area and extending > 0.10 m below the modern ground
surface. Feature 4 consists of a dispersed concentration of > 30 pieces of burned caliche eroding
out of dune sands to the south over a 3.0 m east/west by 1.0 m north/south area with no noted
charcoal stained sediments against the far west edge of the site. Feature 5 is located in the west
central portion of the site. Feature 5 consists of a partially exposed charcoal stain > 0.20 m in
diameter and extending > 0.10 m below the modern ground surface. El Paso brown ceramics are
located 3.0 m north of this feature. Feature 6 is also located in the west central portion of the site.
Feature 6 is a scatter of > 50 burned caliche and fire-cracked rocks against the south edge of a
dune with sandstone ground stone fragments and several lithic flakes over a 4.0 m east/west by
1.5 m north/south area. Feature 7 is in the east central portion of the site. Feature 7 consists of a
partially exposed concentration of > 30 pieces of burned caliche over a 1.3 m diameter area.
Feature 8 is in the far-east portion of the site. Feature 8 consists of a dispersed scatter of > 40
pieces of burned caliche, > 10 pieces of El Paso brown ceramics, > 10 lithic artifacts eroding out
of a dune over a 6.0 m east/west by 3.0 m north/south area. Feature 9 is located in the far
northeast portion of the site. Feature 9 consists of a partially exposed concentration of > 30
pieces of burned caliche and charcoal stained sediments > 0.10 m deep over a 1.0 m diameter
area. Additional scattered pieces of burned caliche and fire-cracked rock in other portions of the
site indicate additional thermal features may still be present under extensive dune sediments
covering much of the site.
Low to moderate densities of artifacts are present on the site surface. The majority of surface
materials consist of pieces of burned caliche and fire-cracked rock; more than 150 such items
were observed scattered throughout the site. The remaining cultural materials include > 150 lithic
artifacts and > 40 El Paso Brownware and decorated ceramics. Lithic artifacts include mainly
flakes of a wide variety of cherts, rhyolites, and quartzite with some limestone and sandstone
pieces. A few formal and manufacturing lithic tools were also noted as well as ground stone
fragments that included a two-sided sandstone mano fragment and a rhyolite pestle fragment.
The presence of multiple thermal features distributed over a large area suggests that multiple
occupations are represented at the site. The presence of El Paso Brownware ceramics indicates
the presence of a Ceramic period component. The site has good preservation and several wellpreserved features in associated with statistically robust artifact assemblages. In addition, the site
offers potential for spatial analysis for the interpretation of settlement structure and occupational
history.

Isolated Finds
A total of 63 isolated finds was documented during the sample survey (Figure 13; Table 1). The
total includes 18 in the western depression zone (IO 1 - 15, 20, 21, and 52), 24 along the central
slope zone (IO 16 - 19, 22 - 32, 41 - 45, 53, 54, and 57 - 59), and 21 along the elevated ridge zone
(IO 33 - 40, 46 - 51, 55, 56, 60 - 63). The isolates include single thermal features (n = 20), one
El Paso Brownware “pot drop” (IO 2), various isolated artifacts, and several diffuse scatters of
burned caliche or fire-cracked rock.

Discussion
As set forth in the project Research Design, upon completion of the fieldwork various maps
and tables of transect data are to be reviewed and subjected to statistical analysis to provide a
quantitative estimate of the following:
(1) estimates of overall site densities within the three stratified survey zones
(2) estimates of the numbers of significant, SAL-eligible sites within the three stratified survey
zones
(3) a review of the archeological sensitivity of the bajo-margin environmental zone
Figure 14 provides an aerial view of the survey parcel and illustrates the systematic sample
survey transects, locations of isolated hearth features, and locations of the four multiple hearth
sites.

Estimation of Site Counts and Densities Based on the Sample Transect Survey
The sample reconnaissance survey utilized north-south transects systematically placed at 100 m
intervals across the parcel. This effectively provided an approximate 10% sample of the 640
acre project area. As noted in the preceding section, four multi-feature sites, 21 isolated hearth
features, and 42 isolated artifact occurrences were documented among the survey transects. We
could proceed to estimate total site and isolate counts within the parcel by simply multiplying the
abovementioned counts by a factor of 10, resulting in an estimate that approximately forty multifeature sites and 200 hearth feature isolates are present in the parcel. However, such an approach
is overly simplistic, carries an inherent bias towards overestimating site counts and, as a result,
may provide misleading information for the management and treatment of cultural resources in
the project area. A more refined approach takes into consideration issues of sampling efficiency,
site size, and observed site counts in the three stratified sample zones.
Sampling efficiency is based on the premise that surveys conducted using transect spacing of a
given interval will likely identify sites with diameters exceeding that interval, while smaller
diameter sites will be less likely to be encountered. For example, the majority of sites with
diameters of 100 m or greater are likely to be encountered while using transects of 100 m spacing,
by the simple fact that such sites will extend across one or two survey transects. In contrast, sites
measuring 50, 20, or 10 m in diameter may fall between survey transects, and thus the probability
of encountering such sites is reduced.
Probabilities may be formally estimated using the mathematical formula:
p=πr2/i2
where r is the radius of the site and i denotes the transect interval employed during the survey.
Based on the 100 m transect interval implemented during the current survey, the probability of
encountering sites of various dimensions is graphically illustrated in Figure 14 below.
Of course, this mathematical probability calculation is founded on the premise of perfectly shaped
round entities with equal diameters across both x and y axes. Human settlement and the resulting
archeological record we observe in the form of “sites” does not follow such perfect rules. A site
measuring 150 m or more along its north-south axis, but only 50 meters along the east-west axis,
could be missed on a survey using north-south oriented transect spaced at 100 m. However, the
probability curve in Figure 14 does provide a reasonable baseline estimate of the likelihood of a
site of given size being encountered during the current survey. As indicated in the figure, sites
having diameters of 100 m (50 m radius) have an 80% chance of being encountered during a
survey using 100 m transects. It is very likely that any sites measuring 120 m in diameter or
greater (60 m or greater radius) will be encountered. In contrast, smaller sites have increasingly
lower probabilities of being encountered. Sites measuring 40 m in diameter (20 m radius) have
only a 10% chance of being found among a series of transects spaced at 100 m.
Based on these probabilities, we can proceed to better estimate the counts of sites of various
dimensions in the project area. There are a couple of caveats before proceeding with estimating
site counts for the current survey project. First, for the statistical purist, it should be noted that
the formula and graph in Figure 14 illustrates the probability of a given site of a given size being
encountered, and accordingly could be viewed as an individual probability event that is
independent of other events. In other words, the statement that a given site measuring 100 m
diameter (50 m radius) had an 80% chance of being encountered using the present survey method

26

does not absolutely translate to a statement that the survey method has identified 80% of the sites
measuring 100 m in diameter. Nevertheless, the cumulative effect of independent probabilities is
close enough so that the probability values can be used as a general estimator.

Figure 14. Probability function graph illustrating the probability of encountering a site of a specific
size (radius) using a survey transect interval of 100 m.

Second, while transects were spaced at 100 m intervals, the archeological surveyors did not walk
along a straight, single line. Instead, survey corridors within individual transects measured 10 m
in width, or 5 m on either side of the transect line. This effectively provided coverage that
equates with 90 m transect spacing, with the result that site encounter probabilities should be
modified accordingly. Figure 15 below show the results of this modification.

27

Figure 15. Probability function graph illustrating the probability of encountering a site of a specific
size (radius) using a survey transect interval of 90 m.

Finally, another assumption underlying the probability calculations in Figures 14 and 15 is that
sites and material culture are randomly or systematically distributed across the survey parcel.
This is not the case, as it is clear that the counts of sites and isolated occurrences vary
considerably across the three geomorphic-topographic sampling subdivisions. Accordingly, an
accurate estimate of site counts must be based on the survey sample counts observed among the
individual sampling zones and then a cumulative total can be calculated.
With the foregoing considerations in mind, we may assume that the sample survey effectively
located approximately 80% of the sites measuring ≥100 m in diameter (≥50 m radius). However,
it is possible that the long axis of a site may extend along a north-south orientation to follow the
contours of the ridgeline, and that such a site may have been missed during examination of the
north-south transects. Therefore, although there is a chance that one more large site may have
been missed along the slope or ridge, the statistical probability of this is occurrence is low. There
is overall only a 20% chance of missing such a site altogether. Considering that two such large
sites were recorded, the overall chance of a third site being present is relatively low.
Two sites of intermediate size (ca. 30-50 m diameter, or 15-25 m radius) with 2 to 6 features were
recorded during the sample survey. Both are situated in the eastern ridge zone. It is estimated
that the two sites represent 15% of the total number that may be present within this zone, and thus
we estimate that a total of 15 intermediate sites are present.

28

Table 2 summarizes the estimated site counts by geomorphic-topographic sample zone. We
caution that these are estimates. We are concerned by the apparent absence of intermediate sites
in the central zone. If only one site had been encountered, we would estimate 7 would be present.
It is possible that upon closer inspection and 100% transect survey coverage that one or more of
the hearth isolates would have turned into an intermediate site. However, we would not
anticipate high counts of such sites.

Estimating the numbers of SAL-eligible sites within these totals is a much more difficult
proposition, because critical site content factors of assemblage content, artifact association with
hearth features, the numbers of hearth features present and so forth cannot be reliably estimated.
The third issue involving the archeological sensitivity of the bajo environments can be resolved.
It is apparent that the settlement intensity directly adjacent to bajos is limited and the geomorphic
integrity of sites will be generally poorer in this zone. In addition, the shallow nature of surface
deposits indicates that few large or intermediate sites will remain buried and undetected during
surface survey. Therefore, it is proposed that the archeological sensitivity of this zone is low. In
contrast, the results of recent survey work in similar terrains throughout the Hueco Bolson are
proving that elevated landforms adjacent to bajos and playas have been preferred prehistoric
settlement locations.
Geomorphic Context – Site Visibility and Bias
Surface artifact and feature distributions in the central Hueco Bolson are almost universally
conditioned by dynamic aeolian processes. In the current project area, while it is certain that
artifacts, features, and cultural deposits have been obscured and exposed by dunes, we do not feel
that the observed and estimated site counts have been affected to a large degree.
First and foremost is the observation that the western depression area leading to playas or bajos
has the greatest degree of surface erosion and has Holocene Q3 deposits of least depth, yet site
and feature densities are lowest in this area. No large or intermediate sites were observed during
the sample survey, and only five hearth isolates were noted, compared to 7 and 8 features in the
remaining geomorphic zones. There is no evidence of spatial clustering or segregation of these
hearth features that could be attributed to differential site burial and exposure. Examination of
Ripley’s L statistic (transformation of Ripley’s K statistic, after Dixon 2002; Ripley 1976, 1977)
and the Weigand-Moloney O-ring statistic (Wiegand and Maloney 2004; Wiegand et al. 1999)
detects no evidence of spatial clustering at any scale (Figure 16).

29

Figure 16.
Ripley’s L and Wiegand-Moloney O-ring tests for spatial randomness of isolated
hearth features in the survey parcel. Red symbol line represents L and O-ring values and
surrounding light grey lines represent 90% confidence intervals. The central grey line represents
values for a spatially random distribution. Values above this line indicate spatial clustering;
values below the line represent spatial segregation. Spatial scales on the x axis represent 100 m
intervals (1 = 100 m; 2= 200 m scales). In both cases, statistically significant departures from
spatial randomness do not occur at most spatial scales, with exceptions of very slight degrees of
greater spatial segregation at 500 m and 200 m for the L and O-ring tests, respectively.

This is not to claim that aeolian deposition has not affected site and feature visibility across the
parcel. Clearly, numerous hearth features and buried cultural occupational surfaces exist under
the extensive sheet sands and dune fields of the central slope and particularly the eastern terrace.
However, this study demonstrates that a systematic sample survey of the parcel has identified a
spatially random distribution of isolated hearths across the parcel, and thus suggests that the
isolated feature counts (and by extension, multiple hearth site counts) represent proportionally
representative sample estimates of the populations of such features that may be present in each
geomorphic-topographic zone.

Evaluations and Recommendations
State Archeological Landmark Eligibility Recommendations
Critical issues for evaluating the SAL eligibility of prehistoric sites in the survey parcel will be
based upon whether they retain sufficient integrity and research potential. Integrity and research
potential will be based on three aspects of the sites:
(1) Presence of discrete lithic and/or ceramic activity areas associated with dateable contexts
(2) Presence of features with sufficient integrity and cultural deposits to provide subsistence,
chronometric, and/or technological data
(3) Artifact assemblages of sufficient integrity, sample size, and discrete association with
dateable contexts to offer insights into lithic or ceramic technology and utilization of the
alluvial fan environmental zone during a specific time interval
Three issues are critically important for evaluating the SAL and NRHP eligibility of small
prehistoric Jornada Mogollon sites in the central basin landforms: (1) explicit and unambiguous
statements describing the integrity and research potential of features and activity areas; (2) the
research potential of artifact assemblages in terms of specific technological research issues; and
(3) the spatial arrangements and relationships of features and artifacts. Overall, the approach to
site eligibility evaluation and data recovery implemented by GMI over the preceding three years
includes investigations focused on the intra-site (feature/activity area and relationships of activity
areas) and landscape scales. Many sites in the Jornada region are best viewed as aggregates of
occupational episodes of differing intensity across the landscape. Accordingly, the discrete
associations of materials and features within portions of sites, and the relationships of these
associations within a broader landscape settlement perspective, will be the focus of analysis. To
develop appropriate contexts for evaluating the SAL eligibility of the sites in the central Hueco
Bolson, the following characteristics of each site should be taken into account:
•

Geomorphic observations, including the micro-topographic context of the site (presence
of advanced coppice dunes with severe interdunal erosional surfaces, the presence or
absence of lag gravels in surface sands of limited depth, presence of sheet sands or dune
piles) and an estimate of whether substantial subsurface cultural deposits are present.

•

The subsurface potential and research significance of the site in terms of the probability
of significant cultural deposits, features, or artifact concentrations remaining buried and
undetected through surface observations, as well as a general estimate of their extent and
integrity.

•

The spatial character of a site is important. Field observations will determine whether
artifacts and features are clustered and therefore have a fundamental provenience
association, or whether materials are highly dispersed and scattered across the site area.
General observations will also be made in an attempt to estimate whether a site represents
an aggregate of multiple, isolated features and activity areas or if it potentially represents
a more coherent and temporally bounded settlement.

Four prehistoric multiple-hearth sites were documented during the survey. Based on the presence
of multiple hearth features with preserved organic deposits, associated artifact assemblages, and
potential horizontal integrity and potential for spatial analysis, it is recommended that sites
41EP5807 and 41EP5808 meet the research design eligibility thresholds and accordingly warrant

31

formal designation as SALs.
We find no evidence to alter the previous recommendation
(Peterson and Willis 2001) regarding 41EP5542, and agree that this site warrants formal
designation as an SAL.
Site 41EP5809 contains only two surface hearth features. Although it is possible that additional
features may be buried under deposits of sheet sands, the associated artifact assemblage at this
site provides minimal technological or spatial information. Accordingly, it is recommended that
41EP5809 does not warrant formal designation as an SAL.
Recommendations for PSF Tract # 104934
Based on the previous discussions, the following recommendations are provided for consideration
of the proposed sale of PSF Tract 104934:
(1) The western 1/3 of the parcel has a low probability of significant archeological resources
being present. No further archeological survey or subsurface work is recommended for this area
of PSF Tract 104934.
(2) The central slope area has a moderate probability of archeological sites, although it is felt that
that the majority of large, multiple hearth sites with extensive artifact assemblages have been
documented through the sample survey. It is recommended that appropriate treatment plan be
devised for SAL-eligible site 41EP5807, but that otherwise no further archeological survey or
subsurface work is recommended for this area of PSF Tract 104934.
(3) The eastern ridge or terrace has the greatest archeological potential. It is recommended that
an appropriate treatment plan be developed for SAL-eligible sites 41EP5808 and 41EP5542. If a
second sample survey were to be conducted on this portion of the PSF tract utilizing 50 m
transect intervals, there is a 100% probability that large sites of ≥100 m diameter would be
encountered, and an 80% probability that sites in the intermediate-size grouping would be
discovered.
