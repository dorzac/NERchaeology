ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of a 1.73 miles (4.2 acres) water line in central Brazos
County, Texas was conducted in December 2003 by Brazos Valley Research Associates
(BVRA) of Bryan, Texas under Texas Antiquities Permit 3300. The Principal Investigator
was William E. Moore. One previously recorded historic site (41BZ139) is located within
the route of the project area and was visited by the survey crew. This site was originally
described as not significant, and this study agrees with that assessment. Additional work is
not recommended at this site. No new archaeological sites were found in the project area,
and it is recommended that the Wellborn Special Utility District be allowed to proceed with
construction as planned. Copies of the report are on file at the Texas Historical
Commission (THC); the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL); the Wellborn
Special Utility District; and BVRA.

INTRODUCTION
BVRA was retained by the Wellborn Special Utility District through J. F. Fontaine &
Associates, Inc. of Palestine, Texas to conduct an archaeological survey for the proposed
Wellborn Special Utility District Number 2003 Project in central Brazos County (Figure 1).
The project area is depicted on United States Geological Survey topographical maps
Chances Store dated 1962, photorevised 1980 (Figure 2) and Wellborn dated 1961,
photorevised 1980 (Figure 3). The proposed water supply line is 2.84 miles in length with a
permanent easement of 20 feet. The actual area surveyed is 1.73 miles or 4.2 acres. It
begins at State Highway 60 and Jones Road and terminates at Hopes Creek Road. The
route of the proposed water supply line traverses private land and property owned by
Texas A&M University. The line crosses White Creek, a major stream in the county, which
runs into the Brazos River. A 12 inch pipe will be placed in a 24 inch wide trench with an
average depth of 4 feet. The Federal regulatory agency involved in this project is the
United States Department of Agriculture, Rural Development. It was also subject to review
at the State level by the THC. Since the construction of this project is being financed by a
local municipality and crosses State of Texas property, an Antiquities Permit was required.
Permit number 3300 was assigned to this project.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
According to a recently published planning document for the Eastern Planning
Region of Texas (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 1.1.2), Brazos County is situated
within the Southeast Texas archeological study region. In 1985, according to the planning
document (Biesaart et al. 1985:114), Brazos County contained 33 recorded sites. In 1985,
0 sites in the county had been excavated, 0 had been tested by hand, and 33 had been
surface collected. Two recorded prehistoric sites in the county were listed as Paleoindian,
1 was listed as General Archaic, and 1 was listed as Late Prehistoric (Biesaart et al.
1985:114). The archaeological potential of Brazos County is reflected in part by the
increasing number of recorded sites found as a result of cultural resource management
studies. As a result of these investigations, the number of recorded sites now stands at
157 (TARL site records). A check of the records at TARL in Austin, Texas revealed three
archeological studies have been conducted in close proximity to the current project area.
One site (41BZ139) is within the path of the water supply line.
In 1992, archaeologists from the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB)
(Whitsett and Jurgens 1992) conducted an archaeological survey on property owned by
Texas A&M University and the Conlee Brothers. They recorded six sites (41BZ112 41BZ117) and recommended an intensive survey of an additional 102 acre tract not
covered by their survey. This tract is the site of a sludge disposal area and water treatment
plant. They also recommended that significance testing be conducted at 41BZ112 and
41BZ115 and archival research be performed historic site 41BZ115. They described three
sites (41BZ112 â 41BZ114) as sparse lithic scatters that are potentially significant), and
two sites (41BZ116 and 41BZ117) as lithic procurement areas that are not significant. Site
41BZ115 is a historic site with a small lithic scatter, and it is also described as potentially
significant. It is located very close to the current project area (Appendix I), and it is
described below.
41BZ115
This site was recorded by W. Hayden Whitsett and Chris Jurgens of the TWDB in
1992. It is on a prominent hill on the east bank of White Creek on and along the top and
slopes of a ridge line overlooking the floodplain. The hill on which the site is located is
defined on the site form (no formal report written) by TWDB archaeologists as a sandy clay
ridgeline overlooking the floodplain to the north. Small tributaries flank the ridge and flow
into White Creek. This site was found to contain at least two structures. One was
represented by scattered sandstone blocks, brick from a chimney, and a surface scatter of
historic artifacts. This site may date from the turn-of-the-century to the 1930s or later. A
second was represented by a collapsed chimney and sandstone blocks. Based on historic
artifacts at the site it is believed it may date to the late 19th century. A sparse scatter of
lithic debitage was also observed on the surface within the site area.
5

In 1992, archaeologists from the Archaeological Research Laboratory, Texas A&M
University surveyed the 102 acre tract recommended by TWDB personnel. One historic
site (41BZ118) was identified and recorded. This site consisted of piles of bricks,
sandstone blocks, and household debris. It is believed that 41BZ118 dates to the early
20th century. According to the site form this site is potentially eligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places or as a State Archeological Landmark. In addition,
significance testing was conducted at 41BZ112 and 41BZ115. Archival research was
performed for 41BZ115.
Excavation at 41BZ115 consisted of seven 50 x 50 cm test units and four backhoe
trenches. The prehistoric component of this site yielded a low density of cultural materials
primarily within the upper 30 cm. The researchers view the assemblage as indicative of a
lithic tool manufacturing area and describe it as a component of a widespread, low-density
lithic procurement and manufacturing area that extends into the uplands beyond the
boundaries of their project area. No intact features were found. Although the work
conducted at the lithic scatters by A&M archaeologists produced useful information about
past land-use patterns, they believe that additional surface collections, excavations, or
analyses would yield new information important in prehistory. Therefore, they view the
prehistoric component at 41BZ115 as not eligible for listing in the National Register of
Historic Places or as a State Archeological Landmark. The historic component at 41BZ115
is believed to be part of a complex of sites occupied by an African American family during
the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This component is unusual in that there is
considerable historical documentation available, living descendants of the original
occupant, and aerial photography that distinctly illustrates the site layout and structures and
its archaeological deposits appear to have sufficient integrity to yield additional important
information about post-Civil War African American land-use practices and material culture.
Therefore, it is considered to be eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic
Places and as a State Archeological Landmark.
In 2001, Victor J. Galan of Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants in
Nacogdoches, Texas conducted an archaeological survey of a proposed Texas A&M
University Student Retreat Center (240 acres). This study identified and recorded three
archaeological sites (41BZ137 - 41BZ139). Sites 41BZ137 and 41BZ138 are prehistoric
open campsites, while site 41BZ139 is a historic farmstead dating to the 20th century. Site
41BZ139 is located within the route of the water supply line as proposed by the Wellborn
Special Utility District (Appendix I). At the time of its discovery by Galan, this site consisted
of a chimney foundation and early to middle 20th century artifacts on the surface. Nearby
were numerous Iris plants obviously brought to this location by the inhabitants of the
farmstead.

Typically, archaeological sites in Brazos County are found on sandy hills
overlooking creeks and rivers where water and other resources were available. An
example is site 41BZ132. At this site, shovel testing and backhoe trenching produced
flakes, burned rock, and a Carrollton dart point that dates to the Middle Archaic period,
circa 2000 B.C. to 1200 B.C. Examination of the site by the geo-archaeologist determined
that the cultural materials were found in a deep sandy mantle (Moore 2000). This site was
not viewed as significant.
Upland sites within the sandy mantle are also present in the county. At 41BZ133, a
number of flakes were found buried in a deep sandy mantle at an elevation of 332 feet, well
above the nearest stream (Moore 2000). Seventy-nine chert flakes were recovered for an
average of 4.93 flakes per positive test. Artifacts were found in nine levels (0-90 cm). No
features or temporally diagnostic artifacts were found. This site was not viewed as
significant.
Work by the above-mentioned archaeological studies suggests archaeological sites
may be present on hills containing primarily clay soils such as 41BZ115 near the current
project area. It should be noted, however, that a sandy mantle (although perhaps thin) was
probably present on this hill in prehistoric times. If this is true, it could have eroded causing
a deflated surface upon which the artifacts were resting at the time this site was visited by
archaeologists. That some artifacts at 41BZ115 were found at 30 cm below the existing
ground surface does not mean that they were originally buried in the upper part of the clay
stratum. Turbation through plowing could easily account for the downward movement of
cultural materials.
It is beyond the scope of this report to discuss in detail the archaeological
background of Brazos County, especially when numerous contract reports are available.
The interested reader is referred to the statistical overview (Biesaart et al. 1985), the
planning document published by the THC (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993), and the in-depth
report by Thoms (1993) for more detailed information regarding the archaeology of Brazos
County.

METHODS
Prior to entering the field, a records check for previously recorded sites in the project
area and vicinity was conducted. No previously recorded sites were found to be within the
area to be surveyed. Several archaeological studies in the area were noted.
The project area was examined on December 16 and 17, 2003 utilizing the
pedestrian survey method supported by shovel testing. Based on a review of the
topographic maps, two low probability areas were eliminated from the field survey. This
reduced the distance to be examined from 2.84 miles to 1.73 miles (4.2 acres). The field
crew consisted of the Principal Investigator (William E. Moore) and the Project
Archaeologist (Edward P. Baxter). The entire project area was walked with shovel testing
being performed at high probability areas and randomly along the length of the water
supply line route. Although much of the project area was covered with various grasses and
other plants, there were areas where surface exposure approximated 100%. In these
areas, gravels were often present. The survey crew carefully examined these locations for
the presence of displaced cultural materials. Another area of excellent exposure was the
creek bank at White Creek. The creek bed and gravel bars were examined, and the creek
banks were scraped with a shovel.
Since the project area is in the uplands, there were no active floodplains suitable for
backhoe trenching. Therefore, shovel testing was the best way to look for buried sites.
Virtually the entire length of the project area traversed hills with clay at or near the surface.
All tests except one were dug to clay, and the size of each test was 30 centimeters in
diameter and varied in depth from 10 to 100 centimeters below the existing ground surface.
All excavated fill was screened through 1/4 inch hardware cloth. Data obtained from
shovel testing were recorded on a shovel test log (Appendix II). In all, 34 shovel tests were
dug, and each test was backfilled. Approximate locations of the shovel tests are depicted
on the topographic maps in figures 2 and 3.
At the White Creek crossing, the water supply line will pass beneath the creek
through directional boring. The boring will begin and end approximately 200 feet from the
creek bank. If buried sites are present at the edge of the creek they will not be affected by
this activity.
At the time of this survey, only historic site 41BZ139 was found to be in close
proximity to the route of the water supply line. According to the plotting at TARL, this site is
located on the opposite side of the road from the path of the water supply line route.
However, the pedestrian survey identified domestic iris plants near the road, a red flag for
the presence of a historic site. After a check of the UTM coordinates for 41BZ139, it was
determined that this site was in the vicinity of the iris plants.

8

A check of the area located a pile of brick that may be the remains of a chimney.
When the site form was checked it was learned that site 41BZ139 is in our project area and
had been incorrectly plotted on the TARL maps. The findings of iris plants and bricks were
consistent with the site form. We did not shovel test at this site or enlarge its boundary. In
the field we determined that this site is not significant and additional work was not
warranted.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The field survey located previously recorded historic site 41BZ139 within the path of
the water supply line as proposed by the Wellborn Special Utility District. This site
appeared to be in the same condition as when recorded in 2001. No unrecorded sites
were found within the current project area. Overall, the project area traverses hills and
slopes containing clay at or near the surface. Deep sand was encountered at the White
Creek crossing; however, directional boring beneath the creek will be utilized in order to
avoid damage to the creek and its environs. Any sites within this sandy mantle will not be
affected. The shallow clays within the project area are a signal that only surface prehistoric
sites are likely. All of the gravels observed were quite small and are not viewed as suitable
resources for arrow or dart point manufacture. It is possible that sparse lithic scatters and
procurement sites are present in the general area, but no evidence of these site types was
observed. It is, therefore, concluded that the route of the water supply line (except for site
41BZ139) does not pass through any prehistoric or historic sites.

10

RECOMMENDATIONS
It is the opinion of BVRA that there are no significant archaeological sites within the
route of the water supply line. Historic site 41BZ139 is located within the project area;
however, this site was not considered by the original recorders as eligible for listing on the
National Register of Historic Places, an opinion shared by BVRA. It is recommended that
construction be allowed to proceed as planned. It is always possible that archaeological
sites are missed during any cultural resources survey. Should any evidence of an
archaeological site be encountered during construction of the proposed water supply line,
work in the area of the find should cease until assessed by a professional archaeologist in
consultation with the THC and the Wellborn Special Utility District.
