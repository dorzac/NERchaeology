ABSTRACT
In May 2005, DETAC (Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultant) conducted a
cultural resources survey of the Eason Lake Well Field near Diboll, Texas. The project
included 16.1 kilometers (km) (10 miles) of collection pipelines, five water well
locations, a Chlorination Facility, and powerlines to the well locations. Both the
pipelines and powerlines were placed in easements roughly 9 m (30 ft) wide. Pipelines
were 6, 10, and 12 inch in diameter and powerlines included single wooden support poles.
The 5 well pads in project area were roughly 46 meters square (150 ft square) each, and the
Chlorination plant was roughly 90 meters square (300 ft square) or 0.8 hectares (2 acres).
All pipe trenches were excavated to between 75 and 90 centimeters (cm) (30 and 36
inches). Visual examination and shovel tests were employed at required intervals in
designated low and high probability areas. Shovel testing adequately explored the width
and depth of the proposed impacts. Three new archaeological sites were identified during
the survey. All three were lithic artifact scatters on sandy landforms adjacent to surface
water sources. No cultural features were observed in shovel tests. The potential for
encountering cultural features on any of the sites was determined to be low because of the
deep loose nature of the sandy soils with abundant root disturbances observed on the sites.
None of the sites yielded artifacts diagnostic of a particular cultural phase. The recovered
artifacts were curated at the Stephen F. Austin State University Anthropology Laboratory
in Nacogdoches, Texas. DETAC requests a determination of “no effect” for the proposed
development of the Eason Lake Well Field.

INTRODUCTION
In May 2005, DETAC (Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultant) conducted a cultural
resources survey of the Eason Lake Well Field for KSA Engineers, Inc (Figure 1). The well field
includes 5 water well locations, one chlorination facility, and 16.1 kilometers (10 miles) of
collection pipelines 6, 10, and 12 inch in diameter. This well field will be managed by the City of
Diboll, Texas. Cultural resource management was required because the Water Development Board
delegated the responsibility to the consulting engineering company to contract a cultural resource
specialist. In addition, the project falls under a Nationwide permit for wetlands delineation. Texas
Antiquities Permit #3757 was obtained and all terms of the permit were carried out.
The 5 well pads in project area are roughly 46 meters square (150 ft square) each, the
Chlorination plant is roughly 0.8 hectares (2 acres), and the easement consists of six segments of
new water lines and powerlines roughly 9 m (30 ft) wide. All pipe trenches will be excavated to
between 75 and 90 centimeters (cm) (30 and 36 inches). Shovel testing investigated the area of
potential impact sufficiently (Figure 2).
Three new archaeological sites were identified during the survey. All three were lithic
artifact scatters on sandy landforms adjacent to water sources. No cultural features were observed
in shovel tests. None of the sites yielded artifacts diagnostic of a particular cultural phase. The
potential for encountering cultural features on any of the sites was determined to be low because of
the deep, loose, nature of the sandy soils and abundant root disturbances observed on all three sites.
Based on fieldwork and archival research, DETAC recommends a determination of “no effect” to
cultural resources for the Eason Lake Well Field.
All fieldwork was conducted by Victor Galan, Principal Investigator.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The study area for the proposed waterline project falls within the Eastern Timbered Plain
Physiographic Province of east Texas. This province is part of the larger Gulf Coastal Plain
(Bureau of Economic Geology (BEG), 1970, 1977) and the Austroriparian biotic province. The
Austroriparian biotic province is typified by extensive pine and hardwood forests, swamps,
marshes, and other hydric communities (Blair 1950).
The Gulf Coastal Plain is an elevated former sea bottom (Hunt 1974) formed during the
Cenozoic Era when cycles of transgression and regression of the ancestral Gulf of Mexico
deposited sands, shales, clays, and marls in sedimentary geologic formations. More-resistant strata
form escarpments or cuestas with rolling hills and prairies (Fisher 1965). The streams that flow
through these hills and prairies typically have floodplains 1.6 to 16 km (1 to 10 miles) wide. These
floodplains generally occur 30.5 to 46 m (100 to 150 ft) below the regular elevation of the land
creating narrower floodplains where streams cut through the cuestas.
The geologic units in the area includes the Eocene age Yeuga Formation on the upland
settings from the chlorination plant toward the City of Diboll, the Pleistocene age Quaternary
terrace deposits on the uplands overlooking the Neches River floodplain, and Quaternary Alluvium
in the floodplain. The Yegua Formation consists of clay and quartz sand in the upper part with
lignite in the lower part. Quaternary terrace deposits include ancient river deposits between 1.8
mya and 11,000 years old. Quaternary Alluvium includes more recent stream channel, back
swamp, natural levee, and point bar areas (BEG, 1968). In a Geoarchaeological context, the
Quaternary Alluvium deposits have the most realistic chance of containing deeply buried
archaeological sites as the Yegua Formation is definitely to old and Quaternary terraces are
probably too old. Dating individual terrace deposits is necessary to assess the potential for older
sites in this portion of the Neches River valley. Two factors prohibit a complete investigation of
the Quaternary terraces: First, an understanding of the true age of the terraces requires a level of
investigation beyond this survey’s scope of work, and Second, the depth of the Area of Potential
Effect is within shovel testing depth for the entire right-of-way.

Given the depth of the proposed impacts, the Angelina County Soil Survey (2004) provides
adequate information of the depth and nature of the surface material. Soil descriptions in the
manual for the series along the right-of-way were examined for information about the matrix,
potential for buried horizons, formation processes, and potential age of the parent material. Soils
along the project area range from shallow fine sandy loam (highest elevation) to deeper fine sandy
loams (medium elevations) to dense loams and clays (lower elevations). These soils conform
geomorphic setting of the immediate area: the oldest unit (Yegua Formation of quartz sand and
clay) is dissected by Quaternary deposits in two episodes with the terraces (sandy deposits) being
the older of the two and the modern deposits (sandy loam and clay) in the active floodplain. Soils
generally deepen closer to the bottom land. Shallower Rosenwall soils are found at the highest
elevations near the city of Diboll while deeper sandy Attoyac, Bernaldo, Fuller, Keltys like soils
are found on the edges of the terraces near the active floodplain. Koury, Osias and Popher soils are
frequently flooded clays and loams found in the active floodplain and sloughs.

CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY
The Cultural Chronology is divided into Paleo-Indian, Archaic, Early Ceramic, Late
Prehistoric, and Historic periods.

Each period was delineated by a change in environment,

technology, and/or population requiring adaptations to meet varying circumstances. Each period is
described in reference to the cultural phases within the period, settlement patterns, subsistence, and
artifacts associated with the period.
Paleo-Indian Period
The Paleo-Indian period (prior to 6000 B.C.) is the earliest generally accepted cultural
period in the New World and includes populations that inhabited North America from the Late
Pleistocene to the early Holocene.

Paleo-Indian sites are typified by scattered Clovis,

Scottsbluff, Dalton, San Patrice, and Plainview projectile points, these sites are rare in the
region. Overall, tool types are generally carefully fashioned bifacal and unifacial tools. The use
of non-local materials and recycling lead Story (1990) to suggest this population was organized
into small, mobile bands of hunters and gatherers that consumed a variety of plants and animals.
Paleo-Indian artifacts recovered in the region suggested that early occupations were principally
distributed in the valleys of major stream basins (Perttula 1995). However, observed sites from
the Paleo-Indian period are less frequent in active floodplains because of the changes in the
landscape since those periods (Waters 1992:151).
Archaic
The Archaic (6000-400 B.C.) refers to hunter-gatherers who implemented more regionally
specialized approaches toward exploiting their environment. The Archaic period is represented by
three divisions: the Early, Middle, and Late Archaic during which tool technology progressed from
the large points that typify the Paleo-Indian period to the use of sand and grog tempered ceramics
and the bow and arrow in the Early Ceramic and Late Prehistoric. Later Archaic sites are more
abundant than earlier sites as populations shifted from major streams to minor streams and natural
springs (Story 1990). This greater number and distribution of Late Archaic sites suggests the
successful adaptation to the environment lasting until the development of pottery and/or the
development of the bow and arrow. Stone-lined hearths, baking pits, milling implements, and
6

polished stone serve as indicators of new technologies (Story 1990:213). When compared to
Paleo-Indian artifacts, Archaic lithic assemblages are more functionally varied; however, tool types
are generally less well made and of more local materials than the Paleo-Indian period. Cemeteries
date to the Archaic period as well (Story 1990). Projectile point types associated with the Archaic
period include Gary, Elam, Edgewood, Ellis, and Yarbrough.
Early Ceramic Period
The Early Ceramic (200 B.C.-A.D. 800) period (Story 1990:293), also referred to as the
Woodland period (Perttula et al. 1986), represented an increasing utilization of the environment. A
number of characteristic innovations appear during the Early Ceramic period. In particular, there is
a greater reliance on cultigens along with larger and more prolonged occupations at specific
locales.

The technological innovation appearing during the Early Ceramic period was the

widespread production of pottery and the introduction of the bow and arrow very late in the period
(Story et al. 1990; Thurmond 1990). Pottery, or at least the surface decorations, were probably
introduced from the Lower Mississippi Valley as Marksville Stamped, Marksville Incised,
Tchefuncte Stamped, Troyville Stamped, and Chrupa Incised have been found along the Sabine
River (Story 1990; Thurmond 1988; Cliff et al. 1994:23). Gary and Kent projectile points were
made smaller and lighter and corner-notched arrow points enter the archaeological record at this
period as well (Thrumond 1990).
Late Prehistoric Period
In the Late Prehistoric period (A.D. 800-1680) Angelina County serves as a boundary
between the Caddoan culture to the north and the Atakapain Bidias to the south. The Caddo
culture was an indigenous development strongly influenced by the Mississippian tradition of the
Lower Mississippi Valley (Story 1990:323; Wycoff 1971) while the Bidias cultural development
was strongly influenced by the Gulf Coast Goose Creek tradition around 200 B.C. or from the
Tchefuncte complex in western Louisiana. Caddo subsistence and social organization differed
markedly from the Archaic and Early Ceramic periods as horticulture supplemented hunting and
gathering followed by a diet dominated by maize, beans, and squash.

Increasingly larger

aggregates of people became sedentary and constructed villages with public ceremonial areas. A
stratified social structure developed, corresponding to the chiefdom level as first defined by Service
7

(1962, 1975). Extensive commercial networks were also established with hamlets and farmsteads
surrounding larger community mound center. Settlements were mainly distributed on elevated
landforms adjacent to major streams, as well as along minor tributaries and spring-fed branches.
The Late Prehistoric Period has been divided into Formative, Early, Middle, and Late Caddoan
phases. The phases indicate changes in socio-political, habitation, and material culture. Overall,
the Late Prehistoric Period is typified by a variety of arrowpoints, ground stone artifacts, and a
ceramic vessel types. Smith (1995:14) describes the Bidias as less advanced as the Caddo in
material culture and subsistence strategies relying less on agriculture and more on the
hunting/gathering traditions of there Atakapain ancestors. Distinguishing the two cultures in a
cultural boundary relies on analysis of the ceramic collection. Schafer and others (1975:251)
provides examples of the similarities and differences between the two ceramic traditions based on
manufacture technique.
Historic
Angelina was initially inhabited by Anglo settlers in the 1820’s and 1830’s but was not
recognized as a separate county until 1846 when Nacogdoches County was divided. Increasing
numbers of Americans came to the area increasing the population of farmers and their slaves as the
land was planted in cotton in the 1850’s.

The second largest industry was livestock.

Transportation of crops and animals initially involved travel along the Angelina and Neches rivers;
however, it changed to the East and West Railway between Houston and Shreveport in the 1890’s.
After the Civil War, Angelina County farmers changed from livestock to lumber as the population
decreased. The population quickly increased again with the popularity of southern pine as a
building material. Associated sawmills and railroad lines were built to support the growing
industry. The Great Depression affected the lumber industry forcing Angelina County residence to
return to raising livestock and subsistence farming. After the depression, Angelina County steadily
grew as the lumber industry returned, raising livestock became more popular, and timber related
industry was introduced to the area. (Webb, 1952)

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
A review of the official site location maps and files at TARL and the Texas Archaeological
Site Atlas (Texas Historical Commission (THC) 2005) revealed that the majority of the studies near
the project area were conducted in the uplands along either side of the Neches River bottoms. The
closest investigation to the project area along the Neches River is a 1997 survey conducted for the
Ft. Worth Corps of Engineers. At its closest, the survey is roughly 300 m (985 ft) southwest of the
project area near Mossy Ridge. Other surveys near the project area were conduced for the Davy
Crockett national Forest in Trinity County on the west side of the Neches River.

Eight

archaeological sites are recorded along the Neches River in Trinity County in similar settings to the
project area. Sites on the west side of the river are 41TN26 (Ippolito 1981), 41TN51 (Skiles 1992),
41TN66, and 41TN91 (Hubbard 1994). All four of these sites are Late Prehistoric occupations
found on low sandy landforms. Within Diboll there are several historical markers to include the
Thomas Lewis Latane Temple house, the Old City Library, the Southern Pine Lumber Company
Commissary, and the First Methodist Church. None of which will be impacted by the proposed
development.
In addition to the fieldwork referenced above, several recent documents have added
significantly to information on the archaeological record in this region. The document of primary
importance is D.A. Story's (1990) and J.A. Guy's (1990) discussions of the Gulf Coastal Plain.
Additionally, the Texas Historical Commission, Department of Antiquities Protection developed a
document for the east Texas portion of the Texas State Plan (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993). This
document includes several historic contexts each of which deals with a particular facet of northeast
Texas prehistory. This plan serves to synthesize the current state of archaeological research in the
region and identify problems and objectives to be addressed in future research and cultural
resources management.

Several weak areas in archaeological knowledge of the region are

identified in these recent studies.

Chronology, settlement patterns, subsistence, and historic

continuities are some of the general research directions that all of these recent syntheses emphasize
as important for developing future archaeological research designs.

SURVEY DESIGN
Before initiating fieldwork, DETAC conducted a records and literature review using the
Texas Archaeological Site Atlas (THC 2005) based on maps and files at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL), J.J. Pickle Research Campus, UT. The site location maps and
cultural resources records at TARL were consulted to identify the location, types, and both State
Archaeological Landmarks (SAL) and NRHP eligibility of previously recorded sites within or in
close proximity to the project areas. The Site Atlas also contains information about published
and unpublished data regarding cultural resource surveys.
DETAC performed these investigations in compliance with the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966 (Public Law [PL] 89-665), as amended in 1974 (PL 97-442), 1976 and
1980; the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL 81-190, 83 Stat. 915, 42 USC 4321,
1970); Procedures for the Protection of Historic and Cultural Properties (36 CFR 800); the
Archeological Resources protection Act of 1979; and the other appropriate cultural resources
legislation and guidelines. The investigations also complied with the procedural rules of the
Texas Antiquities Code.
High and low probability areas were determined by combining the previous site
information with topographic and soils data to aid in the survey. Topographic and soils data
suggests archaeological sites are more likely to be found on level landforms with deep welldrained soils as these environments provide dryer conditions for year-round occupation (Galan
1996; 1997). Sites in seasonally wet areas are typically more ephemeral occupations and are
frequently destroyed by annual flooding and stream channel migration.
The information gathered from the previous investigations and the soils data allowed the
survey areas to be divided into high and low probability areas. In general, areas within the active
flood plain have clayey soils while areas outside of the annual flood plain retain sandy matrix
and therefore have a higher probability of containing cultural resources. In addition, those areas
further from reliable water have a lower potential for containing cultural resources as prehistoric
populations were reliant on surface water. This model suggests those areas with sandy soils
10

adjacent to reliable surface water have the highest potential for site development and
preservation while sites seasonally flooded areas are easily destroyed and few sites will be found
further from reliable water sources. Figure 3 illustrates high and low probability areas based on
topographic and soils information for the project area. Low probability areas include the clayey
soils along Long Slough, the crest of the wide ridge north of Long Slough, and the upland areas
more than 100 m (330 ft) from water on the uplands south of Long Slough. High probability
areas include the sandy soils near the paleo-channels in the northern section and the marginal
sandy soils overlooking Long Slough and the intermittent drainages that dissect the uplands
south of the slough.
A 100 percent pedestrian inspection of the project area was conducted using visual
examination and shovel testing. Surface inspection included a visual examination of any exposed
surface in the ROW to include recent utility excavations, slope erosion, cutbanks, and animal
disturbances. Shovel test were approximately 30 cm (11.1 in) in diameter in areas of obscured
ground visibility excavating in 10-centimeter (cm) increments to clay or to 85 cm.
For each archaeological site recorded, DETAC completed several field procedures.
Initially, the area surrounding the newly located site was intensely inspected and shovel tests were
placed on the landform to define the spatial boundaries and vertical depth of the deposits of the site.
All sites were plotted on 7.5’ USGS topographic quadrangle maps. All information was recorded
on a standard Texas Archaeological Site Form (TexSite v. 2.0). Field sketch maps were completed
for all sites and color photographs were taken of a representative soil profile.
photographs were recorded on standard DETAC/TARL photographic logs.

RESULTS
The Texas Archaeological Site Atlas (THC 2005) was consulted for the locations of known
or potential NRHP properties in accordance with the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966
(PL 89-665) as amended in 1974 (PL 94-442) and 1981 (PL 96-515). Forth NRHP houses are
listed for Angelina County. These NRHP sites lay outside the project area. The files at TARL
listed 185 previously recorded sites in Angelina County. Of the previously recorded sites, four
were listed as State Archaeological Landmarks. None of the previously recorded sites were found
to be within 3.6 kilometers (2 miles) of the project area. For reporting purposes, the project area
was divided into six segments and the Chlorination Facility.

Each description includes the

proposed development (to include well locations), the topographic setting, vegetation, soils,
modern impacts, and shovel test information.

Newly documented archaeological sites are

discussed in a separate section after the segment descriptions.
Segment 1
Segment 1 is a new powerline right-of-way. The powerline will connect to existing
service on the crest of a narrow ridge in the Neches River floodplain, extend roughly 950 m
(3110 ft) along an existing improved gravel road, and connect to the proposed pipeline right-ofway (Figure 4). The powerline support will be a single pole in a 9 m (30 ft) wide right-of-way.
Existing modern impacts to the area are limited to the construction of an improved gravel road
with cut ditches on either side of the road and a raised bed. The ridge is the remains of a sandy
Quaternary Terrace deposit with Attoyac fine sandy loam 30 cm (12 inches) deep over a clay Bt
horizon and sandy parent material. No buried soils were observed in a profile near the northern
limit of the right-of-way (Figure 5a). The remainder of the powerline segment consists of
Pophers silty clay loam for the majority of the segment and Bernaldo-Besner Complex soils at
the southern end near Segment 2 and the pipeline right-of-way. Pophers soils consist of silty clay
loam over clay and the Bernaldo-Besner Complex soils consist of roughly 35 cm (14 inches) of
fine sandy loam over clay. Vegetation along the segment is exclusively mixed hardwood and
pine forest with moderate to dense understory. A high water table dominates the area between
the ridge and the pipeline right-of-way. Ponds are frequent and are filled with water even during
drier time of the year. Powerline poles will be placed in the roadway fill. The cut bank and

exposed surfaces along the ridge were visually inspected. Only six shovel tests were excavated
because of the high water table and minimal impact from powerline poles in the road bed. None
of the power poles will be placed outside the existing road bed. Shovel tests focused on the
northern end of the powerline along the ridge and at the southern end where the soils were drier
and sandier. Shovel test locations are depicted in Figure 4 and data is presented in Table 1.

No cultural material was found in the surface inspection or shovel testing efforts.
DETAC requests concurrence with a determination of “no effect” to NRHP eligible cultural
resources because of the lack of artifacts existing impacts, and the proposed impacts are limited
to power pole locations and clearing vegetation. No further work is recommended because of
the minimal proposed impacts from power pole placement for Segment 1.
Segment 2 and Well 4
Segment 2 is a new powerline and 6 inch pipeline right-of-way. The power and pipe
lines will connect Well 4 to the main line in the Neches River floodplain. This segment will
extend roughly 302 m (992 ft) along an existing unimproved dirt road, and connect to the
proposed pipeline right-of-way (Figure 4). The easement will be a 9 m (30 ft) wide right-ofway. Well 4 is a 46 m2 (150 ft2) location at the southern end of Segment 2. Vegetation for both
the segment and the well pad include mixed bottom land with pine and hardwood trees and a
moderate to dense understory. Soils is an the area include Bernaldo-Besner Complex at the well
location and along the southern two-thirds of the right-of-way and Osais silty clay near a stream
channel remnant at the northern end of the right-of-way. The Osais soils were flooded at the
time of the survey. Shovel tests were excavated on the drier Bernaldo-Besner Complex soils to
the south. Shovel test locations are depicted in Figure 4 and data is presented in Table 2.

Table 2. Segment 2 Shovel Test Data.
No cultural material was found in the surface inspection of the unimproved dirt road or
shovel testing efforts. Shovel testing adequately explored the width and depth of the proposed
impacts. DETAC requests concurrence with a determination of “no effect” to NRHP eligible
cultural resources and no further work is recommended because of the lack of artifacts.
Segment 3, Wells 1, 2, and 3 Alternate
Segment 3 is a new powerline and 10 inch pipeline right-of-way along an existing
improved gravel road in the Neches River floodplain and onto an upland ridge. The well
locations are adjacent to the road surface. This segment will extend roughly 4 km (2.5 miles)
along an existing improved gravel road connecting the well locations to the main pipeline
adjacent to a railroad track (Figure 4). The easement will be a 9 m (30 ft) wide right-of-way
which include the powerline and pipeline (Figure 2a). Well 1 is a 46 x 91 m (150 x 300 ft)
location midway between Well 2 and Well 3 Alternate. Well 2 is a 46 m2 (150 ft2) location at
the southern end of Segment 3. Well 3 Alternate is a 46 m2 (150 ft2) location in the middle of
the right-of-way segment. Precise locations are depicted in Figure 4. Vegetation for both the
segment and the well pads include mixed bottom land with pine and hardwood trees and a
moderate to dense understory in the lower elevations and predominantly planted pine forest on
the higher elevations of the southern one-quarter of the segment. From north to south, soils in
the area include Alazan-Besner Complex in the Neches River floodplain, Multey-Moten
17

complex in an unnamed drainage along the base of a ridge, and patches of Attoyac fine sandy
loam, Herty very fine sandy loam, and Rosenwall fine sandy loam on the slopes and crest of the
ridge.

The Alazan-Besner Complex consists of Alazan soil roughly 45 cm (19 inches) of very

fine sandy loam over sandy clay cut by clayey Besner soils in several un-channeled drainages.
Multey-Moten complex consists of fine sandy loam and silt loam mounded to 45 cm (15 inches)
thick over clay loam. Attoyac fine sandy loam 30 cm (12 inches) deep over clay was found on
the slopes of the ridge while Herty very fine sandy loam 5 cm (3 inches) deep and Rosenwall
fine sandy loam 15 cm (6 inches) deep over clay was found on the crest of the ridge.
Shovel tests strategies changed with soil conditions. In the Alazan-Besner Complex and
Multey-Moten complex floodplain soils shovel testing focused on the mounded sandy soils and
avoided the clayey areas along drainages. In the Attoyac soils tests focused on areas within 100
m (330 ft) of surface water along the tow slope of the ridge. Herty and Rosenwall soils were
tested at low probability intervals because of the shallow nature of the soils and the intense
foresting activities on the uplands. Shovel test locations are depicted in Figure 4 and data is
presented in Table 3.

One archaeological site, 41AG189 was documented along Segment 3.
description is included in the Site Description Section.

The site

No cultural material was found in the

well locations. DETAC requests concurrence with a determination of “no effect” to NRHP
eligible cultural resources and no further work is recommended as shovel testing adequately
explored the width and depth of the proposed impacts. Site 41AG189 has a low potential for
containing intact features because of the deep disturbance by root activity and frequent
inundation with water in the sandy soils.
Segment 4 and Well 3
Segment 4 includes a new powerline and pipeline easement 670 m (2195 ft) along an
existing unimproved dirt road and Well 3 (Figure 4). The easement will be a 9 m (30 ft) wide
right-of-way which include the powerline and pipeline (Figure 2a). It will connect to the
proposed pipeline right-of-way in Segment 3 (Figure 4). Well 3 is a 46 m2 (150 ft2) location at
the northern end of Segment 4. Existing modern impacts to the area are limited to the clearing
of an unimproved dirt road. Soils along the segment were described as Pophers silty clay loam
for the majority of the segment and Osias silty clay at the Well 3 location. Observed soils were
different including 20 to 50 cm (8 to 20 inches) of light brown fine sandy loam over gray silty
clay. Vegetation for both the segment and the well pad include mixed bottom land with pine and
hardwood trees and a moderate to dense understory. A high water table dominates the area with
20

the southern portion of the segment flooded at the time of the survey. Nine shovel tests were
excavated on the well location and northern two-thirds of the segment because of the flooding.
Shovel test locations are depicted in Figure 4 and data is presented in Table 4.

No cultural material was found in the surface inspection or shovel testing efforts. Shovel
testing adequately explored the width and depth of the proposed impacts. DETAC requests
concurrence with a determination of “no effect” to NRHP eligible cultural resources because of
the lack of artifacts in the shovel testing effort. No further work is recommended.
Segment 5
Segment 5 is a new 12 inch pipeline right-of-way along an existing railroad and gas
pipeline right-of-way. The segment then follows a county road to the Chlorination Facility
(Figure 6). The segment extends from an upland ridge southward across Long Slough and onto
uplands near the City of Diboll. This segment will extend roughly 7.5 km (4.7 miles) along the
railroad and 366 m (1200 ft) along the county road to the Chlorination Facility. The easement
will be a 9 m (30 ft) wide right-of-way which include the powerline and pipeline (Figure 2b)
along the railroad right-of-way but will follow the edge of the improved county road between the
railroad and the chlorination facility.

Vegetation for the segment varies from bottomland

hardwood forest with mesic understory to upland pine forest with xeric understory. From north
to south, soils in the area include Fuller fine sandy loam on the ridge north of Long Slough,
Osias silty clay in the Long slough floodplain, Keltys fine sandy loam on the slope south of Long

Slough, and combinations of Multey-Moten complex and Fuller fine sandy loam on the uplands
along the southern portion of the segment. Fuller fine sandy loam consists of grayish brown fine
sandy loam over clay. Osias silty clay is frequently flooded silt clay over clay matrix. Keltys
fine sandy loam consists of roughly 65 cm (26 inches) of fine sandy loam over clay. MulteyMoten complex consists of fine sandy loam and silt loam mounded to 45 cm (15 inches) thick
over clay loam.
Probability areas along Segment 5 are highest on the tow slopes and sandy uplands
adjacent to Long Slough. Second highest probability areas include the several small unnamed
drainages dissecting the uplands south of Long Slough. The lowest probability areas include
Long Slough, because of the frequently flooded clayey soils, and the wide uplands south of the
slough, because of the greater distance to reliable surface water. Most of the Long Slough
floodplain was flooded at the time of the survey limiting shovel tests to the adjacent slopes.
Shovel test results are summarized in Table 5.

Table 5. Segment 5 Shovel Test Data.
Two archaeological sites, 41AG187 and 41AG188 were documented along Segment 5.
41AG188 was recorded on the northern ridge overlooking Long Slough and site 41AG187 was
recorded adjacent to an intermittent drainage on the uplands south of the slough.

Site

descriptions are included in the Site Description Section. Shovel testing adequately explored the
width and depth of the proposed impacts. DETAC requests concurrence with a determination of
“no effect” to NRHP eligible cultural resources and no further work is recommended. Both sites
have a low potential for containing intact features because of the loose sandy soils and deep
disturbance by root activity.
Chlorination Plant
The chlorination plant is a 0.8 ha. (2 ac.) area roughly 91 m2 (300 ft2) at the southwest
corner of the intersection of a powerline right-of-way and an improved dirt road (Figure 7).
Topographically, the plant is on the crest of a wide ridge with an intermittent stream channel
roughly 230 m (750 ft) to the north. Modern debris and refuse were observed along the eastern
edge of the area from recent dumping along the powerline right-of-way. Vegetation is planted
pine trees roughly 20 years old and a moderate understory of various bushes and shrubs. Soils
are Rosenwall fine sandy loam with roughly 15 cm of fine sandy loam over clay. The facility is
considered a low probably it area because of the distance to an unreliable water source, heavy
modern disturbance, and shallow soils. A total of five shovel tests were excavated in the plant
area. Shovel test results are described in Table 6.

Shovel Tests

Given the shallow nature of the soils, low probability of encountering cultural resources
and the excavation of five negative shovel tests, DETAC requests concurrence with a
determination of “no effect” to properties potentially eligible to the NRHP for the Chlorination
Facility.
Segment 6
Segment 6 consists of a 12 inch pipeline that extends 2.65 km (1.6 miles) from the
chlorination plant to a junction with the existing city water pipeline (Figure 7). This segment
follows an existing powerline right-of-way northward from the Chlorination Plant across an
intermittent drainage then turns eastward along a pipeline right-of-way until it enters a
residential neighbor hood. In the neighborhood it follows streets to the connection point. The
segment is entirely in upland ridges with mixed oak and pine forests; however, since the segment
will follow existing right-of-ways for the entire length, the vegetation is dominated by pasture
grasses and low bushes and shrubs. Soils along the segment include Rosenwall fine sandy loam
with roughly 15 cm of fine sandy loam over clay near the chlorination plant, Fuller fine sandy
loam with roughly 40 cm of fine sandy loam over clay along the stream drainage and adjacent
slopes, and Bernaldo fine sandy loam with roughly 30 cm of fine sandy loam over clay along the
streets. The probability of encountering cultural resources varies from moderate to high along
the slopes overlooking the intermittent drainage to low further from water.
A total of 29 shovel tests were excavated between the plant and street boundary. Streets
all had well excavated ditches, driveways, and leveled yards along with buried utility cables
nearby.

Data from each test is described in Table 7 below with Shovel Test 1 near the

chlorination plant and Shovel Test 29 near the urban development:

Table 7. Segment 6 Shovel Test Data
Modern disturbances dominate the segment. Shovel testing revealed soil depths vary
from shallow further from the stream to deeper near the channel. Testing at both high and low
probability intervals failed to document any cultural resources.

Shovel testing adequately

explored the width and depth of the proposed impacts. DETAC requests concurrence with a
determination of “no effect” to properties potentially eligible to the NRHP for Segment 6.
Site Descriptions
41AG187
Site 41AG187 is prehistoric lithic scatter adjacent to an intermittent drainage near the
eastern margin of the Neches River floodplain (Appendix A). The site consists of six lithic
artifacts recovered from two of eight shovel tests in a 30 m (100 ft) area. Soil consists of Fuller
fine sandy loam (NRCS 2005) roughly 80 cm (32 inches) deep (Figure 8 incert). Vegetation is
upland forest with mixed pines, a variety of hardwoods, various shrubs and vines. Ground
surface visibility is limited to 10-15% by a dense covering of pine duff and leaves. Potential
modern historic impacts were limited to the clearing of a right-of-way for both the railroad and a
gas pipeline, although shovel tests along the pipeline were negative.
Eight shovel tests were excavated in the immediate area. All eight shovel tests were
excavated to a gradual accumulation of clay roughly 80 cmbs. Based on the soil description, this

transition marks the beginning of a sandy clay loam Bt horizon. Six tests were excavated north
of the drainage channel and two were excavated south of the channel. Only two shovel test (1
and 4) were positive.
Artifacts include five chunks (four were chert and one was petrified wood) and one chert
secondary flake. Three of the chert chunks were recovered from Shovel Test 1 in Level 2 while
the remaining two chunks and the flake were recovered in Levels 2 and 3 in Shovel Test 4.
The paucity of artifacts suggests site 41AG187 was a short-term occupation that may have
consisted of an individual testing gravels retrieved from the drainage channel. Alternatively,
channel migration may have destroyed the bulk of the site leaving the sparse remains. The
friable soils suggest there is a low chance of encountering intact features on the site. DETAC
request concurrence with a determination of “no effect” to sites eligible for NRHP status. No
further work is recommended for 41AG187.
41AG188
Site 41AG188 is prehistoric lithic scatter on a low sandy rise adjacent to a tributary to
Long Slough at the eastern margin of the Neches River floodplain (Appendix A). The site
consists of 12 lithic artifacts recovered from four of nine shovel tests in a 40 x 15 m (130 x 50 ft)
area (Figure 9). Soil are described as Koury loam roughly 60 cm (24 inches) deep according to
the soil survey (NRCS 2005); however, shovel testing found between 50 and 90 cm (20 and 36
inches) of light brown sandy loam soil over dark gray silt and clay. Vegetation is low-land forest
with a variety of hardwoods, various shrubs and vines. Ground surface visibility is limited to less
than 10% by a dense covering of deadfall. Potential modern historic impacts were limited to the
clearing of a right-of-way for both the railroad and a gas pipeline. The landform did not
continue on the east site of the railroad right-of-way suggesting the entire site was west of the
modern impacts.
Ten shovel tests were excavated in the immediate area. All ten shovel tests were
excavated to the gray silt and clay. Eight tests were excavated on the low rise and two were
excavated north of the rise on the tow slope of an adjacent ridge. Shovel Tests 1 thru 4 were
positive.

contain three petrified wood flakes in Level 5, Shovel Test 2 contain one petrified wood flake in
Level 4 and one petrified wood flake in Level 5, Shovel test 3 contain two petrified wood flakes
in Level 2, and Shovel Test 4 contain two chert flakes in Level 3 and three petrified wood flakes
in Level 6. Based on this information the majority of the artifacts were recovered from Levels 5
and 6 with a secondary concentration in Levels 2 and 3. Horizontally, the deepest concentration
of artifacts are between Shovel Tests 1 and 2 with shallower deposits in Shovel Test 3 and a
bimodal distribution of artifacts in Shovel Test 4.
The paucity of artifacts and variation in levels suggests site 41AG188 was one or two
short-term occupations. Site size and lack of substantial artifact distribution suggest there is a
low chance of encountering intact features on the site. DETAC request concurrence with a
determination of “no effect” to sites eligible for NRHP status. No further work is recommended
for 41AG188.
41AG189
41AG189 is a prehistoric site lithic scatter situated on a sandy rise north of an
intermittent drainage at the eastern margin of the Neches River floodplain (Appendix A). The
site consists of 7 lithic artifacts recovered from two of eleven shovel tests in a 40 x 30 m (130 x
100 ft) area (Figure 10). Soil on the NRCS map show the area to be Fuller fine sandy loam
(NRCS 2004); however, the environment of the area is more similar to the adjacent AlazanBesner Complex. Shovel testing found roughly 80 cm (32 inches) deep loamy sand (Figure 10
incert). Vegetation is low-land forest with a variety of hardwoods, various shrubs and vines.
Ground surface visibility is limited to less than 10% by a dense covering of deadfall. Potential
modern historic impacts were limited to the clearing of a right-of-way for the improved gravel
road and an abandoned logging road. Both modern disturbances may have impacted the site;
however, the artifact distribution does not clearly show the extent of either disturbance.
Eleven shovel tests were excavated in the vicinity to determine the site boundaries.
Shovel test texture and depth ranged from 80 cm of sandy loam over a weak Bt horizon to clayey
deposits on the surface. Two of the shovel tests were culturally positive yielding five petrified

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The Eason Lake Well Field project consists of 16.1 kilometers (km) (10 miles) of
collection pipelines, five water well locations, a Chlorination Facility, and powerlines to the well
locations. All pipe trenches will be excavated to between 75 and 90 centimeters (cm) (30 and 36
inches). Visual examination and shovel tests were employed at required intervals in designated
low and high probability areas.
Segment 1 includes a powerline easement across an area frequently inundated with water;
no cultural resources were documented and shovel testing found generally shallow, clayey soils.
Segment 2 includes a powerline, pipeline, and Well 4 in the Neches River floodplain; no
cultural resources were documented and shovel testing found sandy loamy soils with evidence of
occasional inundation. Segment 3 includes a powerline, pipeline, with Wells 1, 2, and 3
Alternate along an improved gravel road in the Neches River floodplain; one archaeological site
(41AG189) was documented on a low sandy rise adjacent to a stream channel. Segment 4
includes a powerline, pipeline, and Well 3 in the Neches River floodplain; no cultural resources
were documented and shovel testing found sandy loamy soils frequent water inundation is
evident in the southern portion of the segment. Segment 5 follows existing railroad and gas
pipeline easements between the Neches River floodplain and the uplands near Diboll; the area in
the floodplain was flooded at the time of the survey; however, shovel testing on the adjacent
uplands documented two archaeological sites (41AG187 and 41AG188) in deep sandy loam
soils. Site 41AG187 was a lithic artifact scatter adjacent to an intermittent upland drainage. Site
41AG188 was a lithic artifact scatter adjacent to the Long Slough/Neches River floodplain.
Segment 6includes a pipeline that extends from the Chlorination Facility to a connection point
with the existing water system; shovel testing revealed soil depths vary from shallow further
from the stream to deeper near the channel. The Chlorination Facility encompasses a 0.8 hectare
(2 acre) area on an upland ridge in the city of Diboll; soils were shallow fine sandy loam.

35

The three new archaeological sites were identified during the survey were lithic artifact
scatters on sandy landforms adjacent to surface water sources. No cultural features were observed
in shovel tests. None of the sites yielded artifacts diagnostic of a particular cultural phase. The
potential for encountering cultural features on any of the sites was determined to be low because of
the deep, loose, nature of the sandy soils and abundant root disturbances observed on all three sites.
DETAC requests a determination of “no effect” for the proposed development of the
Eason Lake Well Field. Shovel testing adequately explored the width and depth of the proposed
impacts.

Any expansion of the proposed development should be investigated for cultural

resources. The area still retains a general high probability for containing cultural resources.
