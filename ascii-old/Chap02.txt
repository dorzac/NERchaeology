Chapter 2: The Guadalupe-San Antonio River Basins at the End of the
Younger Dryas
INTRODUCTION
The first chapter reviewed the nature of global environmental change at the
transition from the Pleistocene to the Holocene, and sketched the contemporary
appearance of the study area. This chapter will narrow the focus in both time and space,
looking at paleoenvironmental data from the end of the Younger Dryas (Fig. 2.0), and
reviewing other sites in the Guadalupe and San Antonio River basins that have furnished
proxy data. First, however, we must address some radiocarbon assay problems.

In my quest to find out what was happening to regional environments at that time,
I have had to slog through an expansive and often murky cienega of literature, and now I
find I must drag the reader behind me. Trying to review the various contradictions,
omissions, and inconsistencies of the empirical record makes for tedious reading indeed
in this chapter, but the reader must follow the same trail in order to understand just what
the limitations are.
CHRONOMETRIC CONVENTIONS
Kinds of years
Much of Chapter 1 discussed polar ice cores. The upper parts of these cores can
be dated by counting summer layers (Dawson 1992:19), much like tree rings, at least as
far back as 8000 years ago. Counts back to 8000 BP are made by looking for seasonal
isotope peaks; detection of seasonal peaks in acid and dust content can further extend the
216

annual counts somewhat beyond the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary. Below that point,
compression and distortion from the weight of accumulated ice has smeared the layers,
and dating must rely on calculations of accumulation rate using ice-flow models.

In any case, ice-core years are roughly equivalent to calendar years. Actually,
Jerrard and McNeill (1992:188-190) define several different kinds of years (tropical,
sidereal, astronomical, Gaussian, mean solar, calendar year), but the differences are
trivial at an archeological scale. I will use the terms calendar year or sidereal year
interchangeably to refer to years marked by passage of the earth around the sun. For
practical purposes, years of this kind can be considered equivalent to calibrated
radiocarbon years, and I will use the term "cal BP" to refer to calendar years before
present, where "present" is defined by convention as the radiocarbon zero point of AD
1950. The reader may think of "cal" as an abbreviation for either "calendar" or
"calibrated". The term "uncal BP" refers to uncalibrated radiocarbon years before
present, and the abbreviation RCYBP refers to "radiocarbon years before present." The
GISP ice core record extends up to the year 1989, but the zero point is set at AD 1950, so
as to synchronize it with the radiocarbon zero point (1989 is considered "minus 39 years
BP" in the ice core chronology).

Because students of the paleoenvironment deal in so many different kinds of years
(ice-core years, varve years, uncalibrated and calibrated radiocarbon years), researchers
are obligated to state explicitly what kinds of years they are using, and where the zero
point is fixed. Unfortunately, few honor this obligation. Even today, much of the
literature in leading journals such as Nature or Science is opaque where such details are
concerned. Comparing timescales measured in different kinds of years can lead to serious
error.

Because the Greenland ice cores furnish what is clearly the best and most detailed
proxy record for the transition to the Holocene, it is inevitable that the ice core record
218

should be proposed as the stratigraphic yardstick for this period. Bjorck and others (1998)
have proposed a climatic event stratigraphy for the North Atlantic region based on the
GRIP ice core, with the Holocene beginning at 11,500 ice core years BP (roughly 10,090
RCYBP).

The sidereal (or calendar year) timescale is obviously the best and most
parsimonious timescale, but because so much of the existing paleoenvironmental
literature is scaled in terms of radiocarbon years, I have adopted the uncalibrated
radiocarbon timescale as a standard for this study. The calibrated radiocarbon timescale
cannot be used because there is no such thing as a "final" calibration; calibration systems
are being improved constantly. In the present work, if kinds of years are not specified,
then uncalibrated radiocarbon years are implied.
The radiocarbon timescale
Unfortunately, the uncalibrated radiocarbon timescale is a distorted one. We know
these distortions of the radiocarbon timescale are present because in cases where AMS
dating of individual tree rings or macrofossils from lake varves has been compared with
dates independently derived by ring-counting or varve-counting, there are segments
where the paired age estimates are offset (Goslar et al. 1995; Hadjas, Ivy-Ochs, and
Bonani 1995:Table 1). What accounts for these deviations?

Two key assumptions on which Libby based the radiocarbon method are that 1)
the rate of radiocarbon production in the atmosphere has been constant throughout the
past and 2) the rate of exchange between the biosphere (including the oceans) and the
atmosphere has been rapid and constant. We now know that neither of these assumptions
219

is entirely true. Atmospheric radiocarbon content, or delta 14C, which Stuiver and others
define as "the relative deviation of the measured

14

C activity, after correction for (1)

radioactive decay related to age and (2) isotope fractionation, from the..." [oxalic acid
standard] (Stuiver et al. 1991:2) has been relatively low during warm periods and higher
at the onset of cold periods during the late Quaternary (van Geel, van der Plicht, and
Renssen 2003). It declines dramatically from the Late Glacial period through the
Holocene until the last millennium (Fig. 2.1; and Stuiver et al. 1991:Fig. 1). Various
measurements from corals and wood suggest that the radiocarbon declined from about
230 â° at about 13,500 RCYBP to about -15 â° at about the year AD 430 before rising
again to present values. According to Stuiver and others (1991), the decline is due chiefly
to changes in intensity of the earth's geomagnetic field, modulated at certain times (such
as the Younger Dryas) by changes in oceanic ventilation. At the Pleistocene-Holocene
boundary, this translates to an age offset of a millennium or more between calendric and
radiocarbon ages. Stuiver and Braziunas (1993) maintain that the high radiocarbon values
before 15,000 BP were due to lower geomagnetic dipole intensity, and that no major
changes in oceanic ventilation rates occurred after 12,500 BP (Stuiver and Braziunas
1993:146, 150).
The second of Libby's assumptions â constant exchange of carbon between the
oceans and atmosphere â is a particular problem, since the world's oceans contain more
than 90% of its

14

C inventory. Oceanic mixing or ventilation rates have varied at times

during the past. Periods of reduced upwelling can cut off the supply of "dead" carbon
(12C) from the deep ocean, making the radiocarbon content of the atmosphere appear
younger than it otherwise would. Since new
atmosphere, the

14

C continues to be produced in the upper

14

C/12C ratio in the atmosphere is temporarily enhanced beyond the

normal ratio, and any organic material that incorporates that radiocarbon will produce a
220

spuriously young radiocarbon age. Stocker and Wright (1996:789) estimate the increase
in atmospheric

14

C is on the order of 35 â° whenever the North Atlantic branch of the

"conveyor" is interrupted. Further complicating the picture, a significant fraction of the
world's terrestrial carbon inventory was transferred to the ocean when rising Holocene
sea level covered previously exposed continental shelves (Faure et al. 1996). This will
also have to be incorporated in future models.

mil units, from 10,000 cal BP (about 9050 RCYBP uncal) to the present,
adapted from Stuiver et al. (1991:Fig. 1). Long-term decline is driven by
geomagnetic field intensity.
221

Radiocarbon samples from marine sources are also affected. Although common
practice now is to include an invariant "marine reservoir effect" of about 400 years to
allow for the greater proportion of dead carbon in the oceans, the reservoir effect has
varied in the past according to the history of thermohaline circulation. Kroon and others
(1997:758), for example, estimate a reservoir effect of about 700 years during the
Younger Dryas. Although it is clear that the

14

C/12C ratio has varied during the

Quaternary, there are major differences of opinion on the relative importance of
geomagnetic field changes and changes in ocean ventilation rates. Stuiver and Braziunas
see geomagnetic field changes as the principal variable, with changes in ocean circulation
playing a minor role, at least during the Holocene. Stocker and Wright see ocean
circulation playing a major role in creating radiocarbon age plateaux (see also Goslar et
al. 2000, Hughen et al. 2000, and Muscheler et al. 2000). Others see changes in solar
activity and cosmic ray intensity as the principal cause (van Geel, van der Plicht, and
Renssen 2003) â that is, short-term fluctuations unrelated to the longer-term insolation
trends discussed in Chapter 1.
Atmospheric

radiocarbon

content

was

especially variable during the

Pleistocene-Holocene transition. Based on paired radiocarbon and uranium/thorium
assays of corals from the Huon Peninsula in Papua New Guinea, Edwards and others
estimate that atmospheric Î´

14

C actually dropped somewhat at the beginning of the

Younger Dryas, then rose slightly, then dropped sharply during the latter half of the
Younger Dryas (Fig. 2.2, B, adapted from Edwards et al. 1993:Fig. 5). Goslar and others
(1995) have compiled a similar curve using varve counts and AMS dated plant
macrofossils from sediments in Lake Gosciaz in Poland. Their curve begins at about
11,000 RCYBP and shows Î´

14

C rising abruptly at the onset of the Younger Dryas to a

peak, then declining thereafter (Fig. 2.2, A, adapted from Goslar et al. 1995:Fig. 4). See
222

also Goslar and others (2000:Fig. 3). Varve counts and radiocarbon dated foraminifera in
a marine core from the Cariaco Basin (offshore Venezuela) show the same thing (Hughen
et al. 2000:Fig. 3), as do radiocarbon-dated macrofossils from Kodiak Island, Alaska
(Hadjas et al. 1998). Confirmation of these curves also comes from AMS-dated
macrofossils in varved sediments of Lake Suigetsu, Japan (Kitagawa and van der
Plicht 1998).

223

224

The raw radiocarbon timescale is a compressed and distorted one, like a long
ribbon with small sections that are folded back upon themselves. Changes in ocean
ventilation rates can produce a plateau (a period during which calendar years march
onward, but the radiocarbon clock appears to stand still) or even small-scale inversions in
the radiocarbon age. Calibration is the procedure that pulls on the ends of the ribbon to
stretch it out to its true calendric length. Any archeologist who has used calibration
programs like CALIB or OXCAL has probably noticed that there are time spans during
which the calibration procedure will produce multiple solutions, or in some cases the
calibrated age will become slightly younger as the raw radiocarbon is increased. These
are periods when either production or ventilation rates are in flux. Since mode-switching
of thermohaline circulation appears to influence both climatic changes and the pace of the
radiocarbon clock, ambiguity of radiocarbon dates may occur exactly at those points
where close-interval dating is needed to clarify rapidly changing paleoclimate systems.

Apart from the problems of radiocarbon plateaux, another example of the
precision limits of radiocarbon dating is Michiganâs Gribben Forest, an entire spruce
forest buried in sand deposited by glacial outwash after the retreat of the Marquette ReAdvance in the early Holocene. The outer rings of four different spruce trees were AMS
dated at, respectively, 9660Â±60, 9830Â±70, 9930Â±70, and 10,290Â±90 RCYBP (11,155 to
12,103 cal BP; Pregitzer et al. 2000:Table 1). Burial was presumably a simultaneous
event, but in this case, the means of the raw assays differ by up to 630 years, and the
10,000 BP radiocarbon plateau introduces even further ambiguity.

225

Known radiocarbon plateaux
The present study of the bench deposits at Berger Bluff concerns chiefly the
period of 8500-11,000 uncalibrated radiocarbon years before present (uncal RCYBP).
There are known radiocarbon plateaux centered at about 12,700, 10,400, 10,000, and
9600 to about 9500 uncal RCYBP (Wohlfarth 1996:280, Fig. 1; see also Kromer and
Becker 1992:Fig. 3b, Kitagawa and van der Plicht 1998:1188). These show up clearly,
for example, in the radiocarbon-dated varve sequence at Rotsee, Switzerland (Lotter,
Ammann, and Sturm 1992:Fig. 2). As the chapter on radiocarbon dating will show, only
one of the assays from the bench area falls in the 10,000 RCYBP plateau.
THE YOUNGER DRYAS: GLACIAL REPRISE
After the height of the Wisconsinan glaciation at 18,000 RCYBP uncal, there was
rapid warming in many parts of the world from 13,000-11,000 RCYBP uncal (known in
the deglacial chronology as Termination 1a), then an abrupt cool episode known as the
Younger Dryas at about 11,000-10,000 RCYBP uncal, then resumed rapid warming
(Termination 1b), the Holocene, after 10,000 RCYBP uncal [Kennett 1990, Mathewes et
al. 1993; Reasoner et al. 1994; note that Broecker (1992), Hammer and Clausen (1986),
and Mix (1987: Fig. 16) give slightly different figures]. Figure 2.0 shows how this event
appears in marine and ice cores. Terminations 1a and 1b are marked by meltwater pulses
entering the world's oceans, while the Younger Dryas is marked by a halt (or in some
cases even a readvance) in the retreat of glaciers. The Younger Dryas (also known in the
ice core chronology as Greenland Stadial 1, or GS-1) has always intrigued
paleoclimatologists because it is too short, begins too rapidly, and ends too rapidly to be a
result of astronomical forcing. Alley (2000) reviews its appearance in the Greenland ice
cores.
226

The Younger Dryas is foreshadowed in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Maine
by a 250-year-long "precursor" cooling event known as the Killarney

Oscillation,

presumably associated with the Gerzensee Oscillation in Switzerland. It has also been
detected at Crawford Lake, near Ontario, shortly before 11,000 RCYBP (Yu and Eicher
1998). The Killarney Oscillation lasts from 11,160 to 10,910 RCYBP (Levesque et al.
1993; Cwynar and Levesque 1995). In the Canadian sites, it is separated from the
Younger Dryas by a very short warmer period, but at its end nearly coincides with the
beginning of the Younger Dryas as it is dated elsewhere (see below). The Killarney
Oscillation has not been widely recognized elsewhere, most likely because other students
have not used the 0.5-1.0 cm sampling resolution employed by the Canadian researchers.
They estimate a drop in summer water surface temperature of about 4Â° C during the
Killarney Oscillation and about 7Â° C during the Younger Dryas (Levesque et al.
1993:Fig. 3). Fossil beetle data from Nova Scotia and New Brunswick suggest July
temperatures about 0.5Â° C above to 5.3Â° C below modern, and January temperatures
about 7-17.9Â° C below modern in the early Younger Dryas (10,600-11,100 RCYBP;
Miller and Elias 2000:Table 2). Chironomid data from Splan Pond suggest a 2.5-4.5Â° C
drop in July temperatures at the onset of the Younger Dryas, and an abrupt rise of 6.06.5Â° C at its end (Lotter et al. 1999). The Killarney Oscillation ends at about the same
time as Vance Haynes's "Clovis drought," although the relationship between the two is
unknown.

Dating the Younger Dryas
The Younger Dryas climatic signal has been recognized in the Greenland ice
cores, in lake varves, in marine sediments, and various other kinds of sites. Age estimates
227

for the beginning and end, however, vary according to local dating problems. As a result,
there is still some lingering uncertainty as to whether this event is synchronous
worldwide, or whether discrepancies in age estimates are merely due to local dating
problems. For example, Goslar et al. (1995) estimated the end of the Younger Dryas at
11,440Â±120 cal BP, which is about 220 years later than the estimate from the GISP2 ice
core. However, their estimate comes from varved sediments in Lake Gosiacz in Poland,
and because the upper part of the core is poorly laminated, the chronology is considered
"floating" at the upper end. Hajdas and others (1995:77) place the YD/Pre-Boreal
transition at about 11,000 calendar years BP, and the length of the YD at about 1140
years, based on varve-counting at Soppensee, Switzerland. Other estimates from
European records seem to lag as much as 800-900 years behind the Greenland ice core
signal (Stromberg 1994; Bondevik and Mangerud 2002). Likewise, the Younger Dryas
shows up in cores from Owens Lake, California, but a 500-year error factor in age
estimates makes it impossible to demonstrate synchroneity (Benson et al. 1997. As Lowe
and others (1995) point out, some of the dating difficulty derives from the fact that the
onset of the period is time-transgressive, for example affecting England somewhat earlier
than northwestern Germany (see also Ruddiman and McIntyre 1981:Fig. 26).
Most of the earlier estimates put the beginning of the Younger Dryas at about
12,700 calendar years BP and its end at 11,500 calendar years BP (Johnsen et al.
1992:Table 1; Alley et al. 1993:Table 2; Goslar et al. 1995; BjÃ¶rck et al. 1998). BjÃ¶rck et
al. (1996) put the end at 11,450 to 11,390Â±80 calendar years BP. For a recent
comprehensive list of estimates of the beginning and end of the Younger Dryas, see
tables 2 and 1, respectively, in Goslar, Arnold, and Pazdur (1995).

228

The most recent, and probably most accurate estimate of the end of the Younger
Dryas comes from the GISP2 core, where the YD/Preboreal transition appears to start at
11,645 calendar years BP (Taylor et al. 1997:826). The most recent estimate of the start
of the Younger Dryas appears to be 12,820Â±260 calendar years BP (Goslar, Arnold, and
Pazdur 1995:Table 2), although the beginning is not as well defined as the termination.
The best estimate of YD duration appears to be about 1300Â±70 calendar years (Alley et
al. 1993).

These estimates correspond roughly to an inception date of 10,897 radiocarbon
years BP uncal and a termination of 10,091 RCYBP uncal, with a duration of roughly
800 uncalibrated radiocarbon years.
In terms of the chronology of the Berger Bluff bench deposits, this means that at
least part of the lowest sediments in the bench probably date to the Younger Dryas
(although it is difficult to be specific because the lower part of the section is poorly
dated), while the middle to upper parts of the bench stratigraphy probably encompass all
of the Preboreal and part of the Boreal periods.
The Younger Dryas should be of particular interest to archeologists because a
large part of the known, radiocarbon-dated Paleoindian archeology in North America
dates from this period of climatic change. It begins at about the same time as the earliest
dated Folsom components, but ends either somewhat before or after the latest Folsom
components, depending on whether one chooses to rely on the ice core evidence for
dating, or some other kind of record. The time relationship of Clovis components to the
Younger Dryas is more difficult to specify, simply because Clovis components are so
poorly assayed. Some of the younger Clovis
229

assays apparently overlap with the

beginning of the Younger Dryas as well (see Roosevelt 1998). Likewise, radiocarbon
dates from the Goshen component at the Mill Iron site straddle the beginning of the
Younger Dryas, although most of them are slightly earlier (Frison 1996:Table 1.1). The
association of these well-known Paleoindian complexes (Folsom certainly, Clovis,
Goshen, and Dalton possibly) with this dramatic episode of climate change certainly has
behavioral, if not deterministic implications.
Equally interesting is the fact that several Paleoindian occupations of equivalent
age are known from the northeastern US and Canadian maritime provinces, the area
where the Younger Dryas is best documented in the western hemisphere. This area
clearly was not abandoned during the Younger Dryas climatic reversal (Roberts 1984,
Keenlyside 1991). Although few Paleoindian sites in this region have radiocarbon assays,
the Debert (MacDonald 1968), Hiscock (Laub 1995), Whipple (Locus B, Curran
1984:13), Vail, and Shawnee-Minisink sites (Haynes et al. 1984:Table 2; Gramly
1982:60) fall within the Younger Dryas time span. The Michaud site may perhaps also
be included, although it has discrepant assays on Feature 7 (Speiss and Wilson 1987:8384). The Vermilion Lakes site in Alberta also has early archeological components (Group
1, 10,800 to 10,300 uncal BP) with evidence of mountain sheep hunting and a possible
windbreak or shelter. Although pollen is lacking from those components, it was
recovered from underlying sediments and from 20 km away at Copper Lake, and the
evidence suggests a Younger Dryas climatic signal to the excavators (Fedje et al.
1995:100-102).
Origin of the Younger Dryas
Wallace Broecker is perhaps the principal advocate of a thermohaline circulation
model for the origin of the Younger Dryas (Broecker et al. 1988; Broecker 1994, 1995,
230

1997; Wright 1989). According to this model, increasing insolation at high latitudes in
the Late Glacial period produced substantial meltwater, mostly from the Laurentide, but
also from the Fennoscandian ice sheet. Once the Laurentide sheet retreated sufficiently,
meltwater was routed eastward through the St. Lawrence seaway instead of the
Mississippi River. This produced an extensive cap of fresh water over the North Atlantic,
an area where previously very dense, saline water was produced.

This dense, saline water (North Atlantic Deep Water, or NADW) normally sinks
to the ocean depths, flowing southward, and is replaced by less saline surface water that
flows northward in the Gulf Stream, bearing considerable heat from the equatorial region.
It is this northerly-redistributed heat that maintains Europe's maritime climate. According
to Broecker, disruption of this "conveyor" system by meltwater in the Younger Dryas
was responsible for cold climate both over the North Atlantic itself and the bordering
regions of Europe and North America. Broecker proposed a sort of "mode-switching" in
which NADW production shut off during cold episodes (Broecker, Peteet, and Rind
1985). Some recent modeling studies (Fanning and Weaver 1997; Fawcett et al. 1997)
support the Broecker model.

Various challenges to this model have been issued. Jansen and Veum (1990),
for example, maintain that there was actually an increase in NADW production during
the Younger Dryas proper. Webb et al. (1997) use GCM modeling to suggest that glacialage ocean heat transport was similar to modern rates, but changed CO2 levels led to
enhanced cooling (presumably this applies to the Younger Dryas as well). Studies of
salinity history in three marine cores at the outlet of the Gulf of St. Lawrence show
meltwater pulses before and after the peak of the Younger Dryas (especially at 10,210
231

RCYBP), but indicate reduced melting during the peak; moreover, the freshening effect
of meltwater was confined to the uppermost water layer and vanished before reaching the
continental shelf break (De Vernal, Hillaire-Marcel, and Bilodeau 1996). This is
supported by analysis of marine cores across the North Atlantic by Duplessy, Labeyrie,
and Paterne (1996), who likewise find no evidence of meltwater presence during the
Younger Dryas. These findings seem particularly damaging to the Broecker model (see
also Moore et al. 2000). Other studies challenging the thermohaline model have focused
on the role of intermediate water (Boyle and Keigwin 1987; Rahmstorf 1994; Smith et al.
1997). Berger and Jansen (1995) dispute the NADW-production model and propose an
alternate model which they call the "super-fjord heat pump" and assert that
deglaciation is a phenomenon that has to do with the collapse of ice; thus, it is
largely a problem in glacial geology. The Younger Dryas, a pause in deglaciation,
also is a problem of glacial geology, therefore (Berger and Jansen 1995:93).
Renssen and others (2000) offer an even greater departure, suggesting that the Younger
Dryas was triggered by a reduction in solar irradiance.

Geographic extent
A consensus has long prevailed that the Younger Dryas was essentially a circumNorth Atlantic phenomenon. It was thought to be best expressed in the maritime regions
of western Europe and eastern Canada (Miller 1996, 1997), becoming less well defined
toward the continental interiors (Wright 1989:298; Yu and Wright 2001); cooling was
thought to be marked in Europe but minor in eastern North America (Wright 1989:300).
In 1992, Dorothy Peteet published a map showing the pollen record of the Younger
Dryas, present only in the northeast, and absent in the rest of the United States (Peteet
1992:Fig. 1). The most comprehensive geographic review of pollen-based Younger Dryas
232

climatic signals was published by Rind and others (1986). Their review also showed an
absence of evidence in the North American continental interior, including the three
palynological sites they list for Texas: Crane Lake, Bonfire Shelter, and Boriack Bog.
Their computer simulation of Younger Dryas climatic change yielded only very small
departures from present-day conditions for the central United States â a 0.8Â° C drop in
average annual temperature, an increase in precipitation of 0.1 mm per day, and an
increases of P-E (precipitation minus evaporation) of 0.2 mm per day (Rind et al.
1986:Table 9). A more recent and still more comprehensive review of modeling and
empirical evidence suggests about a 3Â° C reduction in mean annual air temperature from
the present (Rutter et al. 2000:Fig. 2) in Texas.
However, more recent studies have found evidence of Younger Dryas cooling in
various parts of the world far removed from the North Atlantic (Dawson 1992:104-105).
Reassessments of the North American evidence by Peteet in 1995 found a wider
"footprint" (Peteet 1995a, 1995b) than in her 1992 survey. Younger Dryas signals have
been found at Crawford Lake and Twiss Marl Pond near Toronto (Yu and Eicher 1998),
at Crowfoot Lake and Bow Lake in Alberta (Reasoner, Osborn, and Rutter 1994), at
Canandaigua Lake, New York (Wellner and Dwyer 1996), in Connecticut and New
Jersey (Peteet et al. 1993), at Owens Lake, California (Benson et al. 1997), in the Gulf of
California (Keigwin and Jones 1990), at Black Mountain Lake and Sky Pond in Colorado
(Menounos and Reasoner 1997; Reasoner and Jodry 2000), in reactivated moraines in
British Columbia (Friele and Clague 2002) and southern California (Owen et. al. 2003),
in marine cores off British Columbia (Mathewes, Heusser, and Patterson (1993) and in
the Sulu Sea (Kudrass et al. 1991), in pollen data from lake sediments at Glacier Bay,
Alaska (Engstrom, Hansen, and Wright 1990), in pollen data from a core at Jackson
Pond, Kentucky (Wilkins et al. 1991), possibly in moraines in Wyoming (Gosse et al.
233

1995), in a bog core and lake sediments from Costa Rica (Islebe, Hooghiemstra, and van
der Borg 1995; Orvis and Horn 2000), in pollen data from Colombia (van ât Veer Islebe,
and Hooghiemstra 2000), Tierra del Fuego (Heusser and Rabassa 1987), and Chile
(Moreno 1997), in moraines in Ecuador (Clapperton et al. 1997), in ice cap cores in
Bolivia (Thompson et al. 1998) and possibly in Peru (Thompson et al. 1995), in a New
Zealand moraine (Denton and Hendy 1994); in sediment deposition rates, geochemistry,
and pollen at Lake Van, in Turkey (Landmann et al. 1996); in pollen from cores at Lake
Albert, Uganda (Beuning, Talbot, and Kelts 1997) and a peat bog in Burundi (as an
aridity signal, Bonnefille et al. 1995); in 18O ratios of snail shell from South Africa (Abell
and Plug 2000), and in diatoms, pollen, magnetic minerals, and geochemistry of cores
from Lake Magadi in Kenya (Roberts et al. 1993). As evidence continues to accumulate,
it begins to look as though the Younger Dryas might be global in extent (Rutter et al.
2000).
Along with these records, there are others where the Younger Dryas is seemingly
absent (see, for example, Ashworth and Hoganson 1993; Thunell and Miao 1996; Singer,
Shulmeister, and McLea 1998). In some cases, this may be due just to inadequate dating
or a sampling resolution that is too coarse, but in others it may reflect a genuine absence
of climatic reversal. Elias (1994) finds little or no evidence for it in the North American
insect data. Linsley (1996) finds a Younger Dryas-age

18

O signal in marine cores from

the Sulu Sea, but interprets it as simply a record of global meltwater input, rather than
local sea surface temperature. We do not yet know enough about the geographic
distribution of the Younger Dryas climatic signal to discern whether its seemingly mosaic
pattern is genuine, or an artifact of inadequate sampling. In science, it is often the case
that the view is obscured until someone troubles to wipe the windowpane.
234

One of the most intriguing records comes from the Great Basin, where an
extensive series of radiocarbon-dated "black mats" provides a past record of spring
discharge and cienega formation. This interval begins at about 11,800 RCYBP and
extends well into the Holocene, but the major peak in spring activity clearly coincides
with the Younger Dryas (Quade et al. 1998:Fig. 5).
In any case, the far-flung Younger Dryas records that are known now should
indicate that this climatic episode is potentially recognizable anywhere in the world,
including Texas. If it has left an imprint in Costa Rica at 2310 meters, perhaps it also
could have left an imprint in Texas at 23 meters. Later in this chapter I will examine
paleoenvironmental records from the Guadalupe-San Antonio river basins, looking for
any evidence of a Younger Dryas climatic signal.
Preboreal and Boreal events
There are a few other minor climatic events following the Younger Dryas, about
which even less is known. In the western Great Lakes area, the Marquette ice advance
occurs at about 10,000 RCYBP or a little later (Pregitzer et al. 2000:46). Anderson,
Mullins, and Ito (1997) recognize a regional cold interval at Seneca Lake, New York,
which they believe dates to about 10,100-8200 RCYBP, although radiocarbon control is
sparse. Kaufman and others (1993) document an ice-stream advance at the mouth of the
Hudson Strait at 9900-9600 uncal BP. This seems to reflect mainly the instability of the
rapidly melting Laurentide ice sheet and apparently has only regional climatic
significance, but in northern Europe and Iceland at about the same time, a regional cold
episode known as the Preboreal Oscillation has been recognized in pollen and other
records, roughly dating 9800-9700 RCYBP uncal (BjÃ¶rck et al. 1997; Hammerlund et al.
1999:26; Mullins 1998), and attributed to drainage of glacial Lake Agassiz into the Arctic
235

(Fisher, Smith, and Andrews 2002, who date its inception at 9900 RCYBP and its
duration at 150-250 years). Possibly related is the Disko glacial readvance on Disko
Island, along the western coast of Greenland, at 9300 RCYBP uncal (Ingolfsson et al.
1990). Another 200-year cooling event has been detected in the Northern Hemisphere at
about 9100 RCYBP (10,300 cal BP; BjÃ¶rck et al. 2001). Slightly later at 8900-8400 uncal
BP is another Laurentide ice advance (Kerwin 1996; see also Hu et al. 1999), perhaps
coeval with the main Mattawa highstand of Lake Huron, at 8900-8100 uncal BP (Rea et
al. 1994). The best-known of these readvances is the Cochrane advance (8400-7800 BP),
which occurred throughout the Canadian Arctic, Hudson Bay, and the James Bay
Lowlands (Dawson 1992:100) and possibly even in Washington State (Thomas,
Easterbrook, and Clark 2000). Beget (1983) drew attention to various worldwide glacier
or icecap readvances radiocarbon dated between 8500-7500 uncal BP. A cold episode at
about 9000-8800 cal BP (roughly 8145-8020 uncal BP) has also been recognized in
western Europe (Magny 1995).

Even later is a cool episode ("Holocene Event 5," or more commonly just the
â8200 BP eventâ) that shows up at about 8200 cal BP (roughly 7457 RCYBP uncal) in
the GISP2 ice core (Alley et al. 1997; Johnsen et al. 2001) and at many other global
locations, such as Lake Ammersee, Germany (von Grafenstein et al. 1998,), Soppensee
and Schleinsee in Switzerland (Tinner and Lotter 2001), at 7440 RCYBP uncal in a
marine core from the North Sea and German oak tree rings (Klitgaard-Kristensen et al.
1998), in Irish speleothems (Baldini, McDermott, and Fairchild 2002), British land snails
(Rousseau, Preece, and Limondin-Lozouet 1998), in isotopes of archeological animal
bone from South Africa (Smith, Lee-Thorp, and Sealy 2002), possibly in ice cores from
Mount Kilimanjaro (Thompson et al. 2002), in various proxies from Taylor Lake, Nova
236

Scotia (Spooner, Douglas, and Terrusi 2002), Elk Lake, Minnesota (Dean, Forester, and
Bradbury 2002), and in the 18O record from Crawford Lake, near Ontario (Yu and Eicher
1998). This cold event is about half as intense as the Younger Dryas, but much shorterlived (possibly less than 40 years), and has been attributed to the final collapse of the
Hudson Bay remnant of the Laurentide Ice Sheet and glacial lake drainage through the
Hudson Strait, beginning about 8450 cal BP (Andrews et al. 1999; Barber et al. 1999;
Shuman et al. 2002; Clarke et al. 2003). It may be hemispheric or even global in extent,
but is probably too recent to appear anywhere in the bench deposits at Berger Bluff (for
comparison, the timing falls within the Circleville Phase of the Central Texas
archeological chronology). There is also, according to Stager and Mayewski (1997),
widespread evidence of climatic reorganization at roughly 7460-7015 uncal BP.
These are just a few examples of possible climatic events on a smaller scale at the
beginning of the Holocene. Many more examples could be found in the literature, but the
difficulties of defining these in time and space are even more pronounced than for the
Younger Dryas. Because of the insolation maximum, rapid melting of continental ice
sheets and alpine ice caps was the order of the day in the early Holocene, leading to ice
sheet instability and ice surging which is difficult to discriminate from episodes of
significant global climate change. There are many other kinds of events (for example,
isotope discontinuities in soils, discontinuities in pollen and faunal assemblages, and
depositional discontinuities in alluvial settings) that can be recognized in the North
American early Holocene, especially around 8500 uncal BP. Some of these will be
discussed elsewhere.

THE GULF OF MEXICO: SEA LEVEL, MELTWATER, AND TEMPERATURE HISTORY
Sea level during deglaciation
At its present level, the Gulf of Mexico lies about 49 km to the southeast of
Berger Bluff at the head of Mission Lake, or 82 km away at the Matagorda Island beach,
depending on how one chooses to measure it. At the peak of the Wisconsinan glaciation,
sea level in the Caribbean (and presumably in the Gulf as well) stood some 121 m below
its present level (Fairbanks 1989:639) and an additional 88 km to the southeast of the
present Matagorda Island shoreline (Berryhill 1981a, b).

There

are

three

reasons

why

Quaternary

sea

level

is

relevant

to

paleoenvironmental studies at Berger Bluff:
1) By Full Glacial time, Texas rivers had extended their channels Gulfward and far to the
south across the emergent continental shelf. This affected stream gradients, an effect
that gradually diminished as sea level rose again in the Late Glacial period. Whether
altered gradients had any effect on stream deposition is a question I will address later.

2) Some rivers that today are independent drainage systems heading farther to the west in
widely varying climatic regions of the state were, in the late Pleistocene and early
Holocene, linked together as parts of unified drainage systems. Fluvial behavior in one
part of the system may have influenced other parts.

238

3) The open Gulf, with its maritime climatic influence, was twice as far away then as it is
now, and this may have had minor effects on local climate, animal ranges, and human
behavior.
How much lower was the Gulf, then, and how much farther away? The most
important events (summarized in Fig. 2.0) are described by Richard Fairbanks this way:
Between 17,100 and 12,500 yr BP, the sea level increased by 20 m....This first
phase of deglaciation was terminated by an exceedingly rapid sea level rise of 24
m in less than 1,000 radiocarbon years, termed melt-water pulse IA (mwp-IA).
Melt-water pulse IA (12,000 yr BP) corresponds to the latter part of Termination
Ia (14,500-11,500 yr BP) as defined in deep-sea Î´ 18O records....Melt-water pulse
IA and Termination Ia overlap to some extent, but cannot be synonymous. The
rate of sea level rise was at a minimum at 11,000 yr BP, marking the beginning of
the Younger Dryas chronozone, and remained low until 10,500 yr BP. The last
half of the Younger Dryas chronozone (10,500-10,000 yr BP) is marked by
increasing rates of sea level change, culminating in melt-water pulse IB (mwp-IB)
centred at 9,500 yr BP. During mwp-IB, which closely corresponds to
Termination Ib in deep-sea terminology, the sea level rose ~28 m, similar to the
sea level rise associated with mwp-IA (Fairbanks 1989:639).
As sea level in the Gulf rose in estuarine areas, high-biomass marshes perhaps
were first created and then drowned by the rising water [although Saucier (1994a:248)
suggests saltwater invasion was too rapid to allow biologically productive ecosystems to
develop]. A detailed study by Nelson and Bray (1970) of the drowned Sabine River
valley did not suggest peat beds were very extensive. Cores drilled through the chenier
plain in southeast Texas, however, show the highest concentration of organic matter
immediately above the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary (Stewart, Martin, and Lagoe
1996:Fig. 4.
There are many worldwide radiometric data sets available for tracking deglacial
sea level rise. There are four that seem most relevant to the Gulf:
239

1) A composite set of radiocarbon assays on samples recovered from the Gulf
itself (Table 2.1). This set of assays (in uncalibrated radiocarbon years) is near the area of
concern, and is from a tectonically stable area. The upper Gulf coast has experienced
limited subsidence since the Late Glacial, but the central coast is quite stable.
Unfortunately, the available assays are on a heterogeneous collection of marine shell,
peat, undifferentiated "organics" or "plant" matter, driftwood, and sediment organics.
Many of these assays were run decades ago by various oil companies, with lab
procedures that do not adhere to modern radiocarbon lab standards. Shore, Bartley and
Harkness (1995) have found discrepancies of as much as 1210 years between the humin
and humic acid fractions of peat. In most cases, there is no clear documentation of how
deep below the water surface the biota are thought to have occurred; in fact, some
samples, such as peat, may have accumulated subaerially. There is also a deficit of
samples from the 10,000-12,000 RCYBP deglacial phase (Fig. 2.3). Pinter and Gardner
(1989) advocate curve-fitting as a method for estimating sea level rise. I have used a
curve-fitting program (Tablecurve), but the estimation procedure is simpler than that
advocated by Pinter and Gardner. A curve can be fitted to these assays, but there is a
wide spread of points about the line. Three anomalous assays and one with a very large
standard error were omitted from this data set.

These assays are all uncalibrated, and insofar as can be determined from the literature, no marine reservoir
correction is applied. Assays with very large standard errors are omitted.

Also problematical is the question of what kind of marine reservoir correction to
apply to these assays. Assays of Gulf seawater done in 1962 produced these ages (Hood
1963:Table IG):

3m

-83 yr

600 m

702 yr

1000 m

764 yr

3400 m

519 yr

These are presumably all contaminated with modern anthropogenic (nuclear
bomb testing) radiocarbon, so they are of little use in estimating a reservoir correction for
the Gulf.
The extensive meltwater in the Late Glacial Gulf was presumably radiocarbondepleted, but rapid drowning of organic-rich marsh and grassland habitats might well
have offset this effect. In addition, as we have already seen, marine reservoir ages in the
Atlantic and Pacific are known to have varied by several centuries at the beginning of this
period. Shells from estuarine areas of rivers draining the Texas Cretaceous may also have
a partial hard-water effect built into the age. Fitting a curve to the assays with no marine
reservoir correction (Fig. 2.3) gave an r2 value of 0.79 (standard error = 5.54), while
fitting a curve with a 400-year correction (not illustrated; applied to shell samples only)
242

actually increased the spread of points somewhat and gave an r2 value of 0.69 (standard
error = 6.67), suggesting that no reservoir correction may be appropriate for these
samples. If these assays had been calibrated, the marine reservoir correction would have
been selected as part of the calibration procedure (and the 5730-year halflife used, as
well), but instead, only the raw assays (and the Libby, or 5568-year halflife) are used.

Figure 2.3. Sea Level Estimated from Gulf of Mexico Radiocarbon Assays. Based on
assays in Table 2.1, with no marine reservoir correction and no calibration;
90% confidence intervals for curve fit are also shown.
243

Ricklis and Blum (1997:299) also recommend a +400-year correction for fractionation in
shell which, if applied, cancels out the -400-year marine reservoir correction in any case.
2) The second data set is a relatively small group of radiocarbon-dated samples of
corals (Acropora palmata, which usually grows in the upper five meters of the sea),
drilled from raised coral reefs in Barbados. This is a composite set of 15 assays that
combines some listed in Fairbanks (1989) with some from Bard and others (1990). The
data set has been corrected for tectonic uplift (34 cm per thousand years) and incorporates
an invariant 400-year marine reservoir correction. This data set (Fig. 2.4) has a much
tighter spread of points than the Gulf data, and it also shows much lower sea level at any
given point. The r2 value for the fitted curve is 0.98 (standard error = 2.81).

Figure 2.4. Sea Level Estimated from Barbados Corals. This is a composite of
radiocarbon-dated Acropora palmata samples; data from Fairbanks
(1989:Fig. 1) and Bard and others (1990:Table 1). No correction for growth
depth range.
244

3) A set of 29 radiocarbon-dated samples of corals (various genera) from raised
coral reefs at the Huon Peninsula in Papua New Guinea (Chappell and Polach 1991). This
reef has a faster uplift rate and heterogeneous composition, but the spread of points about
the fitted curve (Fig. 2.5) is quite tight, the r2 value is 0.98, and this solution has a smaller
standard error (2.29). It agrees well with the Barbados coral data, showing sea levels
perhaps a couple of meters higher at any given date. In terms of sample size and
consistency, this is clearly a better data set, even though it is removed halfway around the
world from our area of concern. In order to fit the curve shown in Fig. 2.5, I first
converted the depths given by Chappell and Polach (1991:Table 1) from depths below
coretop to depths below sea level using their uplift correction model:

depth below sea level = (8-coretop depth)-((.001*age)*1.9)

where 8 represents the present 8-meter crest of the reef and 1.9 represents the 1.9 meterper-millennium uplift rate; depths are in meters.

The polynomial curves fitted to the Gulf of Mexico and Huon Peninsula data sets
(Figs. 2.3, 2.5) take the form

depth in meters = a + b(age) + c(age)2 + d/(age) + e/(age)2

where a, b, c, d, and e are constants unique to each data set, and age is uncalibrated
radiocarbon years BP.
245

The polynomial curve fitted to the Barbados coral data is slightly different:

depth in meters = a + b/ln(age) + c/sqrt(age) +d/(age)

where a, b, c, and d are constants, ln is the natural logarithm (base e), sqrt is square root,
and age is uncalibrated radiocarbon years BP.

Figure 2.5. Sea Level Estimated from Papua New Guinea Corals. Samples are
radiocarbon-dated corals (Chappell and Polach 1991:Table 1) of various
genera, corrected for fractionation (and with 400-year marine reservoir
correction and uplift correction applied by K. Brown to published data), but
not calibrated. No correction for growth depth range.

246

4) A set of 34 radiocarbon-dated coral samples from Papeete, Tahiti (Bard et al.
1996; data downloaded from Nature Supplementary Data on the World Wide Web); I
used all except the most recent assay, but only the part of the curve before 7000 RCYBP
is shown in Fig. 2.6. The r2 value is for the entire curve from 5040 to 11,790 RCYBP.
The assays have been corrected for fractionation and for marine reservoir content of -40
â°. The fitted curve has an r2 value of 0.99 (standard error = 1.44). Tahiti is a tectonically
stable area, so no uplift correction is necessary, and the depths shown are below
contemporary sea level. This data set yields a sea level of -74.7 m at about 11,000
RCYBP and about -38.4 m at 8500 RCYBP. These levels are significantly lower than
those calculated from the other two data sets (Table 2.2), possibly because their uplift rate
models may be somewhat in error.

Polach (1991); Tahiti: Bard et al. (1996, data from web site). Dates are uncalibrated
radiocarbon years; uranium/thorium age assays were not used for these estimates.
All of these coral data sets have uranium-thorium age estimates as well, which
serve to confirm the radiocarbon assays, but I have not used the U/Th estimates, which
correspond to calendar years.

Information downloaded from the World Wide Web; assays more recent

correction required.
How episodic was sea level rise?
There are several lines of evidence suggesting that sea level has not simply risen
monotonically throughout the Late Glacial and Holocene, but has experienced
acceleration, stillstands, highstands, and regression, although probably not to the extent
suggested in the older literature. Many of the early published sea level reconstructions for
248

the Gulf, based on rather sparse data, proclaim rather dramatic fluctuations in sea level
(Morton and McGowen 1980:Fig. 60,c; Stright 1995:Fig. 7). In large part, this may be the
effect of a "connect the dots" model of sea level reconstruction, in which widely scattered
and disparate samples are joined to create "highstands" and "lowstands"(Fig.2.7, A).
Fitting a statistical curve to a cleaner data set like the Huon Peninsula corals, as in Fig.
2.5 or Fig. 2.7, B, gives hardly any indication of episodic sea level change. A recent
review of coastal archeological sites by Ricklis and Blum (1997) posits two periods of
rapid rise later in the Holocene, one after 7000 cal BP and another between 4000-5000
cal BP, based largely on the absence of terrestrial components in these periods.
While it might seem that the postglacial history of abrupt and episodic climate
change as presented in Chapter 1 would argue for strongly episodic sea level change,
there are impressive lag effects involved in melting of large ice sheets. I attribute most of
the variance seen in the Gulf of Mexico samples (Fig. 2.3) not to rapidly oscillating sea
level, but to dating errors (large standard errors and uncertainty about marine reservoir
ages) and provenience errors (for example, reworked shell, subsidence, turbidity flows, or
organic material that might have formed in place well above sea level rather than at sea
level).

While the first two coral data sets (Figs. 2.4, 2.5) are in good agreement, the
mixed Gulf of Mexico data set (Fig. 2.3) is in agreement only at about 8000 RCYBP;
before that, estimates run about 15 meters too high, compared to the Barbados and Huon
Peninsula coral data sets, and 25-28 m too high according to the Tahiti data set.

A highly critical review by Kidson (1982) of past efforts to compile a global
sea level curve concludes that "the acceptance of the concept of geoidal eustasy means
that eustasy as a world-wide phenomenon... can no longer be regarded as valid....The
search for a universal eustatic curve must be regarded as over" (Kidson 1982:131, 144).
What he means is that there are regional variations in sea level, to the extent that sea level
can actually be higher by several meters in one region than in some adjacent region.
Kidson points to variation in datum points, variation in definitions of sea level, varying
tidal ranges, errors in choice of dated samples, errors in measuring sample elevation, and
errors in dating as reasons for discrepancies between different regional sea level curves
â and the discrepancies are sizable (see Kidson 1982:Fig. 1).

Better evidence for episodic sea rise comes from detailed studies of coral reef
species composition in the Caribbean-Atlantic area by Blanchon and Shaw (1995), who
recognize three periods of accelerated sea level rise. Only two of those occur during the
period of concern here. One, designated CRE2, was a rapid 7.5 m rise at about 11,500 cal
BP (roughly 10,090 RCYBP), while CRE3 was a 6.5 m rise at about 7600 cal BP (about
6810 RCYBP). Note, however, that the CRE2 rise does not show in Fig. 2.4, and if it
corresponds to meltwater pulse IB as defined by Fairbanks (1989), the timing is
somewhat different. Evidence for CRE3 has been disputed by Toscano and Lundberg
(1998).

Some of the most intriguing evidence for episodic sea level rise can be found in
the form of submerged wave-cut notches off the coast of Oahu. The notches were cut
during stillstands, then preserved when accelerated rates of sea level rise left them well
underwater. Fletcher and Sherman (1995) have identified a series of features at depths of
251

47-67 m that they identify with the Younger Dryas reduction in rate of rise. Meltwater
pulses are indicated by sloping planation surfaces.
Effects of rising sea level on channel gradients
At present, the 23 m vertical drop from the 75 foot contour (where it crosses
Coleto Creek near Berger Bluff) to sea level in San Antonio Bay extends over an 83 km
distance, producing a channel gradient of about 27 centimeters per kilometer; Table 2.3
lists very rough estimates of changing channel gradients during the Late
Glacial/Holocene transgression for the combined Coleto Creek-Guadalupe River system.
Bathymetric contours for specified time intervals are based on the Huon Peninsula curve
shown in Figure 2.5. Actually, although I have anchored all but the first estimate at the 75
foot contour line upstream, at the downstream end the estimates are simply anchored at
sea level rather than the channel bottom. Some of these estimates would be much
improved if a detailed longitudinal profile could be incorporated, and the actual channel
base could be used as the downstream anchor point. Mapping by Wright (1980:Fig. 33)
of the Pleistocene Guadalupe River channel, now submerged under San Antonio Bay,
shows the channel is over 80 feet (24 m) below present sea level. Unfortunately,
comparably detailed mapping Gulfward is lacking. As a result, where I have used the 6 m
bathymetric contour off Matagorda Island as the base level estimate for 7000 BP, the
computed channel gradient is 0.2261 m/km, which is actually less than the present 0.2294
m/km gradient anchored at Grassy Point. In reality, the 6 m contour at 7000 BP would
have been found well up into the interior of San Antonio Bay, since Matagorda Island did
not exist yet. This illustrates the level of imprecision introduced where detailed channel
profiles are lacking. In San Antonio Bay itself, wood fragments buried in Guadalupe
River fluvial sediments at about 90 feet (27 m) below current sea level provided a
252

radiocarbon assay of 9800Â±350 uncal BP, run by Magnolia Petroleum in the 1950s
(Shepard 1956). This assay appears in Table 2.1 and on Fig. 2.3, but is about 23 m higher
than sea level estimated with the coral data sets, and may not be a good estimator of sea
level position.

NOTE: Measurements along submerged channel axes are based on mapping by Wright (1980:Fig. 33) and
Berryhill (1981a, b). Due to lack of knowledge of submerged channel depth, these are minimum estimates
of gradient. The actual gradients would have been somewhat steeper, especially for the more recent
periods.

253

Lack of detailed knowledge about the actual (meandering or straight) channel
pattern introduces further uncertainty. In Table 2.3, channel distances in the first column
are measured along the present meandering channel as far as the head of San Antonio
Bay, thence down the submerged channel axis, following mapping by Wright (1980) and
Berryhill (1981a, b). The reader should note that the map version published later by
Berryhill (1987:Fig. 2-2) indicates a different and much longer path to base level and
would probably reduce all of the premodern gradients in Table 2.3 considerably.
Distances in the third column are measured down the valley axis for the entire distance,
giving an estimate of the steeper maximum gradient that would be obtained if the entire
drainage had a "straight" meander pattern. The reader can get some sense of the potential
scale of channel patterning by examining the paleogeography of the lower Guadalupe
River valley proposed by Weinstein (1992:Fig. 10-1).

Now that some of the deficiencies in Table 2.3 have been identified, the important
thing to note is that the gradient estimates steadily diminish from 18,000 uncal BP to
7000 uncal BP, regardless of whether the meandering or valley-axis estimates are used.
This suggests that rising sea level had an effect on coastal plain stream gradients, despite
the lengthening of the channels that occurred during lowstands.

Over long distances, stream profiles have a concave-upward longitudinal profile
(Morton and McGowen 1980:Fig. 3), and local gradients may differ markedly from the
overall gradients presented here. At present, the Coleto Creek segment of the drainage
has a much steeper gradient (0.50 m/km) than the Guadalupe River segment (0.13 m/km),
just as we would expect, since the former is a mixed-load stream and the latter is a

254

suspended-load stream. Gradients may have been locally heterogeneous. The local creek
gradient near the site is even higher (1.57 m/km). Likewise, for the river,
For example, between Victoria and the river mouth, sinuosity [of the Guadalupe
River] changes from 2.24 to 1.03; width/depth ratio decreases from 8.1 to 5.8; and
channel gradient decreases from 1.73 ft/mi (0.33 m/km) to near 0 along lower
reaches of distributary channels (Morton and McGowen 1980:52).
Dredging of the lower Guadalupe River channel, at least as far as Kemper's Bluff,
was begun in 1857 (Rose 1961:26-28) and, except when interrupted by the Civil War, has
been continued to the present. Maximum bankfull depth in the delta area is 16 feet (4.9
m; Donaldson, Martin, and Kanes 1970:Table 1). Logjams and debris rafts may have
locally altered gradients, and there may have been times when lower Coleto Creek
extended a meander belt ridge out onto the Guadalupe River floodplain, if the river was
unable to flush it away.

Wright (1980:82-83) makes an important observation about the submerged
Nueces River channel â although the depth of the channel base at the continental shelf
break is unknown, projecting the part that is known seems to indicate it lies at about 79
m, which is well above the Wisconsinan lowstand of -120 m. Wright suggests this means
the river was still downcutting when postglacial sea level began to rise again. In other
words, the river was not yet in equilibrium with its base level, even though it had several
millennia over which to adjust its gradient. If adjustment to lowered base level was
significantly lagged, adjustment to rising base level may have been even more delayed.

Examination of meander patterns on USGS maps gives some idea of the progress
of adjustment to postglacial base level. Both the lower Guadalupe River and the lower
255

part of Coleto Creek (as far upstream as Raisin) snake actively back and forth within
wide valleys. If Coleto Creek is followed upstream from its confluence with the river, it
can be seen that the creek enters a confined valley at Raisin and remains within it,
following a much straighter course, for the duration of its travels through the Goliad
Formation, into which it is rather deeply incised. It is not clear whether the previous
history of valley entrenchment is the chief control on the channel pattern here, or whether
the channel pattern is a reaction to the postglacial history of base level. Ouchi (1985:Fig.
12) attributes increased sinuosity of the Guadalupe River and San Antonio River in this
vicinity to bedrock deformation in the Post-Vicksburg flexure zone.
Relatively little is known about the effects of rising base level on stream behavior.
A study by Berendsen (1995) of paleochannels of the Rhine over 50 km inland from the
present coast of the Netherlands showed that periods of accelerated Holocene sea level
rise were marked by episodes of rapid avulsion of the river. This suggests base level
control may extend at least this far upriver in flatlying terrain.

Geomorphologists have used experimental scale models of drainage to investigate
the effects of different hydrologic variables. In one such study, following artificial base
level lowering,
Incision occurred first at the mouth of the basin, and then progressively upstream,
successively rejuvenating tributaries and scouring the alluvium previously
deposited in the valley. As erosion progressed upstream, the main channel became
a conveyor of upstream sediment in increasing quantities, and the inevitable result
was deposition and formation of a braided stream.... However, as the tributaries
became adjusted to the new baselevels, sediment loads decreased, and a new
phase of main-channel erosion occurred (Schumm 1977:75-76).

256

Schumm refers to this lagged reaction to base level lowering as complex response
of the drainage system. The implication is that 1) changes in base level may have a
wavelike effect that ripples throughout the drainage system, but 2) significant time lags in
response may occur. In the Coleto Creek case, it might be relevant to ask whether any of
the perceived Holocene changes in stream behavior represent long-delayed responses to
Full Glacial base level lowering.

In any case, the gradient history of the Coleto Creek-Guadalupe River drainage is
of more than academic interest, because it is significant for understanding the
aggradational history of Berger Bluff. In a later chapter I will argue that the creek bed at
the site has probably experienced pronounced vertical movement (both up and down)
during the Holocene, related both to climate history and perhaps to whatever we can
deduce about gradient history.
Changing postglacial basin boundaries
Mapping by Berryhill (1981a, b) indicates that at the nadir of the Wisconsinan
lowstand, the Guadalupe/San Antonio river basins were united with the Lavaca/Navidad
river basins and the Tres Palacios Creek basin in a single drainage system (Fig. 2.8), and
remained so until sea level rose above approximately the 26 m bathymetric contour,
somewhat before 8500 RCYBP uncal, and covered the confluence area, which now lies
over 27 km offshore. Later mapping by Berryhill (1987:Fig. 2-2) seems to indicate a
revised paleogeography, with all of these drainages joining the Mission River, Nueces
River, and Los Olmos Creek / Palo Blanco River to form a single unified drainage
flowing southward toward the Rio Grande estuary. In other words, the 1987 version
seems to indicate all of the streams of the southern and central coast between the Rio
257

Grande and Brazos River were tributaries to a unified river system. Potential effects of
this enlargement on fluvial behavior of Coleto Creek are unknown. The enlarged
drainage area encompasses regions that today vary from slightly more humid to much
more arid than the Berger Bluff catchment, and may have been likewise in the
Pleistocene.

Gulf of Mexico water temperature history: literature review
Past water temperatures for the Gulf of Mexico have been estimated with 1)
transfer functions that compare modern planktonic foraminifera species with known
temperature requirements to assemblages found in marine cores, 2) oxygen isotope data
from foraminifera in cores, and 3) gas chromatograph analyses of alkenones extracted
from sediments in cores. Further information comes from the known history of meltwater
influx from the Mississippi River, based on modeling of the Laurentide ice sheet, studies
of alluvial deposits in the Mississippi River valley, and studies of percentages of
reworked foraminifera. Unfortunately, age control on many of the older (pre-AMS)
studies is poor. Many of the older studies are anchored only by a few known points â for
example, the core top is assumed to date to the present, and the Pleistocene-Holocene
boundary (easily recognized by the Holocene reappearance of the foraminifer
Globorotalia menardii) is taken as another known point. Points in between are simply
dated by interpolation, assuming a constant rate of sedimentation. However, the
Pleistocene-Holocene boundary (termed the Y/Z faunal boundary or the isotope stage 1/2
boundary) which is normally taken as 10,000 RCYBP in terrestrial records, has been
variously taken as 13,000 or 12,000 or 11,000 RCYBP in marine core research. In
records that have been orbitally tuned (adjusted to the scale of insolation cycles), other
ages may be assigned.

Brunner (1982) studied 17 marine cores from the Gulf, looking specifically at the
time interval she estimated as 18,000 BP uncal, based on extrapolation from the Y/Z
boundary (estimated at 11,000 BP uncal based on radiocarbon dating in the Caribbean).
The cores are undated, however. She used transfer functions to estimate paleotemperature
and paleosalinity from modern foraminifera assemblages. She estimates that at the glacial
261

maximum, Gulf waters were 1Â° to 2Â° C cooler and 0.3 â° less saline in winter than at
present, and 1Â° C cooler and 0.6 â° more saline in summer than at present (the present
average summer temperature is about 29Â° C, and along the western continental shelf, the
winter temperature ranges from about 18Â° to 21Â° C). Estimated summer temperatures in
the western Gulf, offshore from the Texas central coast, ranged from about 26Â° C to 26.8Â°
C (Brunner 1982:Fig. 3). One core (K147) collected in the Gulf east of Port Isabel
suggests a summer temperature 3.3Â° C cooler than at present (Brunner and Cooley
1976:Fig. 3). The salinity differences suggest that in winter, the Mexico Basin was
fresher than at present because the climate was more mesic, but in summer evaporation
rates rose, and the climate was more arid.

Several studies of cores from the Gulf have examined oxygen isotope history. The
earliest work by Emiliani treated the isotope curves as indicators chiefly of temperature
history. Since then, it has become clear that the isotope content of microfossils is
controlled both by the ambient seawater temperature and by the isotopic composition of
the water itself, which is heavily influenced by the rate of meltwater influx. During
glacial meltwater episodes, meltwaters that are highly depleted in 18O (typically about -35
â°) flowed into the Gulf and mixed with surface seawater slightly enriched in 18O (about
+1.7â°) by evaporation to yield large negative

18

O signals recorded in foraminifer shell

chemistry. Current opinion holds that the rate of meltwater influx accounts for around 7075% of the isotope signal (Dawson 1992:9-10). Unfortunately, it is difficult to separate
the temperature and meltwater components of the isotopic signal.

Leventer, Williams, and Kennett (1982) studied oxygen isotopes in foraminifera
from a piston core (EN32-PC6) extracted from the Orca Basin (see Fig. 2.9, D for
262

location). This is a fairly detailed record (samples every 5 cm through the meltwater
interval, and every 10 cm elsewhere), but initial attempts at age control were poor, based
on a single carbonate radiocarbon date at 3915 RCYBP and on the Y/Z biostratigraphic
boundary, again assumed to date 11,000 BP. The age of the bottom part of the core is
simply extrapolated. Based on these age estimates, meltwater discharge first appears at
16,500 RCYBP uncal, with a major pulse from 14,900-11,600 RCYBP uncal, with a
magnitude of 2.6 â°. After the isotope minimum at 11,600 RCYBP, the curve begins to
rise again toward negative values that are more or less typical of the Holocene (Leventer,
Williams, and Kennett 1982:Fig. 3). However, the age estimates are apparently too old.

Broecker and others (1988:Table 1) published 10 AMS assays on individual
foraminifera from this core and discovered a major age discontinuity from about 700011,000 RCYBP uncal. Their initial interpretation was that about 4000 years' worth of
sediment is missing from the section for some reason. To check the discrepancy, an
additional AMS assay at 436-437 cm (10,910Â±160 RCYBP uncal) was obtained
(Broecker et al. 1990:Table 5). The new assay suggested that perhaps no sediment was
missing, but instead four of the previous assays were erroneous for some unknown reason
(see Aharon 2003:page 3-8). The age-depth relationship for this core is shown in Fig. 2.9,
C, where the rejected assays are shown as open circles (no marine reservoir correction is
applied to this scattergram).

The oxygen isotope curve shown in Fig. 2.9, A is the same as that published by
Leventer, Williams and Kennett (1982:Fig. 1) and likewise by Broecker et al. (1990:Fig.
7), but with the most recent (and correct) dating. The assays listed in Fig. 2.9, A and B
come from the published date lists (with a 400-year marine reservoir correction applied)
263

and the illustration is patterned after Broecker et al. (1990:Fig. 7), but the dates I show
here differ from those in the original figure (discrepant dates are indicated by a question
mark). There is no apparent reason for the discrepancy, but since the values in Fig. 2.9
are derived directly from the published date lists, I presume they are the most accurate
radiocarbon estimates available. Some of the assays listed in Broecker et al. (1990:Table
5) are apparently new assays from samples assayed in Broecker et al. (1989:Table 2). The
isotope curves from both cores clearly show the presence of meltwater peak IA at about
11,800-12,000 RCYBP uncal, followed by a lack of meltwater during the Younger Dryas.
Core EN32-PC4 (Fig. 2.9, B) suggests a secondary meltwater peak (IB) at about 10,090
RCYBP uncal, but EN32-PC6 (Fig. 2.9, A) just shows stabilization at Holocene values,
rather than a discernible peak.

There are a few additional earlier studies that are worth reviewing, even though
they predate the improved AMS dating of the Orca Basin cores. Kennett, Elmstrom, and
Penrose (1985) studied foraminifer assemblage composition from Orca Basin cores,
chiefly EN32-PC6 and EN32-PC4. They use an age-depth model patterned after
Leventer, Williams, and Kennett, but assign an age of 10,500 BP to the Y/Z boundary.
They identify a glacial assemblage, replaced at about 16,000 BP by a meltwaterinfluenced assemblage, next replaced at about 12,000-10,500 BP (Younger Dryas) by a
return of the glacial assemblage. They claim that by 10,500 BP "the oxygen isotopic data
indicate attainment of Holocene surface-water temperatures" (Kennett, Elmstrom, and
Penrose (1985:207). Late Holocene (post-5000 BP) assemblages indicate warmer
temperatures than the early Holocene assemblages.

Flower and Kennett (1990) also studied foraminifer assemblage composition and
isotope content from cores EN32-PC6 and EN32-PC4. They obtained seven AMS dates
from the latter. The foraminifer assemblages indicated cold surface waters until 14,000
BP, warming until 11,600 BP, a temporary cold meltwater spike at 11,400 BP, continued
cool surface waters from 11,200-10,200 BP, with Holocene warming thereafter; "surface
water temperatures between 11.4 and 9.8 ka were similar to those marking the late
glacial" (Flower and Kennett 1990:955). The oxygen isotope record integrates both the
deglaciation history and the surface water temperature and suggests a meltwater spike
from 14,000-10,800 BP, peaking at about 12,200-12,100 BP (Flower and Kennett
1990:Fig. 1; all of these dates are in uncalibrated radiocarbon years BP, with a marine
reservoir correction). Flower and Kennett cite only 5 AMS dates for this core and
apparently did not have available the full suite of dates cited by Broecker and others.
Brown and Kennett (1998) place the meltwater spike at about 12,000-12,600 RCYBP.

Spero and Williams (1990) also restudied the same core (EN32-PC6), looking at
11 selected intervals in detail, and attempted to differentiate the effects of temperature
and meltwater by using the

18

O chronology provided by Fairbanks (1989). They

apparently had access to the first set of AMS assays cited by Broecker and others (1988),
but do not comment on the proposed sedimentary hiatus. They calculated estimated
annual temperature ranges for surface water (Spero and Williams 1990:Table 2), but the
summer temperature estimates are far too high, higher even than modern temperatures,
suggesting that the meltwater component has been underestimated. The data suggest that
meltwater at 11,800 BP probably flowed year-round, then during the Younger Dryas was
confined to the summertime, but resumed year-round flow afterward in the early
Holocene.
269

Marchitto and Wei (1995) studied core EN32-PC4, using the chronology of
Broecker and others, looking at the percentage of reworked calcareous nannofossils
(Cretaceous and Tertiary fossils eroded from terrestrial deposits) as a measure of
meltwater outflow. According to this measure, meltwater outflow was greatest (pulse IA)
in the Bolling warm interval at 12,700-12,200 RCYBP uncal, declining until the
beginning of the Younger Dryas. Contrary to other studies, they find no evidence of pulse
IB after the Younger Dryas.

Several more recently studied cores have much better resolution and absolute
dating control than these older studies. Aharon (2002; 2003) reports a series of seven
piston cores from the Louisiana continental slope, northwest of the Orca Basin. A
composite record from these seven LOUIS cores is estimated to extend from 18,400 to
about 800 RCYBP; the oldest AMS assay is 16,000Â±270 RCYBP (Aharon 2003:Table 1;
with 400-year marine reservoir correction). The sampling interval is 5-10 cm, with
chronological resolution decades to centuries (Aharon 2003:page 3-7). These cores are
closer to the meltwater outlet, and in an area with higher sedimentation rates than the
Orca Basin, and the higher resolution and improved dating in these cores reveal a
complex history of meltwater floods that was obscured in the earlier studies. Aharon
defines five major meltwater flood (MWF) events (Fig. 2.9, E), two of which correspond
to the meltwater pulses 1A and 1B recognized earlier by Fairbanks. The most prominent
events are MWF2 at 13,600-13,200 RCYBP and MWF4 (or pulse 1A) at 12,250-11,200
RCYBP (Aharon 2003:Table 3). The cessation of meltwater during the Younger Dryas is
also documented (Fig. 2.9, E, F). Aharon (2003:Table 3) designates this interval Pause 4,
at 11,200-9,970 RCYBP.
270

Of even more interest is a series of four meltwater events designated MWF5A,
MWF5C, MWF5E, and MWF5G between 9,970 and 8,900 RCYBP, during and after the
Preboreal Oscillation (Aharon 2003:Table 3; âLate Paleoindianâ in the Texas
archeological chronology). These were recognized collectively in some of the earlier
studies as Meltwater Pulse 1B, but in the LOUIS cores these can be discriminated as a
series of separate flooding events. These continued to introduce significant volumes of
glacial meltwater (although not as large as MWF 2 and 4) into the Gulf after the Younger
Dryas, during a period when insolation was near its peak (Fig. 1.2, A). This must have
served to maintain regional cooling to some extent, and to offset the effects of increased
insolation. Table 2.4 lists the meltwater events that are relevant to the present study.
Mississippi River discharge is listed in sverdrups (a sverdrup is a very large unit of
discharge equivalent to a million cubic meters per second).

The timing of these events was determined by meltwater releases from glacial
Lake Agassiz into the Mississippi drainage, and the fact that meltwater was still being

271

released as late as 8900 RCYBP might suggest that hurricane development in the Gulf
was delayed until after this date.

Another recently studied, high-resolution core (RC12-10) was obtained in the
western Gulf, about 210 km east of the Tamaulipas shoreline, at N 23Â° 95.33Â° W. Unlike
the other cores reviewed here, it records an area distant from sources of meltwater, and
about five degrees of latitude south of Berger Bluff (Fig. 2.9, I). It was sampled in 1-2 cm
increments, with eight AMS assays on foraminifera, ranging from 15,310Â±45 to 540Â±35
RCYBP (with a 400-year marine reservoir correction; Poore et al. 2003:Table 1). This
core presents a very different isotope history. The isotope signal seems to be reversed,
with a negative 18O trend during the Younger Dryas and restrained positive trends when
meltwater pulses are known to appear in the other records, such as the LOUIS cores (Fig.
2.9, G, based on data from Dowsett, Verardo and Poore 2003). The reason is unclear.
Under present conditions, the inner shelf current flows north along the lower Texas coast
in spring and summer, and southward in fall and winter. The fall/winter southward
current transports fresh water from rivers along the northern Gulf (Morey et al. 2003).

Estimated winter sea surface temperatures are shown in Fig. 2.9, H. These are
based on transfer functions developed by comparing foraminifer assemblages in sea-floor
surface mud samples to water temperatures measured nearby. The most conspicuous
feature is a dramatic warm spike at 9000 RCYBP that seems to coincide with MWF5G,
listed above. Winter temperatures are 21-23Â° C before then, with the Younger Dryas
marked by a subdued decline in temperatures (see the shaded band in Fig. 2.9, H). Most
summer temperature estimates are near 29Â° C, but are not considered reliable because of
poor inadequate core-top calibration for summer temperatures (Poore et al. 2003:page 26272

6). In general, the temperature changes indicated in the core are relatively small (Poore et
al. 2003:page 26-5).

Although the Orca Basin and LOUIS cores have helped to clarify the meltwater
and oxygen isotope history of the Gulf, a clear and well-dated warm-season temperature
history is still lacking. Better temperature estimates come from a study (Jasper and
Gagosian 1989) of unsaturated alkenones preserved in sediments from the Pigmy Basin,
south of the Mississippi delta (Fig. 2.9, D). Alkenones are waxy organic compounds
produced by marine algae, often coccolith-bearing species. The ratio of di-unsaturated
(C37:2) to tri-unsaturated (C37:3) alkenones is known as the UK37 ratio, and the lower
the ratio, the colder the surface water. The core (DSDP 619) studied by Jasper and
Gagosian is dated by linear interpolation from three biostratigraphic boundaries
(including the Y/Z boundary), the Y8 volcanic ash layer, and a single AMS date at about
24,000 BP (Jasper and Gagosian 1989:605-606). It comes from a deep (2259 m) basin on
the continental slope.

Unfortunately, alkenone paleothermometry does not differentiate summer and
winter surface water temperatures, so the estimated temperatures are presumably most
comparable to annual averages; the estimated precision is about Â±0.5Â° C. The estimates
(Fig. 2.10) show surface temperatures rising to 21.3Â° C at 11,000 BP, falling to 20.2Â° C
at 8500 BP, reaching a minimum of 19.9Â° C at 7500 BP, and rising thereafter to a high
point of 25.6Â° C at 2900 BP. The older part of the curve corresponds reasonably well to
the insolation curve (compare with Fig. 1.2, A), but the later Holocene aspect does not
match at all. The alkenone temperature curve matches the shape of the oxygen isotope
curve presented by Flower and Kennett (1990:Fig. 4) tolerably well, at least for the part
273

before 11,000 BP. At present, summer temperature runs about 4Â° C above the mean
annual temperature, so if the same relationship prevailed in the past, the alkenone curve
would indicate summer temperatures of 26Â° C (the critical level for hurricane formation)
were not reached until about 6000 BP.

Figure 2.10. Alkenone Estimates of Surface Mixed Layer Paleotemperature in the Gulf of
Mexico. Plotted here are part of the data from the Pigmy Basin published by
Jasper and Gagosian (1989:Table 1); see text for details of age estimation,
and previous figure for location of core. The most recent data point is 1800
BP. The critical heat level for hurricane formation is about 26Âº C, the top
boundary of the graph; note that the curve presumably approximates annual
temperature, not summer temperature, which is higher. Todayâs average
annual temperature is about 24.5-25.5Âº C, shown as a horizontal band near
the top. The vertical shaded band is the period spanned by the bench
deposits at Berger Bluff.
274

Jasper and Gagosian draw attention to the fact that their estimates of the
maximum difference between glacial and modern SSTs are about 8Â° C, in comparison to
the 1Â° to 2Â° C difference calculated by Brunner and Cooley (1976), and suggest that their
results are more useful as stratigraphic markers than as absolute temperature estimates.
They may have unjustly discounted their own findings, however. The CLIMAP project in
the 1970s followed Brunner and Cooley's estimate of a 1-2Â° C shift in tropical areas, but
some of the latest research from tropical areas, both marine and terrestrial, suggests the
shift varied between about 2Â° C and 5.5Â° C in different areas (Broecker 1996, Colinvaux
et al. 1996, Thompson et al. 1998). Alkenone temperature estimates can be affected by
dissolved nutrient concentrations (Epstein et al. 1998).

Another source of meltwater history is the alluvial record of the Mississippi River
itself. The Laurentide ice sheet functioned like a two-way switch, alternately releasing
meltwater to the St. Lawrence or to the Mississippi drainage, so that the meltwater
histories of the two drainages are heavily antiphased (Marshall and Clarke 1999:309).
During the Herman stage, Lake Agassiz contained about 10,900 km3 of meltwater
(Leverington, Mann, and Teller 2000:Table 1). A review by Saucier (1994b) indicates
that meltwater flowed down the Mississippi from about 16,300 RCYBP to about 11,000
RCYBP uncal, when it was interrupted (during the Younger Dryas) by diversion into the
St. Lawrence channel, followed by a final pulse of meltwater at roughly 10,000-9800
RCYBP uncal (this agrees very well with the Tahiti coral data). Porter and Guccione
(1994) estimate the ages of these two meltwater pulses at 11,300-10,900 RCYBP uncal
and 9900-9500 RCYBP uncal. A recent geomorphological study of the Lake Agassiz
spillway in the Minnesota River has used radiocarbon dating to pin the end of the first
pulse at 10,800 RCYBP and the end of the second pulse at 9400 RCYBP (Fisher 2003).
275

By then (Upper Campbell stage), Lake Agassiz was even larger (22,700 km3;
Leverington, Mann, and Teller 2000:Table 1), but furnished less outflow to the
Mississippi. Additional physical evidence of glacial outwash in the Mississippi River
valley is provided by the Charleston Fan, near Charleston, Missouri, which is not well
dated but was likely formed close to 10,900 RCYBP, during meltwater pulse IA (Porter
and Guccione 1994).
Gulf of Mexico water temperature history: summary
Insofar as the above history can be reconciled, there were several pulses of cold
meltwater entering the Gulf of Mexico during deglaciation of North America, a major
pulse (IA) during the Bolling-AllerÃ¶d warm period, a near cessation of meltwater during
the cold Younger Dryas at 11,000-10,000 RCYBP, and a second, but much reduced pulse
(IB) at the beginning of the Holocene, at perhaps 10,000-9800 RCYBP (or 9700-9100
RCYBP according to Aharon, 9900-9500 RCYBP according to Porter and Guccione, and
before 9400 RCYBP according to Fisher). The second pulse resulted from a readavance
of the Superior lobe of the ice sheet, which once again diverted meltwater into the
Mississippi drainage. In addition, the high-resolution record from the Louisiana
continental shelf suggests there were at least three additional pulses, the last of which
(9,970 to 8,900 RCYBP) was actually a cluster of four discrete flood events.

That much seems clear, but when did average summer surface temperature in the
Gulf rise to 26Â° C or greater (the critical point for hurricane formation)? The temperature
estimates of Spero and Williams seem much too high to be plausible. The alkenone
estimates of Jasper and Gagosian (Fig. 2.10) cannot be resolved into summer and winter
components, and do not match the known meltwater history; a temperature peak at about
276

13,000-11,000 RCYBP actually occurs when the first major influx of cold meltwater is
shown to have arrived in the Gulf. The transfer function-based estimates from core
RC12-10 off Tamaulipas offer high resolution, but only for winter temperatures. About
all that can be said with the information at hand is that the first 26Â° C summer
temperatures were probably achieved sometime in the early Holocene, likely after pulse
IB, and perhaps somewhat after 9000 RCYBP uncal. A date after 9000 RCYBP would
follow the major warm spike shown in the Tamaulipas core, and would follow the final
major meltwater episode ending at 8900 RCYBP in the cores from the Louisiana
continental shelf.
HURRICANE FORMATION IN THE GULF OF MEXICO
Hurricanes in the Gulf are fed by heat extracted from the water below, and as they
move across the Gulf, they tend to follow tongues of warm water, leaving cooled water in
their wake. Heat is the energy source for barometric pressure differences, winds, and
transport of moisture. A significant pool of warm water is necessary, and although either
a large mass of moderately warm or a smaller mass of very warm water will suffice, a sea
surface temperature of 26Â° C is usually taken as the minimum temperature for hurricane
formation (Leipper and Volgenau 1972:220). Wendland (1977) arbitrarily used the 80Â° F
isotherm (26.8Â° C) as a unit of study, and found that tropical storms and hurricanes do not
form in the North Atlantic unless the mean monthly area with temperatures of 26.8Â° C is
at least 8,500,000 km2 in size. Hurricane formation is more likely where warm water
persists to considerable depth, generally about 60 m (Gray 1979:208). Direct measures
before and after storms have shown that hurricanes can extract about 4000
calories/cm2/day. The most likely area for formation of these large pools of warm water
is in the central Gulf, due to periodic intrusion of very warm Caribbean water via the East
277

Gulf Loop Current (Leipper and Volgenau 1979:220; Chouinard, Liu, and Cooper 1997).
Pools of warm water over the continental shelf do not form hurricanes, but they may help
to steer one to a particular landfall along the coast. As Figure 2.11 shows, pools of warm
water 26Â° C or higher in temperature may extend to depths as great as 60 m in warm
years over the south Texas continental shelf, when they also may persist as late as early
November (note isotherms for station "B" in 1977, off Corpus Christi).

Figure 2.11 (following page). Water Temperature by Time and Depth in the Gulf of
Mexico. Shown here are data for 1976 and 1977 from two stations offshore
from Corpus Christi [adapted from Flint (1981:Fig. 3) and Brooks et al.
(1981:Fig. 4)]. The area enclosed by the 26Âº C isotherm is shaded, and is
noticeably deeper and more prolonged in 1977 than in 1976. Note difference
in depth scale between stations âAâ and âB.â Map shows location of
sampling areas; contours in meters.

279

Hurricanes in the northern hemisphere mostly form somewhat south of the N 20Â° parallel
(Gray 1979:Fig. 8), but a significant number either form in the Gulf or enter it. At
present, the chief months for northern hemisphere hurricane development are July,
August, September, and October, with a long-term average of 11.5 hurricanes/month in
September (Fig. 2.12, based on Gray 1979:Table 2). The most severe tropical storms on
the south Texas coast have arrived in August and September (Berryhill n.d.: Table 5).

Figure 2.12. Average Number of Tropical Cyclones Per Month in the Northern
Hemisphere. Data for 1958-1977, from Gray (1979:Table 2). Compare this
distribution with that of water temperature shown in the previous figure.

280

These, of course, are the months when pools of warm water are available (Fig.
2.11 and Berryhill n.d.: Fig. 19, 23). The significance of the insolation maxima discussed
in Chapter 1 should now be apparent. Although average annual insolation peaked at about
10,000 RCYBP uncal (Fig. 1.2, A), August and September insolation did not peak until
after 8000 RCYBP uncal (Fig. 1.4). This, combined with limited amounts of meltwater
persisting until 9800 RCYBP uncal or later, suggests that hurricanes were probably
absent from the Gulf until the early Holocene (somewhere in the span 8000-9800
RCYBP). On the other hand, since August and September insolation levels were actually
higher than at present from about 10,000 BP on, these early Holocene hurricanes may
have been more severe than contemporary examples. The monsoonal climates of the
eighth, ninth, and tenth millennium before present may have produced some very severe
tropical cyclones in the Gulf of Mexico. Recall, also, that contemporary hurricanes are
uncommon in El NiÃ±o years because strong westerly winds aloft shear off the tops of
tropical cyclones before they can develop. Strong winds aloft are thought to have been
characteristic of the Pleistocene as well, and are another reason for supposing that
hurricanes are essentially a Holocene phenomenon.

Geological evidence of such storms in coastal environments is, of course, now
submerged. Holocene deposits thought to be hurricane-produced have been found (Davis,
Knowles, and Bland 1989; Donnelly et al. 2001; Liu and Fearn 1993, 2000a, b; Scott et
al. 2003), but they are mostly Late Holocene in age. One study of vibracores in
Apalachicola Bay, Florida, identified at least five separate discontinuities in grain-size
parameters that were thought to be evidence of major storm events. These occur below
woody material radiocarbon assayed at 7340 and 7990 RCYBP uncal (Isphording and
Isphording 1991:Fig. 3). Peaks in storm-derived inwash layers have been found as far
281

back as about 10,240 RCYBP (11,900 cal BP) in lakes in Vermont and New York, but
there are several types of storms besides tropical disturbances that might have been
responsible (Noren et al. 2002). A simulation study by Hobgood and Cerveny (1988)
suggested the Full Glacial sea surface contained enough heat energy to sustain "minimal"
hurricanes, although they were less severe than modern storms. Their study, however,
was based on CLIMAP temperature estimates that are probably too high, and it does not
include the meltwater-influenced Gulf of Mexico. Inoue and Welsh (1996) have done a
numerical simulation of Gulf oceanic circulation under last Glacial Maximum conditions
(before major meltwater input), but they, too, use CLIMAP data. Their simulation
produces a larger anticyclonic gyre off the Texas coast in both summer and winter (Inoue
and Welsh 1996:Fig. 34b, 35b), and it shows most of the western Gulf with temperatures
above 26Â° C at the surface, but not at 40 m or below (Inoue and Welsh 1996:Fig. 40). The
Loop Current is weaker in their full glacial simulation, introducing less warm water than
at present. Because the Glacial Maximum simulation predates the major meltwater
spikes, uses CLIMAP temperature estimates that are probably not low enough, and uses a
model level boundary set at 40 rather than 60 m, there is probably nothing in either of
these simulation studies to suggest the presence of Pleistocene-aged hurricanes.

282

OTHER PALEOENVIRONMENTAL SITES IN THE GUADALUPE-SAN ANTONIO RIVER
BASINS
Sources of paleoenvironmental information for the transition to the Holocene in
the Guadalupe-San Antonio river basins are few, especially in the lower basins. Some of
these are shown in Fig. 1.26. The most important sites are a pair of peat bogs at Ottine
(Hershop and Soefje Bogs), an archeological site (Richard Beene) at San Antonio, a
sinkhole (Winston's Cave) at Camp Bullis, and a cave site (Hall's Cave) with
paleontological data at the head of the Guadalupe River basin in Kerr County. Besides
these, there are a few other paleoenvironmental sites, but they mostly pertain to later parts
of the Holocene. Some limited information is available from the River Spur site in
Victoria, and from Friesenhahn Cave, near Bulverde.

Besides supplying different kinds of proxy environmental indicators, these
different classes of sites have different accumulation histories. In contrast to alluvial sites,
which often have sedimentation rates that decline as time progresses, sedimentation rates
in Central Texas sinkholes may be episodic or may have accelerated in the Holocene. At
Hall's Cave, for example, the time resolution seen in the late Holocene part of the record
is not nearly as detailed for the Pleistocene-Holocene transition. Peat bogs may have
accumulation rates that are apparently linear (Hershop Bog) or markedly declining
through time (Patschke Bog), which gives much better time resolution for the
Pleistocene-Holocene transition.

283

South Soefje Bog (Gonzales County)
This is one of a cluster of sphagnum peat bogs at Ottine (Chelf 1941), 96 km to
the west-northwest of Berger Bluff. This unique area has a number of disjunct or relictual
Austroriparian plant and animal species (Graham 1958:38; Raun 1959; Fullington 1974)
and is not floristically representative of the lower Guadalupe River basin now. Alan
Graham collected a core in 1957 from a site he called South Soefje Bog, and obtained a
single radiocarbon assay (Humble Oil and Refining Company, run 501) of 7820Â±350
RCYBP uncal from the base, which presumably means a depth of 4.7 m. The core was
divided into 5 cm increments, but only every other increment was analyzed for pollen (47
samples). J. Potzger and B. Tharp had apparently sampled both this bog and another
called North Soefje Bog some years earlier, but had never published the results (Graham
1958:8). Bryant (1969:45) also collected a core in April, 1967, designated South Soefje
Bog, although according to the landowner, not the same one sampled by Graham.
Bryant's core was 4 m deep, divided into 10 cm increments, and is undated.

Graham and Bryant obtained similar results. Both cores have relatively uniform
pollen spectra from top to bottom, with rather small variations at various levels,
indicating vegetation similar to that of the present. Since the base of Graham's core
appears to lie at 7470-8170 RCYBP (at 1 ), apparently both cores extend no farther back
than the early Holocene. Graham reports a single grain of sweetgum (Liquidambar sp.) at
the 3.9 m level (Graham and Heimsch 1960:Table 1), and Bryant (1969:84) reports
hazelnut (Corylus sp.), which is now extirpated in Texas. The latter consists of single
grains at 2.0-2.1, 2.1-2.2, and 3.7-3.8 m. Oak, grasses, ragweed, pecan/hickory,
composites, ash, sedges, Umbelliferae (Apiaceae, or carrot family, such as hemlock), and

284

pine are among the most common pollen types for the section as a whole. Spruce and fir
pollen was not found.
Hershop Bog (Gonzales County)
This bog lies south of Soefje Bog and is considerably deeper. In 1967-68, Tom
Patty and Vaughn Bryant collected two cores (5.4 and 5.0 m deep, spaced 10 m apart)
from Hershop Bog; Patty also obtained another from a bog he designated East Hershop
Bog (Patty 1968:41-42). The deepest core (I) was analyzed in 54 increments of 10 cm
each and was surrounded by five additional cores used for radiocarbon sampling. The
radiocarbon samples were 20 cm increments, an upper increment collected at 0.3-0.5 m,
middle increment at 2.3-2.5 m, and a lower increment in each radiocarbon sampling
probe. The lower increments vary somewhat from probe to probe (two at 4.8-5.0, one at
4.4-4.6, and two at 4.9-5.1 m). Fifteen assays were produced this way (Patty 1968:Table
1; Valastro and Davis 1970), but due to the sampling plan these are grouped into three
groups of five duplicate samples each, so that major intervening segments of the cores are
left undated. The lower group assayed about 10,576Â±77 RCYBP uncal and the middle
group 6004Â±51 RCYBP uncal, according to CALIB 3.03 weighted averages.

Patty reports that there are no major intrusions of clastic sediment in the peat, and
the three blocks of assays suggest a near-linear accumulation rate. In view of this, it may
be permissible to try to interpolate dates for major changes in the pollen spectrum. I have
used curve-fitting with the top of the bog fixed at zero years BP. The assays are not
weighted by standard error. The resulting curve (Fig. 2.13) does not differ greatly from a
linear solution, except perhaps at the ends of the curve. At the base of the curve, the fitted
curve suggests slower deposition rates, but it is not clear if this part of the model is
285

appropriate. Patty (1968:13) reports that sand (evidently with no pollen recovered) was
found at the base of the core from 5.4 to 5.5 m. In any case, the part of the curve after
11,000 RCYBP should be reasonably accurate. The age model used here is defined as
depth (m) = a + b x2 * log(base e) x + c x3
where

a = 0.068926139
b = 0.11718496
c = 0.000062160465
x = age in radiocarbon years

Figure 2.13. Age-Depth Model for Hershop Bog. Radiocarbon assays (dots) plotted are
uncalibrated dates from Patty (1968:Table 1), with the age at the surface
assumed to be zero years BP. Fitted curve is described in the text.
286

Unless noted otherwise, dates cited in the following discussion are estimates from
the fitted curve. The age-depth model suggests the base of the bog dates to the very end
of the Bolling-Allerod period at about 11,730 RCYBP uncal, and the Younger Dryas
should be represented by deposits from 4.78-5.19 m.
Birch pollen was found from the base of the core up to the 4.7 m level (about
9842 RCYBP uncal), when it was apparently extirpated from south Texas. The birch
peak occurs at about 10,500 BP (Fig. 2.15, B). The birch pollen, identified as Betula
nigra (river birch; Larson, Bryant, and Patty 1972:365, may very well be an indicator of a
mesic Younger Dryas interval. As its name indicates, river birch is a riparian species. It
grows in the southeastern US where optimum annual rainfall is about 100 cm (range,
71.5-162.0; Thompson, Anderson, and Bartlein 1999). Alder pollen (Alnus sp.) was
found sporadically in slight quantities throughout the core, but is somewhat more
frequent in the bottom part; it is another member of the birch family that is now
regionally extirpated (Alnus serrulata is found in east Texas today and is another riparian
taxon). Patty designates the lowest part of the core from the base to 4.7 m as his "birch
pollen zone." It is marked by moderate levels of birch, elm, and oak pollen, relatively
little grass pollen, and very little pollen from the Umbelliferae. Sweetgum pollen was
found at the 5.2 m level (about 11,035 BP). The "birch pollen zone" covers the end of the
Bolling-Allerod, all of the Younger Dryas, and part of the first two centuries of the
Preboreal. Patty also notes
Analyzed samples from a 0.5-m core taken from the bottom (5.2-5.7 m) of a
recently discovered peat deposit designated by this writer as East Hershop Bog
has revealed a pollen sequence which parallels the Hershop profile....The birch
pollen peak occurred at the 5.7-m level and gradually decreased upwards. Most of
the other pollen types were observed at all levels but the birch pollen was absent
above the 5.0-m point. Radiocarbon dating of the East Hershop Bog was not
obtained and stratigraphic correlation will not be attempted (Patty 1968:41-42).
287

A plot of the arboreal/non-arboreal (AP/NAP) pollen ratio in the main Hershop
Bog cores shows tree pollen peaking at about 10,386 BP, then declining rapidly to 9741
BP (Patty 1968:Fig. 8); grass pollen peaks at 3.8 m (Patty 1968:Fig. 7), or about 8312
BP. In summary, the Hershop Bog cores seem to document fairly fast regional drying
over a transitional period lasting some 650 years, beginning at the Younger Dryas peak,
about 10,400 RCYBP uncal. Larson, Bryant, and Patty (1972:366) summarize this as "a
change from an upland parkland to savannah vegetation, and an associated change from a
closed to open canopy forest in the more mesic flood plain areas." Huisache and mesquite
are important components of the regional vegetation (huisache is more characteristic of
the Berger Bluff catchment to the east-southeast), but Acacia pollen was found only in
modern surface samples. Prosopis pollen was found in surface samples and the topmost
10 cm core sample.

Vaughn Bryant also studied the same 5.4 m core analyzed by Patty, but he
examined 28 samples extracted at 20 cm intervals (Bryant 1969:87). Curiously, he found
insufficient pollen for study in the upper 80 cm; no explanation for the discrepancy
between this and Patty's results is given. Otherwise, the results are very similar to but not
identical to Patty's. Bryant found a few taxa not reported by Patty (Populus, Vitis, Rhus;
see Bryant 1969:Fig. 10). A single sweetgum grain was found at 2.8 m.

Further examination of the Hershop Bog pollen counts
A subset of the original pollen counts produced by Patty have been placed in the
North American Pollen Database (NAPD) and is available for downloading from the
World Wide Web. This data set is for the 70 most common pollen types found throughout
288

North America, so some of the original categories have been combined (Typha, for
example, is reported by Patty but does not appear as a separate type in the NAPD). I have
extracted some of these counts, standardized them by the total grain count per sample,
and plotted them against the age-depth model shown in Fig. 2.13. Figure 2.14, A shows
the number of taxa in the NAPD data set over time. This is not the total number of taxa
originally recorded by Patty, but the categories are consistent from sample to sample.
Species richness shows a long initial decline that appears to coincide closely with the
time span of the Berger Bluff bench deposits. Perhaps both better pollen preservation in
the lower levels of the bog, where conditions may have been more consistently anaerobic,
and greater taxonomic diversity in the Late Pleistocene are responsible for the shape of
the oldest part of the curve. Figure 2.14, B shows, for each sample, the number of taxa
plotted against the grain count. The lack of structure in the swarm of points suggest
sample size does not strongly influence diversity. Later chapters will show this is not
always the case for other kinds of proxy data, and in some cases rarefaction methods may
be necessary to investigate species richness. In any case, I conclude that the older part of
the bog section is not strongly biased by taphonomic factors.

Figure 2.15, A shows grass and oak pollen. Oak shows a long decline beginning
before the Younger Dryas and continuing until about 8500 RCYBP uncal. Grass pollen
begins a sharp increase at the end of the Younger Dryas (10,000 RCYBP uncal), peaking
at about 8000 RCYBP, suggesting a period of marked prairie expansion and reduction in
tree canopy in the early Holocene.

In Fig. 2.15, B, arboreal pollen types are divided into bog-dwelling or riparian
trees (alder, birch, elm, and willow) and non-bog-dwelling or "upland" trees (ash,
hackberry, hickory/pecan, maple, pine, oak, sweetgum, and walnut). Actually, most of
the latter taxa are quite at home on floodplain terrain, and in that sense could also be
considered riparian trees, but they are not likely to be found in boggy habitats.
Hackberry, for example, commonly borders streams in upland areas, but is not as likely
in swampy habitats. Fig. 2.15, B shows riparian trees peaking in the Younger Dryas, then
nearly vanishing at 9171 RCYBP uncal. "Upland" trees peak at the beginning of the
Younger Dryas, declining throughout the period represented by the bench deposits,
reaching a minimum at about 8500 RCYBP uncal. This curve is essentially the same as
that for oak shown above.
Figure 2.16, A repeats the oak pollen curve and shows another curve for sedges
(Cyperaceae), which ought to be an adequate index of groundwater conditions in the bog.
Sedge pollen shows a peak at 8645 RCYBP uncal, followed by a sharp drop until about
8312 RCYBP uncal. This decline (modeled here as lasting about 330 years at Hershop
Bog) matches almost exactly the evidence for cessation of spring discharge at Berger
Bluff, and presumably represents regional drying and lowered water table levels. One
291

thing that is not clear, however, is why the riparian tree pollen decline seen in the
previous figure should significantly anticipate that of the sedge pollen.

Figure 2.16, A also shows that sedge and oak pollen are positively correlated until
about 7500 RCYBP, after which they are negatively correlated. The reason for this is
likewise unclear. Presumably almost all of the oak pollen is from postoak and blackjack
oak, species that grow on well-drained, sandy terrain around the bog. One might expect
positive correlation between the sedge and oak curves throughout the Holocene, since
both should perhaps respond positively to increases in effective moisture.

Figure 2.17 shows the distributions of Apiaceae (carrot family, formerly
Umbelliferae) and Asteraceae (sunflower family, pioneer plants in disturbed habitats)
pollen. The Apiaceae peak in the late Holocene at about 3575 RCYBP, but are absent or
scarce in the earliest samples. The Asteraceae show three intervals (at about 825-3160,
5340-5970, and 7830-8480 RCYBP) of rapid increase followed by equally rapid decline.

Figure 2.17. Hershop Bog, Pollen Distribution for Apiaceae and Asteraceae. The
Apiaceae (formerly Umbelliferae, carrot family) show a distinct peak in the
late Holocene. The Asteraceae (sunflower family), pioneers in disturbed
habitats, show three intervals of rapid fluctuation at about 1000-3000, 5500,
and 8500 BP. Counts from Patty (1968) as tabulated in NAPD, 70 Common
Pollen Types, standardized by total grain count per sample. Sample ages

296

These presumably represent intervals of time (about 630 years or longer) during which
significant areas of disturbed habitat were first created, then revegetated by climax
associations. The first of these begins at about 8480 BP, or roughly coeval with the top of
the bench deposits at Berger Bluff. This pollen type seems to show the clearest evidence
of possible cyclic frequency fluctuations.
Comments on bog palynology
Most of the principal Texas bogs that have been studied have few radiocarbon
assays. So far as I know, the only site where semi-close-interval dating has been applied
is Patschke Bog, where a set of 19 assays was obtained by Tom Stearns (reported by
Camper 1991:Table 2). There are many examples of date inversions in this series. The
most strikingly erroneous assay is one at 2255 BP bracketed by an assay of 15,220 BP
below and 17,290 BP above. Erroneous peat dates like these may be far more common
than anyone realizes (see Shore, Bartley and Harkness 1995), because if only one to three
widely spaced assays are obtained per core, the likelihood of an inversion is quite low, no
matter how erroneous the assay. If other bogs were as intensely assayed as Patschke Bog,
we might find an equally alarming number of erroneous dates. This probably applies even
where duplicate assays are run, as at Hershop Bog, because if chemical contamination is
the problem, duplicate assays are likely to furnish duplicate errors. Small samples of peat
separated into different fractions (alkali-treated peat, untreated peat, and moss fragments)
have furnished AMS radiocarbon dates that differ by as much as 365 to about 1000 years
(Nilsson et al. 2001). Some instances are also known of peat bogs showing a âreservoir
effectâ similar to marine reservoir age offsets, in which peat samples may assay as much
as 200-250 years older than the true radiocarbon age (Kilian, van der Plicht and van Geel
1995; Pancost, Baas, and DamstÃ© 2000). The mechanism is poorly understood, but may
297

involve the evolution of methane gas from older deposits at the base of the bog. Peat
samples can also assay anomalously young if stored wet and contaminated by fungal
growth (Wohlfarth et al. 1998) or if contaminated by younger penetrating plant roots.
The obvious conclusion is that researchers should be cautious about placing too much
faith in the chronologies of any of the existing bog cores. That applies to the age model
used here for Hershop Bog, as well.

Peat bogs have usually been approached interpretively by looking for consonant
changes in frequency distribution that affect large parts of the pollen spectrum, drawing
boundaries between "pollen zones" where several taxa seem to increase or decrease in
concert, as Camper has done at Patschke Bog. This approach views a biotic assemblage
or community as an ecological system responding to climatic stages. However, most
biologists now feel that both plants and animals show individualistic responses to
climatic change, and if one of the pollen diagrams is examined, it can be seen that nearly
all taxa show frequency fluctuations, but the fluctuations are not synchronized.

The chronology for Patschke Bog, in Lee County, appears to resemble that for
Hershop Bog fairly well (Camper 1991:Fig. 3). The Holocene increase in grass pollen
appears to begin here at about 10,000 RCYBP uncal as well; however, here oak pollen
increases at the same time as grass. Sedge pollen, which is variable in the Holocene at
Hershop Bog, increases in much the same way as grass and oak pollen. Birch becomes
uncommon at roughly 8200 RCYBP, disappearing at roughly 5500 RCYBP, which is
later than at Hershop Bog. At Boriack Bog, the Holocene increase in grass pollen appears
at perhaps about 8500 RCYBP [Bryant 1969:Fig. 7; or slightly later according to
Bousman (1994)], while birch pollen is simply uncommon throughout.
298

There seems to be no sharply defined Younger Dryas pollen signal in any of these
bogs. The period is characterized by an abundance of arboreal pollen (particularly alder at
Patschke and Boriack), but frequency increases tend to begin well before (at least by the
Oldest Dryas, in the European chronology) and persist long after the time limits of the
Younger Dryas.

The River Spur Site (41 VT 112)
This archeological site was investigated by the Office of the State Archaeologist
in 1993 (Cloud et al. 1994) and by the 1995 Field School of the Department of
Anthropology, University of Texas at Austin (Thomas R. Hester and Michael B. Collins,
principal investigators). Buried in the five-meter terrace of the Guadalupe River in the
Victoria municipal park, the sediments here apparently record a relatively well-drained
floodplain (either of a small tributary stream or of the river itself) succeeded by
obstruction of the drainage and the development of an oxbow lake that dried seasonally
and gradually infilled by sedimentation. A fairly good microsnail fauna (Brown 1997)
and some microvertebrates (well-preserved but spotty in distribution) were recovered.
Bulk sediment samples were collected for radiocarbon assay, but none have been
submitted. The site has no chronological control, although the basal deposits are believed
to be Late Paleoindian in age, based on cultural material recovered, and presumably are
about the same age as the top of the bench deposits at Berger Bluff. The snail fauna
appears to respond chiefly to habitat succession at the site, rather than to regional
environmental changes.

299

The Armstrong Site (41 CW 54)
This site, located on the San Marcos River in Caldwell County, has radiocarbon
assays extending from 2400Â±60 RCYBP to 9160Â±40 RCYBP (Schroeder 2002:47;
Appendix H), and the oldest assayed deposits probably overlap slightly with the most
recent bench deposits at Berger Bluff. Magnetic susceptibility, carbon and nitrogen
isotope, diatom, phytolith, pollen, plant macrofossil, freshwater mussel, and vertebrate
studies were done (Schroeder 2002, Schroeder and Oksanen 2002), but none of the data
illuminate early Holocene environmental change very well, nor do they reveal much
about the abruptness or magnitude of climatic change at the transition to the Holocene.
The most informative data perhaps come from pollen and vertebrates. The oldest pollen
(and carbon isotope) samples were collected from paleochannel fill and include pine and
Artemesia pollen (Schroeder 1999) that I suspect represents long-distance transport from
the Edwards Plateau. There are also freshwater sponge spicules in the sediments
(Schroeder 2002:149). Vertebrates include muskrat and (tentatively) Bison antiquus, but
no microvertebrates except Geomys bursarius.
The Richard Beene Site (41 BX 831)
The Richard Beene site is an archeological site located south of San Antonio on
the Medina River, a tributary of the San Antonio River; it has supplied some
paleoenvironmental data (chiefly mollusks, carbonized plant remains, and sediments).
Charred bois d'arc wood (Dering and Bryant 1992, but not listed in their Table 2) was
recovered from deposits dated 8805Â±75 and 8640Â±60 RCYBP (13C adjusted charcoal;
Alston Thoms, personal communication).
The snail data pertain mainly to habitat succession. Snail samples 25-31 were
collected from soils 6, 7, and 8, which have assays ranging from 12,745Â±190 RCYBP
300

(charcoal) to 15,270Â±170 RCYBP (bulk carbon in sediments, which here generally dates
about 1000 years older than charcoal; Alston Thoms, personal communication) and
consist almost entirely of Deroceras slug plates, indicating a marsh or cienega habitat.

An overlying and more recent set of samples (18-23) comes from the C horizon
below the Elm Creek paleosol, and from the Perez paleosol, which has dates ranging
from 8805Â±75 RCYBP (charcoal) to 10,130Â±120 RCYBP (bulk carbon, soil parent
material; Alston Thoms, personal communication), suggesting these deposits are
contemporaneous with part of the bench deposits at Berger Bluff. This mollusk
assemblage includes Gyraulus parvus, Cincinnatia cincinnatiensis, Helisoma anceps,
Succinea solastra, and Rabdotus mooreanus, and indicates
an open savannah with scattered woody vegetation and substantial grass cover.
The periodic moist conditions, often followed by rapid desiccation would seem to
indicate the occurrence of periodic alluvial input with flood debris. Local
precipitation would seem to be low to moderate and, possibly seasonal in
occurrence (Neck 1992).
Deposits (capped by the Medina and Elm Creek paleosols) above these levels
suggest midgrass prairie and date from the middle or possibly early Holocene. Delta 13C
values measured for soil carbon in these paleosols suggest elevated temperatures and
higher proportions of C4 plants at 11,000-10,000 RCYBP and 6000-4800 RCYBP (Nordt
et al. 2002:Fig. 3). This timing of events for the carbon isotope sequence does not agree
very well with the few values for the Berger Bluff deposits. Applewhite Î´ 13C values
during the period 8500-11,000 RCYBP mostly vary from about -19.9 to 21.0 and form a
fairly tight cluster, although there is one value of -22.4 at 9200 RCYBP (Alston Thoms,
personal communication). Nordt and others (2002) interpret the less negative 13C values
during the estimated Younger Dryas part of the profile (the section between about 8800
301

and 12,700 RCYBP is undated) as an indicator of an increase in the proportion of C4
plant cover, and hence locally higher temperatures during the Younger Dryas. This
conflicts with the evidence from higher latitudes, and since the site is in a riparian
corridor, it is not clear why the spike toward less negative values could not as easily be
due to reduction in riparian tree cover, since trees are C3 plants. At present, the Medina
River channel near the site is lined with cypress trees, all of which are C3 plants.
Reduction in tree cover could have derived from flood events, for example (floods on the
Guadalupe River in recent years have removed many cypress trees). Annual grasses are
customarily thought to have much more influence on soil isotope ratios than perennial
trees, but this might not necessarily be true in closed canopy riparian corridors. Another
possibility is that the interpolated age of the Perez paleosol is in error. It is worth noting
that a small negative spike in C4 plant cover at the top of the Elm Creek paleosol appears
to correspond well to the 8200 cal BP event (see Nordt et al. 2002:Fig. 3). In this case,
the known climate event and the direction of isotope change appear to be in agreement.
Winston's Cave (Bexar County)
Radiocarbon assays from bulk sediment (n = 9) in this sinkhole on Camp Bullis
are somewhat problematical and are offset somewhat from the two charcoal assays
(Hudler 2000:Table 4-13). The oldest date on sediment is 10,790Â±80 RCYBP, and the
proposed age-depth model for the site estimates the age range of the matrix column at
6270-10,790 RCYBP. If the assays and age modeling are correct, the section likely
includes all of the Younger Dryas. Excavation was done in 5 cm levels. Pollen (analyzed
by John Jones), snail (analyzed by Richard Fullington), vertebrate (analyzed by David
Froelich), and magnetic susceptibility data are available. The snails include 11 terrestrial
taxa and one aquatic species (a single example of an extirpated Pleistocene species from
302

level 50). The base of the column (levels 32-54) shows greater species richness, and
according to Fullington, there is some indication of aridification from level 28 up to the
surface of the deposits (Hudler 2000:81). The pollen samples are somewhat poorly
preserved, but include small amounts of sweetgum pollen (Hudler 2000:Fig. 4-19). There
are no pollen data before about 9900 RCYBP (estimated date; Hudler 2000:70). The
magnetic susceptibility samples show a trend of increasing low-frequency values from
the Younger Dryas right through the middle Holocene. Taken at face value, this should
imply increasing environmental moisture, which is contrary to expectations.
Friesenhahn Cave (41 BX 177, Bexar County)
Friesenhahn Cave is located at the eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau, at an
elevation of about 349 m (1145 ft), not far from the Balcones Escarpment; it has some
scattered cultural material around the entrance (hence the trinomial designation), but is
chiefly a paleontological site. This sinkhole was extensively excavated by the Texas
Memorial Museum in 1949 and 1951 (Evans 1961), and additional excavations were
done by Graham (1976) in the 1970s. Graham excavated in 10 cm levels but describes the
stratigraphy in natural depositional units. He also collected pollen samples, seven of
which were processed by Stephen A. Hall, with the results eventually published much
later by Hall and Valastro (1995). Interpretation of this site is rendered difficult because
all three investigators use different systems of stratigraphic nomenclature. Graham
provides a reconciliation of his and Evans's systems (Graham 1976:Table 1), but Hall
gives no explanation. Judging by the sediment descriptions, apparently Hall's "gray clay"
equals Graham's units 2B and 3A, his "red clay" equals Graham's unit 3B (and 3C?), his
"red fill" perhaps equals Graham's units 3D (?) and 2F, and his "black fill" must equal

303

Graham's unit 2G. Graham wet-screened his sediments through 1/16-inch mesh, but the
collection method for the TMM party is not specified.

This site has good pollen and vertebrate data, but unfortunately age control is very
poor. Apparently, there are at least 12 radiocarbon assays. Ten of these are reported by
Graham (1976:Table 2) and have been critiqued for reliability by Toomey (1993:Table
2). Another assay (Tx-1768, 19,880Â±430 RCYBP) comes from "the middle of the
sequence." The University of Texas Radiocarbon Laboratory ran separate assays on
apatite, collagen (and in one case, dentine) fractions from mammoth and rodent bone
from units 3A, 3B, 3C, and 2C. Unfortunately, the collagen content was so small that
very large standard errors (as much as Â±4340 years) resulted, and there are major
discrepancies between the apatite and collagen fractions. In two cases the collagen
fraction is older, and in two others the apatite is older. The dates are probably sufficient
to indicate that units 3A and 3B are likely Full Glacial in age, but the assays for units 3C
and 2C are so wildly variable that I consider them of unknown age. Graham assigns them
a post 10,000 BP age (Graham 1976:29), although mammoth bone (assayed at 4890 and
9640 BP) is present, and mammoth is not normally considered to have survived into the
Holocene here.

Certainly, the age control at this site is inadequate to allow us to identify the
Pleistocene-Holocene boundary, measure its abruptness, or even discern whether it is
preserved here, nor can we learn anything about the presence or absence of a Younger
Dryas signal. It seems likely that the earliest units, at least (Zone 1, units 2A, 2B, 3A, and
3B) predate the bench deposits at Berger Bluff. Graham (1976:221) proposes that the

304

cave was sealed and did not receive sediments from 12,000 to 10,000 RCYBP, but I think
the dating is too questionable even to establish that with any certainty.

Friesenhahn Cave contains a number of extinct [mammoth, mastodon, tapir,
peccaries, horse, bison, camel, dire wolf, shortfaced bear, sabertoothed cats, tortoises
(Geochelone wilsoni), box turtle hybrid (Terrapene carolina putnami X T. c. triunguis),
toad (Bufo woodhousei bexarensis)] and extralimital (short-tailed shrew, southern bog
lemming, cotton mouse, cactus mouse, eastern chipmunk, and perhaps pine or prairie
vole) vertebrate taxa (Graham 1976; Holman 1969; Martin 1968; Preston 1979). All of
the extralimital species are ones that are now found to the east and/or north, in wetter or
cooler climates. The best example is perhaps the eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus).
Graham (1984) calculated these indicate summers either 7.5Â° C cooler and 120 mm
wetter than today, or else 300 mm wetter, if temperatures were the same as today.
However, Toomey (1993:24) suggests an increase of only 10 mm/month in NovemberMarch would enable these chipmunks to survive in Central Texas, or 15 mm in June and
30 mm of additional precipitation in July.

Hall recovered small amounts of spruce pollen from the "gray clay" unit, which is
consistent with a Full Glacial of possibly Late Glacial age (and the assays of 14,020 and
19,600 RCYBP). The "gray clay" and "red clay" also contained fairly abundant pinyon
pine pollen and little oak pollen. Small amounts of sweetgum pollen were found in the
"gray clay" and the modern "black fill" (Hall and Valastro 1995). Hall concludes that the
...Edwards Plateau had less tree pollen (Pinus, Juniperus, Quercus) than modern
shortgrass and tallgrass prairies, although the Edwards Plateau may have had
small populations of pinyon pine and deciduous taxa (hickory, ash, elm, walnut,
alder, liquidambar) in riparian and canyon habitats.... Given a more equable but
305

cooler and moister climate, as indicated by mammalian faunas in the southern
Great Plains, the glacial-age herbaceous prairie communities may have been
composed of some assortment of species that differ from present-day prairie
floras (Hall and Valastro 1995:243-244).
Hall's Cave (= Klein Cave, 41 KR 474, Kerr County)
Hall's Cave, formerly known as Klein Cave, is located on the high surface of the
Edwards Plateau at 677 m (2220 ft) above sea level, at the head of the Guadalupe River
basin. In fact, the divide marking the head of the basin lies only about a kilometer farther
to the northwest. Because of its elevation and distance from the Gulf, this locality is
somewhat cooler and less influenced by Gulf moisture than Berger Bluff, and it would
not be surprising to find it has a somewhat different paleoenvironmental story to tell. At
present, the Gulf shoreline lies about 358 km down-basin, and at the Wisconsinan
lowstand, would have been about 446 km away. Excavations were done by Roth (1972)
in 1966-68; by a geologist, Collins, in 1968-70; and by Toomey (1993) beginning in
1986. This is another site which, like Friesenhahn Cave, has both vertebrate fauna and
pollen preserved. There is an extensive series of radiocarbon assays (Collins 1995:379),
most of which (like the pollen analysis) remain unpublished. A snail fauna was
recovered, but it also remains unpublished. Some carbon isotope findings (Toomey,
Huebner, and Boutton 1992) have been published. Toomey excavated, for the most part,
in 5 cm levels and washed the matrix through nested 2.5 mm and 1.2 mm screens. From
the initial set of radiocarbon assays, it appears that the stratigraphy is somewhat
compressed below about 8000 RCYBP (this is most easily seen in Toomey 1993:Fig. 40),
which means that time resolution in the basal section is perhaps roughly 500 years per 5
cm excavation level.

306

The Hall's Cave data suggest significant warming by the Oldest Dryas/Bolling
intervals (14,500-12,500 RCYBP, probably with open grassland present), with continued
warming to about 11,500 RCYBP, with temperatures close to modern after that (Toomey
1993:448). There is no detectable Younger Dryas temperature signal. A moisture signal
beginning at 13,500 RCYBP is provided by the ratio of desert shrews, Notiosorex, to
least shrews, Cryptotis. This suggests increasing aridity from 12,300-10,400 RCYBP
(parts of the Bolling, Older Dryas, Allerod, and Younger Dryas), with a return to slightly
wetter conditions at 10,400 RCYBP, followed by resumed aridity, peaking in the midHolocene (Toomey 1993:450-451. The more extensive set of assays suggests a mesic
interval that corresponds fairly well to the Younger Dryas (Collins 1995:Table 2), with
further aridification at about 9000 RCYBP.

The Late Glacial fauna from Hall's Cave is disharmonious. Toomey (1993:461)
identifies several allopatric species pairs (Notiosorex crawfordi-Synaptomys cooperi,
Myotis velifer-Sorex cinereus/haydeni, Myotis velifer/Zapus hudsonius) that suggest mild
winters and cool summers, plus gopher tortoises (Geochelone wilsoni) and extinct
roadrunners (Geococcyx californianus conklingi) that suggest much the same thing.
Other sites
Studies of speleothems in various caves in the Guadalupe River basin indicate the
late glacial period was wetter than present, but there are too few uranium-thorium dated
speleothems to detail the climatic chronology.
However, water levels at least 7 m higher than the present did occur throughout
most of the Lower Glen Rose in the Guadalupe River basin during the Late
Pleistocene based on levels of resolutioned speleothems (the TB stalactite was
more than 10 m above modern base level). Recent calcite deposition has hidden
most of the resolution that occurred in Cave Without a Name, but extensive
307

canopies and other unusually-shaped speleothems (e.g., the âBomb Burstâ) are
indicative of a Guadalupe River basin water table at least 7 m higher than its
current elevation. In the Cibolo Creek basin, excellent examples of resolutioned
speleothems in Cascade Caverns and other caves prove the water table was more
than 20 m above its current elevation (Veni 1997:265).

A single humate date (7300Â±190 RCYBP, Î´

13

C is -15â°) from Camp Pearl

Wheat, in Kerr County pertains to a period of fine-grained deposition, with savanna
habitat inferred (Collins et al. 1990:92), but is too recent to record the transition to the
Holocene.
GLACIAL-AGE CALICHE AND OTHER RECORDS IN DEEP SOUTH TEXAS

There are a few south Texas paleoenvironmental sites that are far too old to be
comparable to Berger Bluff, but nevertheless interesting because they hint at either arid
or mesic conditions during the late Pleistocene. These include a number of sites with
carbonate that is ostensibly pedogenic in origin and ostensibly Full Glacial or Late
Glacial in age. Some of these are rather puzzling. The first is an exposure of "caliche"
(presumably a pedogenic soil carbonate horizon) six miles west of Karnes City, and about
30 km southwest of the southwestern boundary of the Berger Bluff catchment. A series of
seven radiocarbon assays on both massive caliche and caliche joint fills ranges from
13,750Â±230 to 20,310Â±430 RCYBP uncal, but the joint fills are more variable in age and
may incorporate carbonate from bedrock. Three assays on the massive variety average
17,470 RCYBP, suggesting seasonally arid conditions during the Full Glacial (Valastro
and Davis 1970:623-624). No Î´ 13C determinations are reported. This location is at N 28Â°
52' 31" which is close to the latitude of Berger Bluff. This record is problematical in view

308

of the indications of greater effective moisture and reduced seasonality in the Late
Glacial period that were discussed in Chapter 1.
McBride and Honda (1994) studied in situ beachrock, beach clasts, and clasts in
Intracoastal Waterway spoil piles from Padre Island and the Laguna Madre (Cameron
County north to Nueces County). Two-thirds of the samples they studied showed
evidence of calichification, and radiocarbon assays ranged from 18,300 to 27,250
RCYBP uncal. They conclude that "this was a time of low sea level during the late
Pleistocene and a feasible time for calichification. Nevertheless, the dates should be
viewed with skepticism" (McBride and Honda 1994:470). Other samples of marine
limestone, sandstone, or shelly sandstone produced assays of 13,200, 30,900, and 38,000
RCYBP, and the authors suggest that at these dates, sea level was far below the level of
the samples, indicating that the assays are spuriously recent (but see below). The Î´

13

C

values for the calichified samples vary widely and range from -0.5 to -8.4, with an
average somewhere near -4.0 â° (McBride and Honda 1994:Table 1).
Prouty (1996) studied outcrops of coquina with karst features (solution pipes and
laminated crusts) along the west shore of the Laguna Madre just south of Baffin Bay, in
Kenedy County. The coquina includes open Gulf and bay-type mollusks but is now
exposed subaerially. It has radiocarbon assays ranging from 25,750 to 32,370 RCYBP
(Prouty 1996:Table 1). Again, as in the previous case, sea level at that time would have
been much lower. Prouty offers two possible explanations, neither particularly
convincing: 1) contamination by younger carbon, or 2) enhanced levels of radiocarbon
due to a cosmic flux event at 60,000 BP. The laminated caliche crusts occur on the
coquina, and the solution pipes penetrate it, some of them extending below present sea
level. She suggests that
309

During the glacial advance the regional climate was wetter than today, promoting
karstification. Solution pipes probably originated through leaching of the
limestone bedrock associated with plant respiration, perhaps concentrated in local
soil pockets occupying depressions on the coquina surface....With the
commencement of the Holocene... the climate of south Texas gradually became
drier. Regional precipitation diminished, and karstification of the coquina finally
ceased about 7000 yr B.P. (Prouty 1996:350).
Assays on the crusts range from 7720Â±90 RCYBP to 16,450Â±210 RCYBP uncal
(Table 2.5), and in all three cases where upper and lower crust layers were assayed
separately, the underlying layers are older. As can been seen, these range from the late
Full Glacial, through the Younger Dryas, into the early Holocene. Prouty suggests that
the crusts are formed partly from carbonate mobilized from the coquina, and partly from
carbon of atmospheric origin, so that the true ages are younger than the assays. The Î´ 13C
values for the crusts range from -2.1 to -8.0 â°, and average about -5.0 â°.

Another possible example of calichification is found in 14 m of Gulf water, 3.2
km offshore from Padre Island, south of Baffin Bay (Thayer, La Rocque, and Tunnell
1974). This is a former freshwater lake bed, now submerged, that has filled with
sediments and carbonate and exists as inverted topography on the seafloor. It is undated
but has Columbian mammoth, mastodon, and bison remains as well as land snails and
freshwater aquatic snails (Planorbella trivolvis and Physa sp.) and presumably existed as
a seasonal lake on part of the shelf exposed by the Late Pleistocene sea level drop. The
sediments apparently contain both marl and carbonate redistributed by pedogenic
processes.

Inland to the west of this location is a pair of sites, La Paloma Mammoth site (41
KN 17) and Indian Hill (41 KN 18) situated along Palo Blanco Creek near the western
border of Kenedy County. Suhm (1980:79) lists the trinomial designation for La Paloma
as "41 KN 78" (sic), but that is erroneous. La Paloma Mammoth Site consists of bones of
Columbian mammoth, mastodon, horse, Bison antiquus, ground sloth, and unidentified
snakes, fish, and amphibians (plus crab remains) discovered in place in clay-rich alluvial
sand associated with Palo Blanco Creek, which according to Suhm is the dry, underfit
remnant of a larger Late Pleistocene stream. Deer antler and glyptodon scutes were also
recovered from the backfill. Indian Hill is a much smaller isolated site located to the east,
311

and well to the north of the Palo Blanco channel. Raymond Neck (1981) studied snails
from both sites, finding aquatic snails (Planorbella trivolvis, Biomphalaria havanensis,
and Physa [Physella] virgata, all of which are found at Berger Bluff as well) at La
Paloma only. Neck concluded that these taxa, along with the crab ossicles, indicated the
presence of stagnant, brackish water. Certainly the fish, amphibians, and grazing animals
seem to indicate a period with somewhat greater soil moisture and runoff than at present.
There is at least one paleosol and some evidence of calichification in the alluvial
sediments overlying the bone bed (Suhm 1980:90). Farther upstream along Palo Blanco
Creek, about 24 km west of Falfurrias, Hubricht reported "large numbers of freshwater [
snail ] shells of northern species such as Valvata tricarinata (Say)....The aquatic species,
most of which are species of permanent bodies of water, would also indicate that the
climate was much wetter than at present" (Hubricht 1962:1).

A series of radiocarbon assays (Table 2.5) from bone and teeth range from 8080
RCYBP to 9830 RCYBP. Taken at face value, these would indicate an early Holocene
age, but the dates are probably much too recent. Radiocarbon assays on extinct North
American megafauna that are later than 10,000 RCYBP (Meltzer and Mead 1983) or in
some cases perhaps even 12,000 RCYBP (Grayson 1987) are likely to be spurious, and it
seems unlikely that extinct proboscideans would survive as late as 8000 or 9000 BP on
the Rio Grande alluvial plain. One mammoth bone fragment (Tx-2195) retained enough
collagen for a conventional assay, although not a useful one. In summary, this site hints at
somewhat higher levels of effective moisture, but for the time being its age must be
regarded as essentially unknown.

312

The Petronila Creek site (41 NU 246) located near Driscoll, in Nueces County
(Fig. 1.26), has a fairly extensive set of radiocarbon assays (Lewis 1988, 1996; Johnson
1993). A buried stratum of fine sand with an extensive Rancholabrean fauna has assays
that are Full Glacial in age (18,180Â±330 RCYBP on Mammuthus jeffersoni apatite,
17,190Â±400 and 16,880Â±380 RCYBP on organics bound to clays immediately overlying
the sand stratum. In some areas there are pea-sized caliche nodules or sheets of caliche in
the sand, and seams and nodules of caliche also occur in the overlying clay-rich strata.

Bob Lewis (personal communication) believes that present Petronila Creek is also
underfit in comparison to its Full Glacial discharge, and the fauna includes a good many
aquatic or riparian taxa: muskrat (?), alligator, pond

and softshell turtles, frogs,

salamanders, fish (including large gar), freshwater mussels, and aquatic snails (Lewis
1996:Table 1). These (especially the alligator and very large gar) indicate a significant
and reliable water source. At the same time, there are many taxa (mammoth, Bison
antiquus, horse, Capromeryx, black-tailed prairie dog, jackrabbit, plus saltbush seeds)
that indicate grasslands on the surrounding Beaumont prairie surface. There are well over
200 prairie dog teeth alone. Johnson (1993:106) interprets the small mammal fauna as
representative of a shortgrass prairie, although the riparian taxa seem to suggest greater
effective moisture.

CONCLUSIONS
1. Significant radiocarbon plateaux are present during the estimated span of accumulation
of the bench deposits, at 10,400, 10,000, and 9600-9500 RCYBP uncal, but most of

313

the radiocarbon assays from Berger Bluff fall between these plateaux. Only one of the
assays falls in the 10,000 BP plateau.

2. The Younger Dryas, an important episode of climatic cooling that lasted 800 years,
from about 10,897-10,091 RCYBP uncal (usually rounded off to 11-10 K), is best
known from the North Atlantic region. It also occurs elsewhere in the world, but in
patchy fashion. It is not yet clear whether its occurrence was truly mosaic in nature, or
if the gaps are simply due to poor records. Much of the newest evidence suggests it
was a global event. The Younger Dryas is followed in the Preboreal and Boreal by a
few other less well defined cooling events, about which even less is known.

3. The evidence for a Younger Dryas climatic signal in the Guadalupe and San Antonio
river basins is equivocal. Some of the pollen types (mostly notably birch and sedge) at
Hershop Bog show a response that is probably moisture-related at about the correct
time, if the age-depth model I have used is correct. However, I have only qualified
confidence in the age model because of the sampling interval and the frequent
discrepancies between bulk peat assays that have been found in other bogs. A possible
mesic period at about the same time at Hall's Cave may also represent the Younger
Dryas. Some of the pollen types that peak during the Younger Dryas actually show
increases that anticipate its start and persist after the end of the period, as defined in
the North Atlantic, a pattern that parallels the history of spring-related "black mats" in
the Great Basin (Quade et al. 1998).

4. Other sites in the basins either lack a good regional climatic signal or have insufficient
time resolution. None of them have the resolution or specificity necessary to address
314

the questions of abruptness and degree of climatic change posed by the Greenland
summit ice cores (as discussed in Chapter 1).

5. The best and most consistent data sets for evaluating postglacial sea level in the Gulf
come from coral reefs at Tahiti, Barbados, and the Huon Peninsula of New Guinea.
For the most part, these do not allow recognition of possible stillstands or regressions,
but they do a good job of portraying the main trend of sea level rise (Table 2.2), and
provide the basis for making some crude calculations of postglacial channel gradients
for Coleto Creek and the Guadalupe River.

6. Gradient calculations suggest that rising sea level caused coastal stream gradients to
diminish steadily, despite the lengthening of the channels that occurred during
lowstands (Table 2.3). Gradients may have been locally heterogeneous, however, and
adjustments to sea level may have lagged drastically, showing complex responses
(sensu Schumm 1977).

7. Evidence from high-resolution cores on the Louisiana continental shelf suggests there
were at least five major meltwater episodes, or Mississippi superfloods, during
deglaciation. The result of Bolling-AllerÃ¶d warming, four of these occurred before the
Younger Dryas, the largest two peaking at 13,380 RCYBP and 11,900 RCYBP, and
flooding ceased during the Younger Dryas cold spell. The last episode was actually a
cluster of four discrete floods between 9970 and 8900 RCYBP produced by peaking
summer insolation, and although these events were only about half the magnitude of
the largest superfloods, they may have had a major impact on regional climate by
continuing to introduce frigid meltwater into the Gulf during a period when insolation
315

was peaking, and possibly limiting warm-season sea surface temperatures below the
level necessary for hurricane formation. Land-sea thermal contrasts were also
probably at a maximum during this period, and this must have affected regional
climate as well. It may seem paradoxical, but the two periods of greatest warming over
the Laurentide ice sheet (the Bolling-AllerÃ¶d interval preceding the Younger Dryas,
and the early Holocene following it) were the periods when meltwater release through
the Mississippi probably created regional cooling in the Gulf of Mexico, with the
episodic nature of the cooling episodes due to blocking and unblocking of different
Lake Agassiz outlets.

8. Hurricanes form in the Gulf when a water temperature of 26Â° C is sustained for several
months, and usually extends to a depth of 60 m, and when El NiÃ±o-directed winds
aloft are not available to shear off the tops of the developing cyclones. At present,
July-October are the paramount months for hurricane development.

9. Despite all the research that has been done, we cannot specify when average summer
water temperatures reached 26Â° C. It was likely in the early Holocene, probably after
pulse IB (=MWF5), and perhaps somewhat after 9000 RCYBP. The earliest possible
geologic evidence for major storm events in the eastern Gulf seems to be before 8000
RCYBP. Alkenone paleothermometry and further foraminiferal studies hold great
promise for solving this question, but they must be supported by close-interval AMS
dating of the marine cores.

10. August and September insolation did not peak until after 8000 RCYBP (Figure 1.4).
This, plus persistent meltwater from MWF5 (Aharon 2003), suggests hurricanes were
316

absent from the Gulf of Mexico until the early Holocene (perhaps somewhere in the
span 8000-9800 RCYBP), but early Holocene hurricanes, once they began, may have
been more severe than contemporary examples because of greater insolation.

11. There are some records from south Texas that imply aridity during the Full Glacial.
Calichification, for example, is usually taken to imply climates that are at least
seasonally warm and have seasonally distributed rainfall. These records are too early
to be of direct concern here, but they might seem to imply the model of storm-track
displacement and equable rainfall presented in Chapter 1 is invalid. Because most of
these records are well to the south of N 30Â° latitude, and because the full age span of
most of them is not known, I do not think the model is invalidated.

12. Trees that are today confined to the wetter region of east Texas may have been more
widespread in south Texas in the past. Very small amounts of sweetgum
(Liquidambar) pollen â typically one or two grains in a single sample â show up in
early contexts at many of the sites considered here, such as South Soefje bog, Hershop
Bog, Winston's Cave, Friesenhahn Cave, as well as in the Leon Creek paleosol at the
Richard Beene site (Dering and Bryant 1992). It also shows up in sample 19 at the
Devil's Mouth site, dating sometime after 8780Â±310 RCYBP (Bryant and Larson
1968). Some of the alluvial or colluvial contexts might be due to reworking of
Pleistocene pollen, but I suspect sweetgum was actually present as a very minor
component of floodplain forests in south Texas well into the Holocene. Likewise,
birch may have been much more widespread than is generally perceived. Hazelnut
shows up in several levels at South Soefje Bog. The case for loblolly pine is
ambiguous, but as I mentioned in Chapter 1, its anthropogenic redistribution on sandy
317

Miocene bedrock in the study area seems to hint it could have been more widespread
in the past. Alder, birch, sweetgum and loblolly pine are all typical southeastern US
tree species today.

13. Both pollen and faunal records from the Guadalupe and San Antonio River basins
hint at greater species richness during the Late Pleistocene. Not only were floras and
faunas disharmonious, they were also more diverse. Some of this diversity probably
lingered on into the early Holocene in protected habitats such as escarpments and
riparian corridors. The evidence for this at Berger Bluff will unfold as the chapters on
various biotic fossils are presented.

14. If there is a unifying theme for the proxy records reviewed in this chapter, it is poor
age control. Except for recently excavated sites, such as Richard Beene and Hall's
Cave, which have better sampling resolution and significant AMS radiocarbon control,
the record is poorly resolved. Marine cores, peat bogs, caliche deposits,
paleontological sites, and sea level indicators all suffer from lack of AMS dating and
ambiguous assays.
