ABSTRACT

Golden Water Supply Corporation (GWSC) intends to install 29,035 feet
of pipeline and make improvements to an existing pump station in the area
surrounding the town of Golden in Wood and Rains counties, Texas.
There are six pipeline segments, W15 through W20, all which parallel
existing Farm to Market Roads or County Roads. AR Consultants, Inc.
conducted a pedestrian survey along these segments. The results of the
survey have demonstrated that the majority of the routes fall into areas of
low archaeological potential for prehistoric and historic sites due to their
distance from major rivers and their proximity to the road edge. Pipeline
section W18 is the exception, as it passes in front of the Golden
Community Cemetery. Per the recommendations of the Texas Historical
Commission, this section of the waterline will be bored to a minimum
depth of 10 feet under the asphalt parking lot with the beginning and
ending bore points being a minimum of 30 feet beyond the fenced
cemetery boundaries along the right of way. Since the remainder of the
routes has no recorded cultural resources, AR Consultants, Inc.
recommends that no further investigations are necessary. Based on these
recommendations, we suggest that construction can proceed for the
installation of the waterlines. We further recommend that if cultural
resources are uncovered during construction that work should cease in that
area and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission
should be notified.

INTRODUCTION
Golden Water Supply Corporation (GWSC) intends to construct 29,035 feet of pipeline
and make improvements to an existing pump station on a 0.47-acre site in the area
surrounding Golden in Wood and Rains counties, Texas (Figure 1). There are six separate
pipeline segments numbered W15 through W20 and all parallel existing Farm to Market
Roads or County Roads. The waterlines will be 6” and 4” in diameter and buried up to
36” deep. The construction easement is 30’, and the permanent easement is 15’. Pipeline
segment W18 passes in front of the Golden Community Cemetery. Per the
recommendations of the Texas Historical Commission on October 27, 2009, this section
of the pipeline will be bored to a minimum depth of 10 feet under the asphalt parking lot
with the beginning and ending bore points being a minimum of 30 feet beyond the fenced
cemetery boundaries along the right of way. The GWSC contracted with Environmental
Consulting Services (ECS) to conduct the environmental permitting and ECS contracted
with AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) to conduct an intensive pedestrian archaeological
survey of the proposed routes.

impacted by installation of the waterlines or pump station. The cultural resource
investigation was required because the GWSC received funding for the system
improvements from the Texas Water Development Board, which is a political entity of
Texas. Texas Antiquities Permit Number 5441 was issued for the archaeological survey.
This report was written in accordance with the report guidelines adopted by the
Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission and developed by the Council
of Texas Archeologists (n.d.). The following report presents a brief description of the
natural setting of the project area. This is followed by the cultural history portion of the
report. The research design and methodology follow, then the results of the field survey
are presented in the major section of the report. Recommendations conclude the text, and
lastly a list of references cited ends the report.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The Golden WSC system improvements are located in the southwest section of Wood
County and the eastern edge of Rains County, which is in the Post Oak Savannah
vegetation region of northeast Texas (Lipscomb, Diggs, and O’Kennon 1999). The
underlying geology is composed of three formations (Bureau of Economic Geology
1975). From east to west, silty, sandy clays with beds of clay, lignite, silt and quartzite
form the Wilcox Group undivided, very fine sand, silts and clays with ironstone form the
Carrizo Sand Formation, while brownish black to blackish gray silty clay with ironstone
concentrations compose the upper 100 feet of the Reklaw Formation.
The proposed waterline routes cross a variety of topographic settings. The western part of
the county has level to undulating terrain and sandy soils overlying clayey subsoils. Soils
near stream terraces are Bernaldo and Freestone fine sandy loam topsoil with mottled
yellow or yellowish brown clay that becomes grayer at greater depths. Within the
floodplains of major creeks, Manco loam is present. On the interstream divides, Wolfpen
loamy fine sand with yellowish brown and yellow sandy clay subsoil is present. Within
the uplands, dark grayish brown loam of the Woodtell-Raino complex with mottled red,
yellow brown and gray clay is present (Hatherly 2000).
Lake Fork Creek and the Sabine River flank the study area to the north and south, and
minor tributaries drain south into the Sabine. The climate is subtropical, mild and moist
(Gilbreath 2003:1). The Post Oak Savannah is bordered by the Pineywoods region to the
east, and the majority of trees are post oak and blackjack oak. Understory vegetation
includes green brier, sumac, poison ivy, yaupon, wild grape, dogwood, and a variety of
other species. Blair (1950:98) places Wood County in the Texan Biotic Province. Besides
the vegetation previously mentioned, the province contains at least 49 mammal species, 9
lizard species, 39 snake species and 18 amphibian species.

CULTURE HISTORY
Major archaeological investigations have been carried out in Wood County, and the
adjacent Rains County in conjunction with the construction of Lake Fork Reservoir and
the Big Sandy Project (Bruseth, Bagot, Banks and McKinley 1977; Bruseth and Perttula
1981). Two major historic Native-American sites, Limerick and Pearson (Duffield 1959;
Johnson and Jelks 1958; Duffield and Jelks 1961), were excavated at Lake Tawakoni in
Rains County, and several important sites were tested and then excavated at Lake Fork. A
reconnaissance of the proposed Carl Estes Lake [formerly known as Mineola Reservoir]
recorded several sites in the area located between Lake Fork and Lake Tawakoni (Malone
1972). Members of the Dallas Archeological Society located the historic Norteño focus
Gilbert site and then held a Texas Archeological Society Field School in Archeology
there in 1962 (Jelks 1967).
The following chronological framework relies heavily upon “This Everlasting Sand
Bed”: Cultural Resources Investigations at the Texas Big Sandy Project, Wood and
Upshur Counties (Perttula et al. 1986) and Prehistoric Settlement Patterns at Lake Fork
Reservoir (Bruseth and Perttula 1981). The chronological classification consists of:
Early Paleo-Indian
Late Paleo-Indian
Early Archaic
Middle Archaic
Late Archaic
Early Ceramic
Early Caddoan
Middle Caddoan
Late Caddoan

8000 to 6000 B.C.

A.D. 1200 to 1400
A.D. 1400 to 1700
A.D. 1700 to 1840
A.D. 1800 to present

Only meager evidence of Paleo-Indian occupation has been recovered in the region, and,
invariably, this period is represented by projectile points recovered from mixed contexts.
Bever and Meltzer (2007:Table 1) report two Clovis points from Wood County.
Plainview, Dalton, San Patrice and Scottsbluff projectile points have been recovered from
sites along Lake Fork Creek. Unfortunately, none of the points have been found in
context with Pleistocene-aged megafaunas. Bryant and Shafer (1977:19–20) state that
Paleo-Indian peoples were probably generalized hunter/gatherers rather than big game
hunters.
Early Archaic people occupied terrace areas and upland projections as did the earlier
Paleo-Indian people. Sites appear to be small suggesting a mobile life way with poorly
defined territorial boundaries and food resources appear to be generalized. There is some
suggestion of trade networks based on lithics used for dart projectile points. The Middle
Archaic is the first really recognizable archaeological unit in the Upper Sabine Basin.

Sites are concentrated within major basin systems and are usually single-component.
Subsistence appears to have concentrated on nuts and deer. Metates are found on the sites
indicating the occurrence of plant processing. Chert resources are non-local; therefore, a
trade system was established by this time. Late Archaic sites occur near springs, springfed branches and on small to large tributary streams as well as on elevated landforms
adjacent to streams. Sites have sedentary aspects suggesting definable territories and a
higher population. Exploitation of plants and animals seems to have been generalized.
Utilized lithic resources appear to be local and petrified wood was used, again
emphasizing a defined territory.
The Early Ceramic period is recognized by the presence of pre-Caddoan ceramics. Two
different ceramic technologies occur, one based on sand-temper and another based on
grog- and sometimes bone-tempered ware. The lithic artifact assemblage changed little
from the Archaic. Gary points appear to dominate the projectile point types. Earthen
middens containing storage and trash pits, hearths and other indications of relatively
permanent multi-seasonal occupations indicates that single-family homesteads may have
been occupied for one or two generations. Agriculture is inferred from the presence of
charred maize, but flotation analysis emphasizes the reliance on plant foods including
acorns and other nuts.
Early Caddoan components and sites are common throughout the major drainage basins
on major streams and tributaries to those streams. The bow and arrow appeared during
the Early Caddoan period and agriculture appears to dominate the plant food economy
although wild plants were still being used. Sedentary communities and farmsteads are
located adjacent to arable land. Mound centers along the Sabine indicate the presence of a
hierarchical social and settlement structure. The most common types of Early Caddoan
settlement in the Upper Sabine, however, are hamlets and farmsteads containing 1 to 3
middens. These middens represent small habitation areas and burials are found in the
middens. The Tadlock site, 41WD82, recorded by Southern Methodist University on
Lake Fork Creek is an Early Caddoan (Sanders Focus/Phase) site located on a combined
upland remnant/alluvial terrace in the Lake Creek Fork valley. The site consists of three
middens. The emphasis was on wild plants although corn and other cultigens were
processed. Several pipes were found indicating the use of tobacco or, at least, some plant
for smoking. Interestingly, lithic tool materials came from Red River gravels and Central
Texas instead of the poorer local material (Perttula 1995).
Middle Caddoan times appear little differently than Early Caddoan times in the Upper
Sabine River. The Carlisle site, 41WD46, probably typifies Middle Caddoan sites and
components in the major drainage basins. The site is located on the tip of an upland
projection overlooking the Sabine River floodplain and actually extends into the
floodplain and stops approximately 30 meters from the riverbank. The site is located
below the confluence of Lake Fork Creek and the Sabine River. The portion of the site on
the upland projection appears to have contained a house structure based on the presence
of daub and a mud dauber’s nest. The portion of the site in the floodplain is a midden.
Lithic materials were dominated by chert, but quartzite, chalcedony and petrified wood
were used. Ceramics were grog- and bone-tempered (Perttula, Skiles and Yates 1995a).

Late Caddoan sites are most common within the Dry Creek and Caney Creek drainages
and along Lake Fork Creek between these streams in Wood County. The settlements still
consist of small farmsteads and hamlets, but cemeteries occur consistently, usually
containing about 10 individuals. Settlements along Lake Fork seem to have occupied
only for 20 to 50 years. Reliance on agriculture (corn) appears to dominate the food base
although there was some use of deer and other animal resources. The Goldsmith site,
41WD208, located on Dry Creek consists of a house structure with an associated midden
and cemetery. Local materials were used to make tools and the ceramics were grogtempered. Although corn and beans appear to be the staple diet, nuts and other wild
plants were also used. Wild animals eaten include deer, rabbits and other wild game. Dog
burials were noted also at the Goldsmith site (Perttula, Skiles and Yates 1995b).
No historic Native-American habitation sites have been discovered in Wood County,
although no doubt Caddoan groups such the Nadaco or Anadarko were in the area.
Historic Native-American sites have been discovered in Rains County. These Norteño
focus sites were probably short-term habitation sites and were occupied while fur trading
(Duffield 1961; Duffield and Jelks 1961). Early settlers recorded visits with Indians in the
1840s and 1850 (Wood County Historical Society 1976).
Wood County was explored in 1788 by the Spaniard Pedro Vial who traveled from
Natchitoches, Louisiana to San Antonio. The first Caucasian to settle permanently in the
county was Martin Varner in 1824. Wood County was organized in 1850 when it was
separated from Van Zandt County and named after Texas governor George T. Wood who
held office from 1847 to 1849 (Wood County Historical Society 1976). Mixed feelings
abounded concerning secession from the United States among the residents of Wood
County although the county residents provided men and supplies to the Confederacy.
From 1870 to 1920, the agricultural-based economy dominated and corn and cotton were
the staple crops. The arrival of the railroad to Wood County began in the 1860s, and in
1873, the Texas & Pacific and International & Great Northern completed lines in the
southern portion of Wood County. The Missouri, Kansas & Texas (MK&T) built a line
running from Mineola to Greenville, with one of its railroad towns being Golden (Wood
County Historical Society 1976). With the arrival of the railroads and the ability to
transport large quantities of goods, manufacturing began to gain a toehold during the
period. During the Great Depression, the county’s population began to decline, but the
discovery of oil in 1941 reversed the trend. By the 1970s, the population had increased
and the county moved from the agricultural base to one that relied on beef and dairy
cattle and manufacturing. The town of Golden was established in the 1880s with the
construction of the MK&T railroad. The town was named after John C. Golden who was
the engineer in charge of that particular series of tracks (St. Clair and St. Clair 1982:398).
In the beginning, there were few plank board houses, a blacksmith shop and wells for
drinking water. As the town grew, a cotton gin and shingle mill were established, an
increased population and a diversified agricultural base.

Previous Investigations
Despite the extensive number of linear and large area surveys conducted in Wood and
Rains counties, only one recorded prehistoric campsite (41WD639) and three historic
cemeteries are located within a two-mile radius of the study area. The large linear and
area studies performed to the north and south of the study area include survey of the
Sabine Watershed in 1972 and studies along SH 69 for the TWDB. Large area studies
have been conducted 1.5 miles to the north for the Lake Fork Reservoir (Bruseth, Bagot,
Banks and McKinley 1977; Bruseth and Perttula 1981). The results of these studies have
identified sites in various topographic settings, with higher densities of sites on stream
terraces or interstream divides to major drainages.
South of the study area, AR Consultants, Inc. conducted investigations of approximately
12 miles of waterline routes for the Golden WSC (Todd 2008). No prehistoric or historic
cultural resources were recorded during these surveys of the upland areas.
Approximately 800 feet to the northeast of route W15, Pilgrims Rest Cemetery is located
on the north side of US 67. Both 41WD639 and Cottonwood Cemetery are outside the
project study area and are located in the Cottonwood Creek Watershed. This watershed
eventually drains into the Sabine River. Cottonwood Creek is mapped as perennial on the
USGS maps. Site 41WD639 is an open campsite with evidence of lithic production
activity. Due to extensive damage to the surface over 80+ years of plowing, there was no
contextual integrity to the artifacts recorded in the site, and no further investigations were
recommended (TASA 2009).
Immediately adjacent to the project route W18 and on the west side of town, the western
corner of the historic Golden Cemetery is within the ROW on the north side of FM 779.
The cemetery sits at an angle along FM 779, with the western corner 26 feet from the
edge of the road and the eastern corner being 60 feet from the road edge. Established in
the late 19th century, the oldest recorded burial is 1885 and in 1971, there were 242
recorded burials (Turner and Vickery 1971:205). In addition to the cemetery, a review of
the 1959 (photo revised 1981) Grand Saline, Golden and Calvary, Texas 7.5’ USGS maps
shows several structures adjacent to the proposed waterline routes.

RESEARCH DESIGN & METHODOLOGY
Research Design
Previous investigations within the Sabine Watershed and the Lake Fork area have
identified sites along major drainages, while linear studies in the uplands near first and
second order drainages have recorded few cultural resources. Two research questions
regarding the potential for prehistoric and historic sites have been developed regarding
this study.
The potential for prehistoric sites is low due to the location of the waterline routes in
upland settings near intermittent, first and second order drainages. In addition, these
settings are primarily along existing roadway easements, or near upland pastures that
have been plowed for 80+ years. If surface scatters are present, they have most likely
been disturbed.
There is potential for historic sites within the region, and structures are typically recorded
along transportation routes. A review of the waterline routes plotted on the 1959 Grand
Saline, Golden and Calvary, Texas 7.5’ USGS maps identified several structures near the
routes. In addition, previous investigations in the region have demonstrated that Wood
and Rains counties has been occupied since the mid-19th century by European settlers,
and there is potential for locating historic homesteads, farmsteads, or trash scatters within
the study area.
Methodology
A pedestrian archaeological survey of the waterline routes and the pump station was
conducted in November 2009. The full length of the six waterline routes were walked by
the field crew. Access for the survey was restricted to the roadway easement paralleling
the waterline routes; the roadway easement varied from 5’ to 30’ in width. In addition,
the Golden WSC requested that ARC not place shovel tests in residential yards.
Therefore, shovel testing was limited to the roadway easements along the fence lines and
within wooded areas. Shovel tests were excavated until the clay subsoil was encountered,
or to the depth of installation of the water lines (3 feet). The shovel tests were excavated
to the bottom of Holocene deposits as recommended by the Texas Historical Commission
(n.d). Shovel test matrices of sand or loam were screened through ¼” hardware cloth
screens or broken manually and inspected if the clay content is too high to allow for
effective screening.
If a prehistoric site was encountered during shovel testing, at least six additional shovel
tests would have been excavated to delineate the site’s horizontal boundaries. The same
process would have been conducted for a historic site supplemented by archival research.
Notes were taken about the surface visibility, land disturbances, drainage channels, and
vegetation. Photographs were taken along the route using a Canon Elph 2.0 mega pixel
digital camera. Shovel tests locations were recorded with a handheld Garmin GPSmap 76
receiver.

RESULTS
The results chapter is divided into three sections and opens with a discussion of the study
area. The second section provides a detailed discussion of the survey results, and
summarizes the shovel testing conducted. A detailed table of the shovel tests results is
found in Appendix A. The chapter closes with the conclusions of the cultural resources
study and presents a summary of the archaeological potential for the immediate area.
Study Area
Golden WSC has proposed the installation of six sections (W15-W20) of new waterlines
to parallel the county and Farm to Market roads within, and surrounding, the town of
Golden (Figure 2). These lines are primarily to be installed within 15 feet of existing
utility or roadway easements; the routes cross through residential yards, pastures and
occasionally wooded areas. Ground visibility in the mowed yards was between 30 and 50
percent, while it varied in the pastures from 20 to 70 percent. In the wooded stretches
between residences, ground visibility was less than 30 percent. The pedestrian survey was
conducted from the roadway easements, and shovel testing was conducted in areas where
ground visibility was low and access was not restricted.
During the week preceding the survey, Wood County, and much of north Central Texas,
had received over 5 inches of rain, and the ground was saturated. The Sabine River was
out of its banks, and many of the intermittent tributaries that were within or near Golden
had moving water in them. Vegetation was primarily short grasses in the residential
properties, recently mowed hay in the pastures, and tall stands of pine, pecan, cottonwood
and a variety of oaks in the wooded areas.
The Survey
Section W15 is proposed to run along the north side of CR 2375 and is approximately 1.3
miles long. The survey was conducted from west to east and crossed through relatively
level pastures, residential yards, and eventually crosses the intermittent tributary of
Lankford Creek (Figure 3). A small knoll is to the north in the western half of the route,
ground exposure was very good, and although small hematite and sandstone gravels were
found, no knappable gravels were present. Three shovel tests were placed close to the
centerline of the proposed waterline on this section (ST1-3). ST1 was excavated at the
edge of a pasture near a cattle pen. The topsoil was brown sandy loam and was mottled
with clay to 89 cmbs. The shovel test filled with water at this stage and was terminated.
The second shovel test, ST2, was excavated in the ROW adjacent to an abandoned
garage. The topsoil was brown sandy loam with pea sized hematite gravels, followed by a
mottled horizon of clay and sandy loam, then yellowish red clay was encountered at 60
cmbs. ST3 was placed on the east side of Lankford Creek at the upland edge, the ground
on the west side of the drainage was relatively low, and had standing water present.
Topsoil and a mottled zone were similar to ST2, and the shovel tests filled with water at
50 cmbs. No cultural material was recorded on the surface or in the shovel tests along this
section of the waterline.

Front lawns lined the majority of section W15 along CR 2375, view is to
the west.

Section W16 is approximately 0.8 miles in length, runs north south, and parallels the west
side of CR 2385. At the north end, the road crosses an unnamed, intermittent tributary.
The majority of the route crosses level uplands. Standing water was present near the
tributary, but one shovel test (ST4) was excavated in the wooded area slightly south of
the tributary. Brown sandy loam was in the top 45 cm, followed by strong brown clay. As
the route continued south, it crossed pastures, several front yards, and the headwater of a
second unnamed, intermittent tributary. Multiple cable markers were on the edge of the
utility easements and private properties. One structure was shown along CR 2385 on the
1959 Golden, Texas 7.5’ USGS map near the route, but it is approximately 100’ from the
road, therefore it is out of the waterline study corridor. The second shovel test (ST5) was
placed adjacent to a pasture in the roadway easement where ground visibility was less
than 30 percent (Figure 4). Brown sandy loam topsoil was followed by yellowish brown
sandy loam, then red sandy clay to a depth of 62 cmbs. The final two shovel tests, ST6
and ST7, were near the south end of the route with sandy loam topsoil and sandy clay at
54 and 65 cmbs respectively.

Figure 4. A view of Section W16 waterline ROW (follows the fence line) facing north.
Section W17, approximately 0.32 miles long, will run through the town of Golden, and
begin on the south side of town just north of the intersection of FM 1799 and CR 2920.
This is also the location of the existing 0.47-acre pump station site (Figure 5), where
additional improvements are proposed. The route continues north along the west side of
CR 2921 through existing utility easements that are on the edge of residential properties
(Figure 6) and crosses under FM 779. Section W18 begins from Section W17 just after it
crosses FM 779. Section W17 continues to the northeast and crosses under a small
oil/sand road before turning southeast approximate 60 feet in front of a historic house
(Figure 7). The line turns again to the northeast and crosses under another oil/sand road
and winding southeast to end at a line in the northwest corner of the right-of-way of the
intersection of FM 1799 and FM 779. Several of the structures shown on the USGS map
are still standing, but are out of the proposed waterline ROW. No shovel tests were
placed within this route or at the location for the improvements for the pump station due
to the excellent ground visibility in the mowed yards.
Section W18 is approximately 0.42 miles in length runs along FM 779 through the town
of Golden. In the town center, it jogs northwest, then continues due west. The route is
centered in existing utility easements. One shovel test (ST8) was placed near the west end
of the waterline route. Strong brown sandy loam topsoil was followed by reddish yellow
sandy loam at 18 cm, then red sandy clay at 26 cmbs. No cultural material was identified
within the route or in the shovel test.

To the west, a mobile home is at the location where a structure shown on the USGS map
once stood. The route then passes in front of the Golden Cemetery, and this section of the
route will be bored at a minimum of 10 feet below the surface with the bore points at
least 30 feet back from the fenced cemetery boundaries (Figures 8 and 9). The parking lot
in front of the cemetery along FM 779 is between 18 inches to 2 feet lower that the
original ground surface of the cemetery. The 10 foot depth of the bore will actually be
11.5 to 13 feet below the cemetery’s original surface as agreed upon with the THC,
which should be deep enough to avoid any unmarked burials if they should exist.
Section W19 is 1.6 miles long and travels on the north side of FM 779 from FM 17 west
into Rains County. The route crosses through rolling uplands and the headwaters of two
unnamed intermittent drainages. The roadway easement was relatively wide and portions
of the route stayed in the easement instead of on the private property side of the fences.
The road easement had a distinct slope from the road to the drainage ditch, and then a
steep slope of 15 to 30 feet until it leveled out near the private property fences. From east
to west, ten shovel tests (ST9-ST18) were placed in level areas with poor ground
visibility along the proposed waterline route. A house is shown on the northwest corner
of the intersection on the 1959 Golden, Texas 7.5’ USGS map, yet it is over 100 feet
from the waterline ROW (Figure 10).

Near the intersection of FM 17, ST9 was placed at the edge of a wooded area. The first 8
cm were mottled clay, most likely from the road construction, followed by dark yellowish
brown sandy loam, yellowish brown sandy loam, and then was terminated at 46 cmbs
where dark yellowish brown clay mottled with sandy loam. The waterline route then
crosses through four yards and along the front of private property where several mobile
homes were present. The first drainage encountered ran through a heavily wooded area,
and two shovel tests were placed on the upland edges of the drainage.

Figure 10.

Residence, which appears on the 1959, Golden, TX 7.5’ USGS map is
north of the proposed ROW and will not be impacted by the installation of
the waterlines.

On the east side, ST10-ST11 had similar sandy loam topsoil and encountered dark
yellowish brown and strong brown clay at 50 and 34 cm respectively. West of the
drainage, the topsoil was much shallower in ST12 and ST13, most likely due to erosion,
and clay subsoil was encountered at 26 and 28 respectively. A sixth shovel test (ST14)
was placed on the west side of the drainage at a high point. Yellowish red sandy clay was
encountered at 28 cmbs. As the route continued west, several more front yards were
crossed, and then the second drainage was encountered. Four additional shovel tests
(ST15-ST18) were placed on the upland edges near the drainage valley before the slope
became too pronounced. On the east side of the drainage, the topsoil was shallow, most
likely due to erosion, and yellowish red clay subsoil was encountered between 22 and 29
cmbs. On the west side of the drainage, the clay subsoil was slightly deeper and was
encountered at 42 cmbs in ST17. The following shovel tests (ST18) had mottled sandy
loam with clay to a depth of 65 cmbs, but began to fill with water at 50 cmbs. The route

terminated into private property, in a valley where groundwater was standing in the
easements. No cultural materials were recorded on the surface or in the shovel tests.
The final section, W20, is 0.9 miles long and will be on the east side of CR 2958. The
majority of this section crosses through front yards that abut the mowed utility easement.
An unnamed tributary to Cottonwood Creek is crossed, and two shovel tests (ST19ST20) were placed on the upland edges to the north and south. Strong brown clay was
encountered between 28 and 43 cmbs, and the topsoil was dark brown or brown sandy
loam. The drainage slope was gentle and dissected by erosional gullies on the south side,
while it was more pronounced on the north bank (Figure 11). Clay and sandstone bedrock
were on the surface near the bottom of the creek valley, and a culvert was installed under
the roadway. The final shovel test (ST21) was placed in a wooded area near the north end
of the route. The soils were similar to the previous two shovel tests, and the results for the
survey for this section were negative for cultural materials.

Conclusions
No new prehistoric or historic resources were recorded during the intensive survey. The
lack of prehistoric resources within the waterlines routes is attributed to several factors.
The routes are most likely too far up in the headwaters, and most of the recorded sites in
the region are along larger, more permanent drainages such as Cottonwood Creek and the
Sabine River.
The lack of historic resources within the waterline routes is attributed to the proximity of
the centerline to the roadways. There are historic houses in the region, but many of them
are at least 100 feet from the road edge. Golden Cemetery is the only resource near the
waterline route, and boring will prevent any disturbance of this historic cemetery. The
frequently flooded area would have been difficult to traverse even in historic times before
the arrival of paved roads or the railroads, and historic accounts from early settlers
document the need to ford streams regularly around Golden during wet weather (Wood
County Historical Society 1976:7).

RECOMMENDATIONS
The results of the survey have demonstrated that the archaeological potential for
prehistoric and historic sites is low within the majority of the proposed Golden WSC
waterline routes. The exception is section W18, which passes in front of the Golden
Cemetery on FM 779. However, this portion of the waterline will be bored at a minimum
of 10 feet below the surface, and start and end 30 feet beyond the fenced cemetery
boundaries along the right of way to avoid disturbing any potentially unmarked burials.
AR Consultants, Inc. does not recommend any further investigations within these routes.
Based on these recommendations, we suggest that construction can proceed for the
installation of the waterlines. We further recommend that if cultural resources are
uncovered during construction that work should cease in that area and the Archeology
Division of the Texas Historical Commission should be notified.
