MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Magellan Pipeline Company, L.P. (Magellan), the contract operator of the Longhorn
Partners Pipeline, L.P. (Longhorn Pipeline), is in the process of conducting maintenance
activities at 21 locations along the existing Longhorn Pipeline right-of-way (ROW) within Travis,
Bastrop, and Fayette counties, Texas. The maintenance activities consist of the repair of
portions of the pipeline due to the presence of anomalies at each of the 21 locations. To
conduct the repairs, the pipeline must be unearthed and subsequently encircled with a metal
sleeve or similar repair device. All excavation will be restricted to the existing ROW and will be
confined to areas previously disturbed by the original pipeline construction and intervening
pipeline and ROW maintenance. Each of the 21 maintenance locations are located on private
lands and do not require federal funding, licensure, permitting, or approval. At the request of
Magellan, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted an intensive cultural
resources survey of the 21 maintenance locations toward the end of October 2006. The
purpose of the survey was to determine if any cultural resources were located at these areas,
and, if so, to determine their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP).
The cultural resources survey resulted in the documentation of cultural materials
associated with a formal archeological site at only 1 smart pig dig (SPD) maintenance location
(SPD 10/06 - 11). The ROW at this location traverses site 41BP299, a multi-component site
consisting of an aboriginal open campsite, historic military debris associated with Camp Swift,
and the Claiborne Cemetery. During the assessment of location SPD 10/06 -11, chert flaking
debris was observed on the surface within previously disturbed areas of the ROW. No historicage materials were observed, and the Claiborne Cemetery is located a considerable distance to
the south, outside of the ROW. The assessment of this location revealed that prior impacts to
the site deposits within the existing ROW have been considerable, including the initial
construction of the pipeline as well as the more recent construction of a valve station associated
with an adjacent pipeline. While the areas of site 41BP299 located outside of the existing ROW
may contain potentially significant cultural deposits, the degree of disturbance within the current
ROW suggests that the cultural deposits within the ROW lack any integrity. Because of this, it is
Horizon’s professional opinion that the deposits of site 41BP299 within the existing ROW do not
contribute to the overall NRHP eligibility status of the site, and that no further investigations
within the ROW at this location are warranted.

Management Summary

The cultural resources survey of the remaining 20 maintenance locations resulted in
essentially negative findings at all 20 of the locations. While 1 tertiary flake was observed at
SPD 10/06 - 24, no other cultural materials were observed on the surface or within the
excavated shovel tests. As such, the solitary chert flake was considered to be an isolated
occurrence and was not recorded as a site. Similarly, a sparse scatter of surficial historic debris
observed near SPD 10/06 - 25 was assessed as being slope wash material in a secondary
context that had eroded downslope from a historic homestead located outside of the ROW on
private property. As the actual historic homestead is situated outside of the ROW on private
property, it also was not recorded as a site. No prehistoric or historic-age cultural materials
constituting actual intact archeological sites were observed at any of the 20 remaining locations.
If any cultural materials had been present, they would have been confined to surface contexts
by the exposed limestone bedrock or shallow, gravelly clay deposits prevalent along the ROW.
No areas containing any potential for deeply buried, stratified cultural deposits were observed at
any of the 20 assessed locations. Based on the negative results of the cultural resources
survey at these 20 locations, as well as the low potential for deeply buried, stratified cultural
deposits, it is Horizon’s professional opinion that the maintenance activities at the remaining 20
locations will have no potential for impact on significant cultural resources, nor historic
properties listed in or eligible for the NRHP, and that no further investigations are warranted.

Cultural Resources Assessments of 21 Maintenance Locations along the Longhorn Partners Pipeline

1.0 INTRODUCTION

Magellan Pipeline Company, L.P. (Magellan), the contract operator of the Longhorn
Partners Pipeline, L.P. (Longhorn Pipeline), is in the process of conducting maintenance
activities at 21 locations along the existing Longhorn Pipeline right-of-way (ROW) within Travis,
Bastrop, and Fayette counties, Texas. The sections of the pipeline containing the 21
maintenance locations were internally inspected in August 2006 as an integrity verification
measure intended to meet the requirements of Part 195.452, Pipeline Integrity Management.
The results of the inspection indicated the presence of certain pipeline anomalies that require
repair. To conduct the repairs, the pipeline must be unearthed and subsequently encircled with
a metal repair sleeve or similar repair device. All excavation will be restricted to the existing
ROW and confined to areas previously disturbed by original pipeline construction and
intervening pipeline and ROW maintenance. After the pipeline repairs are completed, the area
will be returned to its original condition. All 21 maintenance locations are located on private
lands and do not require federal funding, licensure, permitting, or approval. Magellan
contracted with Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) to conduct an intensive cultural
resources survey of the 21 maintenance locations. The purpose of the survey was to determine
if any cultural resources were located at these areas, and, if so, to determine their eligibility for
inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
The cultural resources investigations consisted of an archival review, an intensive
pedestrian survey of each of the 21 maintenance locations, and the production of a report
suitable for review by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the
Texas Historical Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27,
and the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management
Reports. Russell Brownlow (Horizon’s cultural resources director) served as the Principal
Investigator for the project. Ron Ralph (archeological sub-consultant) conducted the field
investigations on 26, 27, and 31 of October 2006.
In all, the assessed locations total approximately 27 acres, including areas visually
assessed while traveling along the ROW from points of access toward the maintenance
locations. This equates to approximately 23,692 feet (ft) (7,226.1 meters [m]) of overall ROW
length with a width of 50 feet (15.3 m). Due to the number of locations over an extensive length
of pipeline ROW, the location, description, and results of the investigations at each maintenance
location are presented together in Section 4 of this report following the presentation of the

2.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The archeological record of Central Texas spans the known cultural-historical sequence:
PaleoIndian, 9200 to 6000 BC; Archaic, 6000 BC to AD 800; Late Prehistoric, AD 800 to 1600;
and Historic, 1600 to 1870.

2.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (CA. 9200 TO 6000 BC)

The PaleoIndian period is believed to be the earliest cultural occupation in the Central
Texas region. This stage is characterized typologically by the occurrence of distinctive
lanceolate projectile points and highly mobile settlement and exploitation patterns. These
populations probably practiced a foraging (i.e., hunting and gathering) type of subsistence (Weir
1976; Prewitt 1981), although the best known sites exhibit a focus on the exploitation of large
mammals, including Mammuthus sp. and Bison antiquus. Investigations at sites such as the
Kincaid Rockshelter, Wilson-Leonard, and Gault have shown that during the early part of the
PaleoIndian, the Clovis stage, subsistence included large herbivores (e.g., mammoth, bison,
and horse), as well as smaller animals such as water turtles, badgers, and raccoons. A
multitude of plants are presumed to have also been an important part of the aboriginal diet.
However, during the later part of the PaleoIndian period, the Folsom stage, subsistence seems
to have depended more heavily on the specialized hunting of big game, particularly bison. This
presumption is based on the fact that only camps, stone-working, and kill sites, mostly in or near
grassland habitats, are all that have been documented (Collins 1995:382). This change was
most likely attributable to the climate, which had become warmer and drier than the previous
Clovis stage.

2.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 6000 BC TO AD 800)

The beginning of the Archaic period in Texas represents a similar transition found worldwide at approximately the same time, the most noted indicators being the extinction of
Pleistocene megafauna and climatic changes. In Texas, there was a gradual decrease in
moisture and humidity reflecting the intensification of warming and drying trends first noted
during the Clovis-Folsom transition. An often-quoted response to these climatic changes was a
greater and more varied use of local resources; in actuality, this was already the case in most
places. Plant-processing implements such as manos and metates and earth ovens become
more evident in the archeological record, while the hunting of game continued. Although still
nomadic, Archaic people restricted their travel to smaller areas than did the PaleoIndian groups.

Chapter 2.0: Cultural Background

The Archaic period, which covers 2/3 of Central Texas prehistory (Collins 1995), is
divided into 3 subperiods: Early (6000 to 3000 BC), Middle (3000 to 1000 BC), and Late (1000
BC to AD 800) (Hester 1986). Each period is represented by specific point styles. The Early
Archaic, the least understood period, is distinguished by the switch from PaleoIndian lanceolateshaped points to notched and stemmed points. Overall, the Early Archaic patterns in Texas are
fairly similar throughout the state. Hester (1989) wrote that, prior to 3000 BC, the late Holocene
hunters and foragers were essentially indistinguishable in terms of subsistence strategies
across Region 3, which includes the Central Texas Plateau Prairie, South Texas Plains, and
Lower Pecos Canyon lands. After this date, regionally distinctive projectile points emerge.
Hughes (1991) also noted similarities when he wrote that the Early Archaic typological
developments on the Texas High Plains resembled developments in Central and Southwestern
Texas, as well as in other bordering regions.
Although settlement patterns for the Early Archaic are little known, it is assumed that the
population density was low and organized into small bands practicing a mobile, generalized
subsistence and settlement pattern. The wide distribution of artifacts suggests mobility was
high and territories relatively undefined. McKinney (1981), among others, has noted that
distribution of Early Archaic sites was apparently concentrated along the Balcones Escarpment.
This phenomenon may possibly reflect the greater availability of water resources along this
feature during an arid, climatic interval (Hester 1989).
Sites containing Early Archaic components are open camp sites such as Loeve, WilsonLeonard, Richard Beene, Sleeper, Landslide, Granberg II, Jetta Court, and a cave, Hall’s Cave.
Lithic materials found within these components include grinding implements, hammerstones,
projectile points, a variety of unifacial and bifacial chipped stone instruments, and Clear Fork
and Guadalupe bifaces. The Clear Fork tools, although indicative primarily of the Early Archaic,
actually appeared in the Late PaleoIndian period and, in some regions, lingered into Late
Archaic and Late Prehistoric times (Hughes 1991).
The Middle Archaic is marked by an increased number of sites, which may reflect an
expanding population distribution, the development of regionally distinct cultural patterns, and
changes in settlement, technology, social systems, and territorial boundaries (Black and
McGraw 1985:38). Hester (1986) suggests that during this period, the inhabitants of the
Balcones Escarpment region developed specialized adaptations to the hunting and gathering of
abundant regional resources, particularly acorns and white-tailed deer.
Site types include open campsites located near streams or tributaries, lithic workshops in
the upland areas, and special activity sites such as hunting camps or food-processing stations
(Black and McGraw 1985). Large, burned rock features (hearths as well as rock ovens) of the
early part of the Middle Archaic give way in the later Middle Archaic to burned rock middens
(Collins 1995). These latter features have been interpreted as representing several different
subsistence practices. For example, Hester (1986) proposed that they represented intensive
utilization of acorns, while Johnson and Goode (1994:26) suggested that they were more
frequently being used to cook xerophytes such as sotol. Middle Archaic projectile points include
the Nolan, Travis, Langtry, and Pedernales (Black 1989); the latter of which is considered by
Hester (1986) to be diagnostic of this time period in the Balcones Escarpment region.

Cultural Resources Assessments of 21 Maintenance Locations along the Longhorn Partners Pipeline

The Late Archaic is represented by a continuation, and possibly intensification, of the
subsistence patterns seen in the Middle Archaic (Hester 1986; Collins 1995). The use of burned
rock midden sites continued throughout the Middle Archaic, peaking during the latter part of this
period (Collins 1995).
Large cemetery sites are first noted during the Late Archaic and may reflect the
establishment of territories and subsistence schedules (Story 1985:49; Black 1989:30; Black
and McGraw 1985). Hester (1986) suggests the development of wide-ranging trade contacts
may have also occurred around this time. Characteristic projectile points include triangular types
such as Montell, Castroville, and Marcos, along with the smaller, expanding stem points such as
Ensor, Frio, Darl, and Fairland.

2.3

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. AD 800 TO 1600)

The Late Prehistoric period is separated from the preceding Archaic by the introduction
of the bow and arrow and ceramics. Two phases are recognized within this period: the Austin
(ca AD 800 to 1300) and Toyah (ca AD 1300 to 1600). The Austin phase is characterized by
the transition from the use of the atlatl and dart to that of the bow and arrow and arrow points,
particularly the expanding, stemmed Scallorn type. This phase is also distinguished by a
decline in population and changes in settlement practices, in which there was a shift from open
to protected (rockshelter) sites (Black 1989:32; Collins 1995:385). In spite of these changes,
most archeologists agree that Late Archaic subsistence practices and settlement patterns
appear to have continued during the Austin phase (Prewitt 1974; Black 1989; Collins 1995).
The Toyah phase is characterized by relatively rapid changes in technology, notably
pottery (both local and imported from the Caddo area); large, thin bifaces; Perdiz (contracting
stem) arrow points; and prismatic blades (Black 1989; Collins 1995). Limited agriculture may
also have begun during this time. The Toyah tool kit was associated with the hunting of bison,
deer, and antelope, and, although nearly all sites dating to this phase have yielded bison bones,
deer was the most significant faunal resource during this time (Black 1989:32). Evidence for
agriculture is seen in the occasional corn cob found at sites such as the Timmeron Rockshelter
in Hays County. Of course, the corn could also be attributed to the same trade network that
was bringing in the Caddoan pottery.

2.4

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. AD 1600 TO PRESENT)

The Historic period, which began with the arrival of Europeans into the region, can be
divided into 3 subperiods: early, middle, and late. Only a brief overview of the period is given
here. For a more detailed essay, see Newcomb 1993:1-63.
The first documented arrival of Europeans into Central Texas dates to the early 18th
century (Newcomb 1993). Their influence, however, preceded their arrival. In the late 17th
century, natives from northern Mexico and southern Texas began migrating into Central Texas
to escape forced occupation and labor in the Spanish mines, missions, and on Spanish
ranches. At approximately the same time, horses stolen from the Spanish had become an
integral part of the Apache way of life. These mounted, nomadic bison hunters of the High

Chapter 2.0: Cultural Background

Plains enjoyed a tremendous advantage over their pedestrian enemies. They terrorized native
groups to the east and southeast of their High Plains homeland, forcing many to flee, some into
Central Texas (Newcomb 1993:2). Thus, the first Europeans into the region encountered native
groups fragmented by the growth of the Spanish missions, the raids of the Apache, and the
diseases that swept before the physical presence of Europeans. Their accounts, therefore, do
not provide direct analogs to prehistoric lifeway patterns, but rather represent a time of drastic
cultural change (Collins 1995). A few indigenous cultural patterns may have prevailed through
time. Along with large, diffuse encampments composed of peoples with mixed ethnic
affiliations, small band-sized residential camps, both dating to this particular period, are found in
Central Texas (Collins 1995:386). These latter sites may represent indigenous groups.
The middle Historic subperiod began about 1730 and ended about 1800 as the mission
system was failing (Hester 1989; Collins 1995:386). Historic documents of this period make
reference to remnants of native groups living in the missions, primarily in Bexar County (Collins
1995). Toward the end of this subperiod, the Comanche began to move into Northwestern
Texas from the high plains. Records of their presence in Central Texas at this time tend to be
highly biased since they are provided mostly from the hostile perspective of Anglo settlers
(Collins 1995).
The late Historic subperiod is composed of small numbers of mission Indians, “far flung
nomadic native groups (primarily the Comanche),” and an archeological record of the European
presence (Collins 1995:387). The Comanche presence began fading in the mid- to late 19th
century. Their final demise heralded the end of Native American presence in Central Texas.

3.0 GENERAL METHODOLOGY

Prior to the field effort, Horizon conducted archival research via the Internet at the THC’s
Texas Archeological Sites Atlas web site in order to determine if any previously recorded
archeological sites were documented within the vicinity of each of the maintenance locations,
and if any previous cultural resources assessments had been conducted near each location.
The results of the archival research are presented in the following section in association with
each of the maintenance locations.
Following the archival review, a Horizon archeologist completed an intensive pedestrian
survey of the 21 maintenance locations on 26, 27, and 31 October 2006. In general, this
included both intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing at each maintenance
location. However, in areas where shallow clay soils or exposed bedrock were present, shovel
testing was not conducted. As each location typically consisted of only a small area of impact
(generally 15 feet in length [4.6 m]), 1 to 2 shovel tests were deemed substantial enough to
assess the deposits at each location. The Texas State Minimum Survey Standards require a
minimum of 3 shovel tests per acre for projects less than 2 acres in size. As each location
amounted to considerably less than even a 1/4 acre, the 1 to 2 shovel tests at each
maintenance location exceeded the Texas State Minimum Survey Standards. Due to recent
rains prior to the field endeavor, screening of the wet excavated matrix was essentially
impossible in most cases. As such, all excavated matrices were trowel-sorted to determine if
cultural materials were present. The locations of all excavated shovel tests are presented in the
following section.
In addition to the assessment of each maintenance location, the Horizon archeologist
also visually assessed the surface of the existing ROW while en route to each of the locations.
Although no shovel tests were conducted along the areas traveled en route to the maintenance
locations, the ROW surfaces were visually assessed in order to determine if surface cultural
deposits were present or if subsurface deposits that had been unearthed during the initial
construction of the pipeline were exposed. The extents of the visually assessed areas are
presented in the following section.
During the field investigations, field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils,
land forms, shovel tests, cultural material observed (if any), etc. If any new archeological sites
were encountered, standardized site forms were to be completed and submitted to the Texas

Chapter 3.0: General Methodology

Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) for permanent housing. Similarly, “re-visit” forms
were to be completed for any previously recorded sites encountered during the investigations.
Standardized shovel tests forms were completed for each excavated shovel test, and digital
photographs with a photo log were also completed as appropriate. The location of each
maintenance location and shovel test was recorded via handheld GPS units utilizing the UTM
coordinate system and the NAD 27 map datum. The locations are presented in the following

Cultural Resources Assessments of 21 Maintenance Locations along the Longhorn Partners Pipeline

4.0 MAINTENANCE LOCATIONS

The 21 maintenance locations are found along the length of the existing Longhorn
Pipeline ROW in Travis, Bastrop, and Fayette counties. However, many of the locations are
grouped together or are situated only short distances from one another along the ROW.
Because the area environment and the results of the archival reviews conducted for each
location tend to be similar for those locations situated adjacent to or near each other, the results
of the background data gathering and field investigations are presented below in relation to
general groupings of the 21 maintenance locations.

4.1

SPD 10/06 - 1, 2, AND 3

These 3 maintenance locations, smart pig digs (SPD) 10/06 - 1, 2, and 3, are in Fayette
County west of the Warda Pump Station (Figure 1). The maintenance activity at each of the 3
locations consists of the excavation of a short section of the pipeline within the confines of the
previously disturbed ROW and the repair of the anomaly present at each.
4.1.1

Area Environment

Location SPD 10/06 - 1 consists of a cleared, open pasture on a hilltop (Figure 2). Soils
at this location are mapped as Arol fine sandy loam (ArA). The Arol series consists of
moderately deep, moderately well-drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed from weakly
consolidated clayey tuff (NRCS 2006). These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping plane or
slightly concave uplands. The surface layer, about 6 inches (15.2 centimeters [cm]) thick, is fine
sandy loam. The subsoil is clay that extends to a depth of 30 inches (7.6 cm). The next layer,
to a depth of 45 inches (11.3 cm), is weakly cemented clayey tuff.
Location SPD 10/06 - 2 is a ridge top with Piney woods flanking the ROW (Figure 3).
Soils at this location were also mapped as Arol fine sandy loam (ArA).
Location SPD 10/06 - 3 is a hilltop with a surface exposure consisting of a sandy mantle
and lag gravels (Figure 4). Soils at this location are mapped as Gredge fine sandy loam (Grb).
The Gredge series consists of very deep, well-drained, very slowly permeable soils on erosional
Pleistocene terraces (NRCS 2006). The soil formed in loamy and clayey sediments. The surface
layer, about 7 inches (17.5 cm) thick, is fine sandy loam. The subsoil is clay that extends to a
depth of 21 inches (52.5 cm). The next layer, to a depth of 57 inches (142.5 cm), is clay loam.

Archival Review

A review of the THC’s Atlas database indicated the presence of 2 previously recorded
sites (41FY499 and 41FY508) within 0.5 miles (0.8 kilometers [km]) of SPD 10/06 -1 and 2, and
2 previously recorded sites (41FY495 and 41FY496) within 0.5 miles (0.8 km) of SPD 10/06 - 3.
Sites 41FY495 and 41FY499 were recorded as aboriginal lithic procurement locales, while
41FY496 was recorded as an aboriginal lithic scatter. None of these 3 sites were considered
eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. The fourth site, 41FY508, was documented as an aboriginal
open campsite with materials dating from the Late Archaic to the Late Prehistoric periods. Its
NRHP eligibility status was not provided on the site form. None of these 4 sites are located in
the immediate vicinity of any of the 3 maintenance locations. According to the Atlas, no formal
cultural resources surveys have been conducted at any of these 3 maintenance locations.
4.1.3

Assessment Conducted

During the field assessment of locations SPD 10/06 - 1, 2, and 3, the archeologist
excavated a total of 2 shovel tests at each maintenance location. Table 1 below presents the
resulting shovel test data. In addition, the archeologist also conducted surface inspection along
the ROW from the point of ROW access up to each of the 3 maintenance locations. These
visually assessed areas, along with the shovel test locations, are presented in Figure 1.

Cultural Resources Assessments of 21 Maintenance Locations along the Longhorn Partners Pipeline

4.1.4

Results

The surface inspection and shovel tests conducted at locations SPD 10/06 - 1, 2, and 3
produced entirely negative results. No cultural materials were observed on the surface of any of
the 3 locations or within any of the shovel tests excavated at each location.
4.1.5

Recommendations

Based on the negative results of the cultural resources assessments at locations SPD
10/06 - 1, 2, and 3, it is Horizon’s professional opinion that no significant cultural resources will
be impacted by the maintenance activities at these locations and that no further cultural
resources investigations are warranted. Horizon recommends that cultural resources clearance
be granted for these 3 locations.

4.2

SPD 10/06 - 5 AND 6

These 2 maintenance locations, SPD 10/06 - 5 and 6, are in Bastrop County east of
Farm to Market Road (FM) 2104 (Figure 5).
The maintenance activity at each of the 2
locations consists of the excavation of a short section of the pipeline within the confines of the
previously disturbed ROW and the repair of the anomaly present at each.
4.2.1

Area Environment

Location SPD 10/06 - 5 consists of an anomaly that was detected under an existing
roadbed (Figure 6). This location was heavily disturbed from the roadway construction as well
as the installation of an adjacent water line. Axtell-Tabor Complex (AtD) soils are mapped at
this location. The Axtell soils have a surface layer of gravelly sandy loam about 14 inches (35.0
cm) thick with 40 percent siliceous pebbles in their lower parts. The subsoil is mottled clay that
extends to a depth of 28 inches (70.0 cm). The next layer, to a depth of 60 inches (150.0 cm),
is mottled sandy clay. The Tabor soils have a surface layer of gravelly fine sandy loam about
18 inches (45.0 cm) thick with 40 percent siliceous pebbles in their lower parts. The subsoil, to
a depth of 40 inches (100.0 cm), is mottled clay (NRCS 2006).
Location SPD 10/06 - 6 is a hill slope that is primarily open pasture with scattered live
oak and juniper trees (Figure 7). Mapped soils at this location consist of Vernia very gravelly
loamy sand (VeD). This gently sloping to sloping soil is on uplands. A few areas have been
stripped for sand and gravel (NRCS 2006).
4.2.2

Archival Review

A review of the THC’s Atlas database indicated no previously recorded sites within 0.5
miles (0.8 km) of SPD 10/06 - 5 and 6. According to the Atlas, no formal cultural resources
surveys have been conducted at these 2 maintenance locations.

4.2.3

Assessment Conducted

At the time of the assessment of SPD 10/06 -5, the repair of the anomaly, which was
beneath the existing roadbed, had already been completed since the exact area was under
construction due to adjacent pipeline construction activities from another pipeline operator. Due
to the highly disturbed nature of the location from the roadway and pipeline construction, a
formal assessment was deemed to be unnecessary. As such, only a visual inspection of the
disturbed surface was conducted.
During the field assessment of location SPD 10/06 - 6, the archeologist excavated a total
of 2 shovel tests at the maintenance location. Table 2 below presents the resulting shovel test
data. In addition, the archeologist also conducted surface inspection along the ROW from the
point of ROW access up to each of the maintenance locations. This visually assessed area,
along with the shovel test locations, is presented in Figure 5.
4.2.4

Results

The investigations conducted at locations SPD 10/06 - 5 and 6 produced entirely
negative results. No cultural materials were observed on the surface of either of these 2
locations or within any of the excavated shovel tests.

4.3

SPD 10/06 - 11 AND 12

Maintenance locations SPD 10/06 - 11 and 12 are found in Bastrop County,
approximately 4 miles (6.4 km) west of Buescher State Park (Figure 8).
The maintenance
activity at each of the 2 locations consists of the excavation of a short section of the pipeline
within the confines of the previously disturbed ROW and the repair of the anomaly present at
each.
4.3.1

Area Environment

Location SPD 10/06 - 11 is situated on an upland toe-slope that protrudes into the
floodplain of the Colorado River (Figure 9). The areas bordering the ROW are generally
wooded with live oak, post oak, and juniper. Lag gravels are prevalent across the surface of the
ROW, which has been heavily disturbed by the construction of a ConocoPhillips valve station.
Mapped soils are mapped as the Axtell-Tabor Complex (AtD), which has been previously
described earlier in the text.
Location SPD 10/06 - 12 is situated in a bottomland area of the Colorado River
floodplain (Figure 10). This low-lying area had standing water during the time of the
assessment. Mapped soils at this location consist of Ships silty clay (Sp). This nearly level soil
is found on bottomlands. Most of the areas are protected by dams, and they are seldom subject
to flooding (NRCS 2006).

Archival Review

A review of the THC’s Atlas database indicated the presence of 1 previously recorded
site (41BP299) within 0.5 miles (0.8 km) of SPD 10/06 - 11 and 12. Site 41BP299 was originally
documented in 1984 during the Bastrop County Cemetery Survey. It is described as an
aboriginal open campsite with diagnostic artifacts suggested Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric
deposits, as well as a historic cemetery (Claiborne Cemetery). A follow-up visit to the site by
Turpin and Sons, Inc. (TAS) during monitoring investigations documented additional historic
artifacts suggestive of military usage in the early 20th century associated with nearby Camp
Swift. TAS noted that the observed military artifacts were collected from spoil piles and trench
walls during monitoring investigations for the pipeline. Although the location has been assessed
twice, the Atlas does not reflect any previous surveys at this location.
Site 41BP299 actually encompasses the landform containing SPD 10/06 - 11 (see
Figure 8). SPD 10/06 - 12 is located a minimum of 1000 feet (305.0 m) west of the site.
4.3.3

Assessment Conducted

During the field assessment of locations SPD 10/06 - 11 and 12, the archeologist
excavated a total of 2 shovel tests at each maintenance location. Table 3 presents the resulting
shovel test data. In addition, the archeologist also conducted surface inspection along the ROW

Results

Regarding location SPD 10/06 - 11, both shovel tests at this location produced negative
results. Chert flakes were observed on the surface of the ROW at this location and are
undoubtedly associated with the aboriginal occupations comprising a portion of site 41BP299.
However, the area was clearly heavily disturbed by previous pipeline and adjacent valve station
construction, and all observed flakes were believed to be out of context in the disturbed soils.
No evidence of the historic military component of the site was observed. The historic Claiborne
Cemetery, which is included as part of site 41BP299, is located outside of the ROW,
approximately 300 feet (91.5 m) to the south.
Both shovel tests and the visual assessment of the ROW conducted for SPD 10/06 - 12
produced entirely negative results. No cultural materials were observed on the surface at this
location or within any of the excavated shovel tests.
4.3.5

Recommendations

Maintenance location SPD 10/06 - 11 is situated within the boundaries of site 41BP299.
Both of the earlier assessments of the site indicated that that it had potential for formal
designation as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL) and that it should be protected and
avoided. However, within the existing ROW that traverses the site, prior impacts have been

HJN 050175 AR

Chapter 4.0: Maintenance Locations

considerable, including the initial construction of the pipeline as well as the more recent
construction of a valve station associated with an adjacent pipeline. While the areas of site
41BP299 located outside of the existing ROW may actually contain potentially significant
cultural deposits, the degree of disturbance within the current ROW suggests that the cultural
deposits within the ROW lack integrity. Because of this, it is Horizon’s professional opinion that
the deposits of site 41BP299 within the existing ROW do not contribute to the overall eligibility
status of the site, and that no further investigations within the ROW at this location are
warranted. Horizon recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted for the
maintenance activities at location SPD 10/06 - 11.
Based on the negative results of the cultural resources assessments at location SPD
10/06 - 12, it is Horizon’s professional opinion that no significant cultural resources will be
impacted by the maintenance activities at this location and that no further cultural resources
investigations are warranted. Horizon recommends that cultural resources clearance be
granted for location SPD 10/06 - 12.

4.4

SPD 10/06 - 13 AND 15

Maintenance locations SPD 10/06 - 13 and 15 are both found in Bastrop County. SPD
10/06 - 13 is located just south of the Colorado River, east of County Road (CR) 304, while SPD
10/06 - 15 is located a short distance east of FM 20 (Figure 11). The maintenance activity at
each of the 2 locations consists of the excavation of a short section of the pipeline within the
confines of the previously disturbed ROW and the repair of the anomaly present at each.
4.4.1

Area Environment

Location SPD 10/06 - 13 is situated in an open plowed field that has been recently
planted with grass (Figure 12). Mapped soils are mapped as Axtell fine sandy loam (AfA). This
is a nearly level soil (0 to 1 percent slopes) located on old, high terraces. Areas are mostly long
and narrow and range from about 15 to 70 acres in size. The surface layer is fine sandy loam
about 13 inches (32.5 cm) thick. The subsoil, to a depth of 34 inches (85.0 cm), is mottled clay.
The next layer to a depth of 60 inches (150.0 cm) is mottled sandy clay (NRCS 2006).
Location SPD 10/06 - 15 is situated in an arroyo that has been severely eroded (Figure
13). No in situ soils were observed at this location, although they are mapped as Crocket fine
sandy loam (CsD3). These soils are gently sloping to sloping (3 to 8 percent) and are mostly in
abandoned cropland that is adjacent to deeply cut, V-shaped drainageways. Most of the
drainageways and gullies, which make up about 30 to 40 percent of the mapped areas, are
uncrossable by farm machinery. The surface layer is mainly fine sandy loam 4 inches (10.0 cm)
thick, but in places it is loam. The subsoil, to a depth of 52 inches (130.0 cm), is mottled clay.
The underlying layer, to a depth of 64 inches (160.0 cm), is mottled clay loam (NRCS 2006).

Archival Review

A review of the THC’s Atlas database indicated the presence of 2 previously recorded
sites (41BP48 and 41BP51) within 0.5 miles (0.8 km) of SPD 10/06 - 13. While very little data is
available for site 41BP48, it is assumed to be an aboriginal encampment based on the presence
of “flakes” at the site. Site 41BP51 is also an aboriginal encampment. Both of these sites are
recorded on a bend of the Colorado River approximately 1500 feet (457 m) northwest of SPD
10/06 - 13. No previously recorded sites are documented in the vicinity of SPD 10/06 - 15.
However, 2 cemeteries (the Community Cemetery and an unnamed cemetery) are mapped
within 1000 feet (305.0 m) of SPD 10/06 - 15. According to the Atlas files, no formal cultural
resources surveys have been conducted at either of these 2 maintenance locations.
4.4.3

Assessment Conducted

During the field assessment of location SPD 10/06 - 13, the archeologist excavated a
total of 2 shovel tests at the maintenance location. Table 4 presents the resulting shovel test
data. In addition, the archeologist also conducted surface inspection along the ROW from the
point of ROW access up to the maintenance location. This visually assessed area, along with
the shovel test locations, is presented in Figure 11.
Due to the eroded nature of the setting at SPD 10/06 - 15, as well as the lack of any in
situ soils, shovel testing was deemed to be unwarranted at this location. As such, only a visual
inspection of the eroded surface was conducted. In addition, the archeologist also conducted

Results

The investigations conducted at locations SPD 10/06 - 17, 18, and 23 produced entirely
negative results. No cultural materials were observed on the surface or within any of the
excavated shovel tests at these locations.
4.6.5

Recommendations

Based on the negative results of the cultural resources assessments at locations SPD
10/06 - 17, 18, and 23, it is Horizon’s professional opinion that no significant cultural resources
will be impacted by the maintenance activities at these locations and that no further cultural
resources investigations are warranted. Horizon recommends that cultural resources clearance
be granted for these locations.

SPD 10/06 - 24 AND 25

Maintenance locations SPD 10/06 - 24 and 25 are both situated in Travis County. SPD
10/06 - 23 is located just off of the Fagerquist Road, roughly 1.3 miles (2.1 km) west of the
Travis and Bastrop County line (Figure 19). SPD 10/06 - 25 is located adjacent to a private
driveway off of Elroy Road, roughly 2.5 miles (4.0 km) west of the Travis and Bastrop County
line. The maintenance activity at each of the 2 locations consists of the excavation of a short

section of the pipeline within the confines of the previously disturbed ROW and the repair of the
anomaly present at each.
4.7.1

Area Environment

Location SPD 10/06 - 24 is situated on the east slope of an ephemeral drainage of Dry
Creek to the north, while SPD 10/06 - 25 is on a slope adjacent to the driveway of a private
residence (Figures 20 and 21). Soils at SPD 10/06 - 24 are mapped as Burleson gravelly clay
(BtC). This soil occupies long and narrow areas below ridges or above valleys of less sloping
Burleson gravelly clay. About 50 percent of the soil surface is covered with chert rock and
gravel. The surface layer, about 40 inches (100.0 cm) thick, is clay that contains about 10
percent gravel. The underlying material, to a depth of 60 inches (150.0 cm), is silty clay (NRCS
2006).
Soils at SPD 10/06 - 25 are mapped as Houston black gravelly clay (HoD2). This soil
occupies ridges and sideslopes. Slopes are single and complex (2 to 8 percent). Areas of this
soil are long and narrow and range from 20 to 50 acres in size. Chert rock, mostly 1 to 3 inches
(2.5 to 7.5 cm) in diameter, covers 30 to 75 percent of the surface in most areas. The surface
layer is gravelly clay about 24 inches (60.0 cm) thick. The next layer, which extends to a depth
of 70 inches (175.0 cm), is clay that contains pockets of chert gravel (NRCS 2006).

Archival Review

A review of the THC’s Atlas database indicated the presence of 1 previously recorded
site within 0.5 miles (0.8 km) of SPD 10/06 - 24. This site, 41TV1665, consists of a sparse
scatter of several aboriginally tested cobbles and 5 to 10 chert flakes associated with an outcrop
of chert gravels. It is not considered to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. It is located
roughly 800 feet (244.0 m) west of SPD 10/06 - 24. No sites are documented within 0.5 miles
(0.8 km) of SPD 10/06 - 25. According to the Atlas, no formal cultural resources surveys have
been conducted in the vicinity of either of these locations.
4.7.3

Assessment Conducted

During the field assessment, the archeologist excavated a total of 1 shovel test at
maintenance location SPD 10/06 - 24, and 2 shovel tests at SPD 10/06 -25. Table 7 below
presents the resulting shovel test data. In addition, the archeologist also conducted surface
inspection along the ROW from the point of ROW access up to each of the maintenance
locations. The visually assessed areas, along with the shovel test locations, are presented in
Figure 19.

Results

The shovel test excavated at SPD 10/06 - 24 produced negative results. However, 1
burned tertiary chert flake was observed on the downward slope of the landform in the ROW
toward the drainage of Dry Creek. Continued surface inspection failed to produce additional
cultural materials. As only 1 chert flake was observed, this location appears to represent an
isolated occurrence instead of a distinct site, and for this reason it was not formally recorded as
a site. Rather, the chert gravels prevalent across the area were undoubtedly targeted as a lithic
resource by aboriginal people, and sporadic evidence of the usage of the resources for lithic
procurement is likely scattered over the area as in the case of nearby 41TV1665. If additional
cultural materials had been present, they would have been confined to shallow or surface

contexts by the gravelly clay soils, and, as a result, would have been easily observable during
the investigations.
The shovel tests at SPD 10/06 - 25 also produced negative results. However, a sparse
scatter of historic debris, including whiteware, bottle glass, and crockery, was observed on the
edge of the ROW at this location. Upon further inspection, the foundation of a historic-age
structure was viewed upslope, outside of the ROW on private property. The sparse amount of
cultural materials found on the surface at this location, coupled with the lack of any subsurface
cultural deposits, suggests that these materials are in a secondary context that resulted from
being washed downslope from the historic occupation above, outside of the ROW.
Because
the observed artifacts were assessed as being out of their original context, and because the
intact portion of the historic occupation that they are associated with is located outside of the
ROW on private property, this location was not formally recorded as a site.
4.7.5

Recommendations

Although 1 chert flake was observed at SPD 10/06 - 24, its presence is considered an
isolated occurrence. The dense, gravelly clay soils at this location have no potential to contain
deeply buried, stratified cultural deposits, and because of this, it is Horizon’s professional
opinion that no significant cultural resources will be impacted by the maintenance activity at this
location and that no further cultural resources investigations are warranted.
Horizon
recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted for SPD 10/06 - 24.
Similarly, although a sparse scatter of historic debris was observed at SPD 10/06 -25, it
was assessed as slope wash material that has been removed from its original context outside of
the ROW on private property. The dense, gravelly clay soils at this location also have no
potential for deeply buried, stratified cultural deposits. Because of this, it is Horizon’s
professional opinion that no significant cultural resources will be impacted by the maintenance
activities at this location and that no further cultural resources investigations are warranted.
Horizon recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted for SPD 10/06 - 25 as well.

SPD 10/06 - 33, 34, 35, AND 36

Maintenance locations SPD 10/06 - 33, 34, 35, and 36 are all situated in Travis County.
All 4 locations lie within an approximately 1-mile (1.6 km) strip of ROW between FM 973 to the
west and Elroy Road to the east (Figure 22). The maintenance activity at each of the 4
locations consists of the excavation of a short section of the pipeline within the confines of the
previously disturbed ROW and the repair of the anomaly present at each.
4.8.1

Area Environment

Location SPD 10/06 - 33 is situated on the north side of Elroy Road in a low-lying, wet
area (Figure 23). Soils at this location are mapped as Tinn clay (Tv). The Tinn series consists
of very deep, moderately well-drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous
clayey alluvium. These soils are on floodplains of streams that drain the Blackland Prairies.

Slopes are predominantly less than 1 percent but range from 0 to 2 percent. The soil
formed in calcareous clayey alluvium. These soils are moderately well drained, permeability is
very slow, and runoff is low. The surface layer, about 18 inches (45.0 cm) thick, is silty clay or
clay. The subsoil contains clay with Calcium carbonate masses and concretions ranging from
none to common. Flooding is common except where the soil is protected (NRCS 2006).
Location SPD 10/06 - 34 is situated in a boggy tributary of Dry Creek (Figure 24). Soils
at this location are mapped as Houston black clay (HnB), and have a profile similar to Houston
black clay (HnC2), which has been described earlier in the text.
Locations SPD 10/06 - 35 and 36 are both found in a cleared, terraced pasture west of
McAngus Road (Figures 25 and 26). Soils at these locations are mapped as Houston black clay
(HnC2), which has been described earlier in the text.

Assessment Conducted

During the field assessment, the archeologist excavated a total of 2 shovel tests at
maintenance location SPD 10/06 - 34. Table 8 below presents the resulting shovel test data.
Shovel tests were not conducted at SPD 10/06 - 33, 35, or 36 due to several reasons, the main
one being the presence of standing water. In addition, these 3 locations were considered to be
low-probability areas with soils incapable of containing buried deposits. However, the
archeologist did conduct surface inspection at these locations as well as along the ROW from
the point of ROW access up to each of the maintenance locations. The visually assessed
areas, along with the shovel test locations, are presented in Figure 22.

Cultural Resources Assessments of 21 Maintenance Locations along the Longhorn Partners Pipeline

5.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

5.1

SUMMARY OF RESULTS

The cultural resources survey of the 21 maintenance locations resulted in the
documentation of cultural materials associated with a formal archeological site at only 1
maintenance location (SPD 10/06 - 11). The ROW at this location traverses site 41BP299, a
multi-component site consisting of an aboriginal open campsite, historic military debris
associated with Camp Swift, and the Claiborne Cemetery. During the assessment of location
SPD 10/06 -11, chert flaking debris was observed on the surface within previously disturbed
areas. No historic-age materials were observed, and the Claiborne Cemetery is located a
considerable distance to the south, outside of the ROW. The assessment of this location
revealed that prior impacts to the site deposits within the existing ROW have been considerable,
including the initial construction of the pipeline as well as the more recent construction of a valve
station associated with an adjacent pipeline. While the areas of site 41BP299 located outside of
the existing ROW may contain potentially significant cultural deposits, the degree of disturbance
within the current ROW suggests that the cultural deposits within the ROW lack any integrity.
Because of this, it is Horizon’s professional opinion that the deposits of site 41BP299 within the
existing ROW do not contribute to the overall NRHP eligibility status of the site, and that no
further investigations within the ROW at this location are warranted.
The cultural resources survey of the remaining 20 maintenance locations resulted in
essentially negative findings at all 20 of the locations. These findings are summarized in Table
10. While 1 tertiary flake was observed at SPD 10/06 - 24, no other cultural materials were
observed on the surface or within the excavated shovel tests at this location. As such, the
solitary chert flake was considered to be an isolated occurrence and was not recorded as a site.
Similarly, a sparse scatter of surficial historic debris observed near SPD 10/06 - 25 was
assessed as being slope wash material in a secondary context that had eroded downslope from
a historic homestead located outside of the ROW on private property. As the actual historic
homestead is situated outside of the ROW on private property, it also was not recorded as a
site. No prehistoric or historic-age cultural materials constituting actual intact archeological sites
were observed at any of the 20 remaining locations. If any cultural materials had been present,
they would have been confined to surface contexts by the exposed limestone bedrock or
shallow, gravelly clay deposits prevalent along the ROW. No areas containing any potential for
deeply buried, stratified cultural deposits were observed at any of the 20 assessed locations.

HJN 050175 AR

Chapter 5.0: Summary and Recommendations

Based on the negative results of the cultural resources survey at these 20 locations, as well as
the low potential for deeply buried, stratified cultural deposits, it is Horizon’s professional opinion
that the maintenance activities at the remaining 20 locations will have no impact on significant
cultural resources and that no further investigations are warranted.

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

The survey of the 21 maintenance locations produced negative results at all locations
with the exception of SPD 10/06 - 11. The deposits of site 41BP299 at this location have been
heavily disturbed by pipeline and valve station construction, and as such, do not contribute to
the overall NRHP eligibility status of the site. The survey of the remaining 20 locations
produced no evidence of intact cultural deposits within the ROW. With this in mind, Horizon
recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted for all 21 maintenance locations.
