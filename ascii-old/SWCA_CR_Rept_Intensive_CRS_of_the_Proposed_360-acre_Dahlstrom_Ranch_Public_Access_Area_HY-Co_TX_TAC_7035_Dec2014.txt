ABSTRACT
This report addresses the results of intensive cultural resources investigations conducted by SWCA
Environmental Consultants (SWCA) on behalf of Hays County, using funds administered by Texas Parks
and Wildlife Department (TPWD), in support of the proposed Dahlstrom Ranch Public Access Area
(DRPAA), located in northeastern Hays County, Texas. Hays County proposes to construct a 360-acre
public access area, including a visitor entry and parking area, approximately 3.15 miles of hard and natural
service trails, benches, interpretive and directional signage, and trail drainage crossings. Environmental
impacts from project construction are considered minimal and disturbances are generally surficial.
The project area is located approximately 4 miles west of Buda in northeastern Hays County, along the
southern side of Farm-to-Market Road (FM) 967, an area that is quickly filling with residential and
commercial development. Although the land is privately owned, compliance with the Antiquities Code of
Texas is a requisite attached to TPWD funding (Texas Recreation Trails Fund grant) and Hays County’s
status as a political subdivision of the state.
SWCA performed a background review of the project area and surrounding 1-mile radius and an intensive
pedestrian inventory with shovel testing of the entire project area. The goal of the work was to locate
cultural resources within the project area, establish vertical and horizontal site boundaries as appropriate
with regard to the project area, and evaluate any site recorded for eligibility as a State Antiquities Landmark
(SAL). All work was conducted in accordance with the standards and guidelines of the Council of Texas
Archeologists (CTA) and Texas Historical Commission’s (THC) minimum survey standards under Texas
Antiquities Permit No. 7035. The background review identified no previous surveys nor recorded
archaeological sites within the DRPAA (Atlas 2014).
Intensive cultural resources survey of the entire 360-acre tract revealed shallow, rocky upland soils across
the majority of the project area, which gradually slopes downward toward Onion Creek to the south. No
alluvial soils or terraces were identified. Naturally occurring outcrops of siliceous materials, mainly cherts,
cover significant portions of the project area. A total of 122 shovel tests were excavated where the thin soils
held a potential for buried deposits. With few exceptions bedrock was encountered 10 to 15 cm below
surface. The investigations documented five sites, including four prehistoric sites (41HY495, 41HY496,
41HY497, and 41HY498) and one historic archaeological site (41HY499). All four prehistoric sites are
diffuse and sparse lithic procurement sites consisting of early stage reduction debris. No formal tools,
temporally diagnostic artifacts, discernible features, or substantial accumulations of debitage were
identified. The prehistoric sites have poor integrity as a result of long-term surface exposure, slopewash,
colluvial downslope movement, and various modern and historic activities.
A primary concern in the investigations was the possibility of historic components that could contribute to
the larger historic Dahlstrom Ranch. One historic site (41HY499) was recorded near the northeastern corner
of the project area. The site is a sparse scatter of twentieth century historic artifacts that appear to be a
component of a larger site that extends beyond the survey area. No structural elements such as buildings
or features were identified. The site’s SAL eligibility is recommended as undetermined pending a further
assessment of the larger context and associations. Avoidance is recommended.
Although the prehistoric sites are not recommended as eligible as SALs, they have a potential to contribute
to the overall educational, scientific, and recreational purposes of the park. Accordingly, select portions of
the lithic procurement sites are recommended for preservation and incorporation into the park design. These
areas include parts of sites where lithic reduction activities and natural outcrops are most evident and dense,
allowing opportunities for observation and education.

INTRODUCTION

PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

On behalf of Hays County, using funds
administered by Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department (TPWD), SWCA conducted an
intensive cultural resources survey of the proposed
360-acre Dahlstrom Ranch Public Access Area
(DRPAA), located in northeastern Hays County,
Texas (Figure 1). Although the land is privately
owned, compliance with the Antiquities Code of
Texas is a requisite attached to TPWD funding
(Texas Recreation Trails Fund grant) and Hays
County’s status as a political subdivision of the
state. All work was conducted in accordance with
the standards and guidelines of the Council of
Texas Archeologists (CTA) and Texas Historical
Commission’s (THC’s) minimum survey standards
under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7035.

The roughly 360-acre project area is located
approximately 4 miles west of Buda in northeastern
Hays County, along the south side of Farm-toMarket Road (FM) 967, and appears on portions of
the Mountain City U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
7.5-minute topographic quadrangle map (3097222). Based on current aerial photography, the
project area is mainly surrounded by pasture, as
well as residential subdivisions and is in a semirural setting (Figure 2). Within the project’s
boundaries, there has been very little development;
however, the property owners have managed the
land well. The landscape is mostly covered in
native prairie grasses and cactus, and dotted with
healthy oaks, elms, juniper, and mesquite (Figure
3). The project area is oriented generally north to
south and extends across uplands that gently slope
down toward a central ephemeral tributary that
meanders generally north to south through the
project area and drains into Onion Creek
approximately 800 meters south of the southern
project boundary.

The proposed construction within the 360-acre
public access area will include a visitor entry and
parking area, approximately 3.15 miles of hard and
natural service trails, benches, interpretive and
directional signage, and trail drainage crossings.
Environmental impacts are considered minimal and
disturbances are generally surficial.

ENVIRONMENTAL DESCRIPTION

SWCA archaeologists Matthew Carter, Alamea
Young, and Jessica Ulmer conducted the field work
on October 8–10, 2014. The purpose of the work
was to locate and identify all prehistoric and
historic archaeological sites within the project area,
establish vertical and horizontal site boundaries as
appropriate with regard to the project area, and
evaluate the significance and eligibility of any site
recorded for listing as a State Antiquities Landmark
(SAL). All investigations were conducted in
accordance with the CTA and THC’s minimum
survey standards, with any exceptions thoroughly
documented.

The DRPAA consists of 360 acres of land that
includes numerous karst features, providing
recharge to the Edwards Aquifer (Figure 4). The
area is on the eroded margins of the Central Texas
Edwards Plateau, bordering the Blackland Prairie to
the south and east. The southern and eastern
margins of the plateau are well defined by the
Balcones Escarpment, a steep scarp formed by the
Balcones fault zone. Subsequent to the uplift along
the fault, the edges of the plateau have slowly
eroded away, creating much more of a textured,
osmotic boundary between the plateau and prairies.
Waterways, which drain the plateau into the
adjacent prairies to the east and coastal plain to the
south, become more deeply incised heading
westward.

The plateau is distinguishable from surrounding
physiographic regions by its prominent Cretaceousage limestone, dolomite, sandstone, and shale
deposits (Figure 5). The Edwards Plateau
physiographic region is broad and diverse with the
western plateau margins blending slowly into the
mountain and basin physiographic regions
westward and abruptly transitioning into the plains
regions to the east. The elevation of the western
Edwards Plateau is approximately 2,000 feet above
mean sea level (amsl) and gradually decreases
eastward to about 600 feet amsl along its eastern
margins. Despite the higher elevation, the western
and northern margins of the plateau are relatively
flat in comparison to the diverse topographic relief
of its eastern and southern margins. This abrupt
separation of the eastern and southern extent of the
Edwards Plateau from the plains to the east is
clearly demarcated by flat-topped hills with eroded
tiers that early Spanish explorers likened to
balconies (balcones) from which the feature gets
the name Balcones Escarpment (Swanson
2004:28). For roughly 300 miles, the uplifted and
elevated Balcones Escarpment divides the Edwards
Plateau from the physiographic regions of the
Blackland Prairie to the east and South Texas Plain
to the south (Spearing 1991; Swanson 2004). Thus,
the liminal zone of the eastern Edwards Plateau and
adjacent prairies, periodically intersected by
waterways draining the plateau, offered a broad
spectrum of resources for prehistoric and historic
inhabitants.

FAUNA
The use of natural or ecoregions is also applied to
the distribution of fauna, although reference is also
made to the biotic provinces. The use of biotic
provinces as proposed by Blair (1950) has been
updated and further refined through the years. For
mammals, Davis and Schmidly (1997) reduced the
number of regions in Texas to four: the TransPecos, Plains Country, East Texas, and the Rio
Grande Plains. The Blackland Prairie is included in
the East Texas region, and the Edwards Plateau is
within the Plains Country.

formations outcropping on the surface.

Davis and Schmidly (1994) list 25 species that are
or were found in most of the regions. Larger species
include bison (Bos bison), black bear (Ursus

4

americanus), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus
virginianus), mountain lion (Felis concolor),
bobcat (Lynx rufus), coyote (Canis latrans),
common gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus),
American beaver (Castor canadensis), common
raccoon (Procyon lotor), and Virginia opossum
(Didelphis virginiana). Smaller mammals include
ringtail (Bassariscus astutus), long-tailed weasel
(Mustela frenata), striped skunk (Mephitis
mephitis),
eastern
cottontail
(Sylvilagus
floridanus), black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus
californicus), hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon
hispidus), five species of bats, and four species of
mice. Rodents are the most numerous and account
for the majority of regionally specific species.

communities into physiognomic regions (Frye et al.
1984).
The natural regions are further divided into
subregions (Diamond et al. 1987; Diggs et al. 1999;
Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs 1978).
The Balcones Canyonlands is one such subdivision
within the Edwards Plateau, and the prairies to the
east comprise a series of other subdivisions. Of
significance, the project area is at the ecotonal
boundary of distinctive vegetation regimes along
the eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau and
eastward to the Blackland Prairies. Although
modern and historic impacts to the Edwards Plateau
and to the Blackland Prairies have substantially
altered the vegetation composition of both regions,
remnant populations of these regions still exist,
providing an insight into the prehistoric plant
communities (Riskind and Diamond 1986;
Diamond and Smeins 1985; Fowler and Dunlap
1986; Smeins and Diamond 1983).

The intersection of the Blackland Prairie and the
Edwards Plateau is an ecotonal zone with a diverse
faunal assemblage. Kutac and Caran (1994) list 349
species of birds regularly associated with the
region; Toomey and Caran (1994) list 82 species of
mammals; and Hampton (1994) lists 41 amphibians
and 94 reptiles. Caran and Hubbs (1994) note 130
species of fishes, including both historic and extinct
taxa. Overall, the majority of mammals are small,
from the orders of rodentia and chiroptera (bats).
The overwhelming majority of the fish species are
small as well with Cypriniformes (minnows and
carps) as the most numerous family.

SOILS AND GEOLOGY
The surface geology mapped for the project area is
predominantly Edwards Limestone (Ked) (Barnes
1981). The Edwards Limestone, dating to the
Lower Cretaceous, is light gray in color and made
of alternating layers of hard and soft strata (Barnes
1981). Significantly, the Cretaceous formation is
chert bearing, providing an abundance of highquality lithic materials used by prehistoric
inhabitants. A small portion of the DRPAA along
the northeastern/eastern margin of the project area
is mapped as Del Rio Clay and Georgetown
Limestone, undivided (Kdg) (Barnes 1981). Also
dating to the Lower Cretaceous, this comprises
medium gray, blocky, calcareous and gypsiferous
Del Rio clay, and light gray layers of the mostly
limestone Georgetown Formation (Barnes 1981).

FLORA
Texas has been subdivided into natural regions
based upon variations in topography, geology, soil,
flora, fauna, and climate. Blair (1950) divided the
state into seven biotic provinces that corresponded
to animal habitat and vegetation regions, and
generalized physiography. The project area is at the
intersection of the Balconian and Texan biotic
provinces. Blair’s division of seven provinces was
later refined into the present system of 10 or 11
“ecoregions,” or natural vegetation regions. The
two principle physiographic regions within the
project area, the Edwards Plateau and the Blackland
Prairie, are also separate ecoregions as defined by
Omernik (1987). Omernik’s boundaries were
subsequently further refined (Griffith et al. 2004).
Within the ecoregions, additional, specific
divisions can be made by dominant vegetation

The majority of the project area soils are mapped as
the Rumple-Comfort association, 1–8 percent
slopes (RUD). The Rumple series soils consists of
moderately deep, well-drained, moderately slowly
permeable soils formed in residuum and colluvium
over indurated limestone on gently to moderately
sloping uplands (NRCS 2014). The Comfort series
consists of well-drained soils that are shallow to
indurated limestone bedrock formed in clayey
residuum derived from dolomitic limestone of the

(Early, Middle, and Late), although, as this report
addresses, various labels have been applied to the
last few centuries of the Archaic. To avoid straying
too far down a tautological maze, we generically
call the period from approximately 600 B.C. to A.D.
700 “the end of the Archaic.”

Lower Cretaceous period on plateaus and ridges
(NRCS 2014).
A small portion of the DRPAA soils along the
northeastern/eastern margin of the project area are
mapped as Tarpley clay, 1–3 percent slopes (TaB).
The Tarpley series consists of shallow, welldrained, slowly permeable soils that formed in
calcareous clayey residuum over limestone bedrock
of the Cretaceous period on nearly level to
moderately sloping upland plateaus and ridges
(NRCS 2014).

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD
Paleoindian artifacts and sites date from about
11,500-8800 radiocarbon years B.P. and are
relatively common in Central Texas (Collins 2004),
although few have been intensively studied in the
Hays County area. The period begins during the
close of the Pleistocene with the earliest evidence
of humans in the Central Texas region. Diagnostic
artifacts of the period include lanceolate-shaped,
fluted projectile points such as Clovis, Folsom, and
Plainview. These projectile points were hafted onto
wooden
spears,
launched
from
atlatls
(spearthrowers), and often used to hunt big game
such as mammoth, mastodons, bison, camel, and
horse (Black 1989). During the Paleoindian period,
a hunter-gatherer adaptation strategy was employed
with increased harvesting of flora and small game
as the big game died off and the climate warmed
following the end of the Pleistocene ice age.
Representative Central Texas Paleoindian sites
include Kincaid Rock shelter, Wilson-Leonard,
Gault, and St. Mary’s Hall (Collins 2004).

CULTURAL BACKGROUND AND
SETTING
Hays County is on the eastern edge of the Edwards
Plateau and near the eastern margins of the Central
Texas archaeological region, as defined by Suhm
(1960), Prewitt (1981, 1985), Collins (2004), and
other researchers. Of course, the Central Texas
archaeological region is an artificial construct, and
its boundaries are somewhat arbitrary (Collins
2004:102). As Collins (2004:103) points out, it is
unlikely that any group in the past 11,000 years had
their key resources, geographic range, or political
sphere conform to these boundaries. It is worth
noting that Perttula (2004:Fig 1.1) extends the
boundaries of Central Texas much farther east than
many researchers. Nevertheless, situated as it is, on
the Edwards Plateau’s margins, the sites identified
within the project area share many traits in common
with “classic” Central Texas sites (i.e., those above
the Balcones Escarpment).

ARCHAIC PERIOD
As the Paleoindian period came to an end, humans
began to harvest more intensively local floral and
faunal resources (Collins 2004). Material culture
became more diverse, and the use of burned rock
middens and ovens became widespread. This
period is known as the Archaic period and dates
from approximately 8800 to 1200 B.P. in Central
Texas (Collins 2004; Johnson and Goode 1994).
While Collins (2004) and Johnson and Goode
(1994) subdivide the Archaic into Early, Middle,
and Late subperiods, we have added the
Transitional subperiod after the Late Archaic for
reasons discussed below.

As noted above, the project area is near the eastern
edge of the Central Texas archaeological region. Its
occupants likely ranged west, deeper into the
Edwards Plateau, and east, onto the rolling
Blackland Prairie. Inhabitants of the area, therefore,
were influenced by cultural developments taking
place in Central Texas, as well as, to the east.
Regardless of the intensity or nature of influences
from off the plateau, we rely on more developed
chronologies from Central Texas to summarize the
culture history of the area. Following standard
chronological divisions, we divide the prehistoric
cultural sequence into three periods: Paleoindian,
Archaic, and Late Prehistoric. The Archaic period
is commonly subdivided into three subperiods

Early Archaic
Early Archaic artifacts and sites date from about
8800 to 6000 B.P. (Collins 2004). Once thought to
6

be Paleoindian in age, some unstemmed point types
such as Angostura have recently been recognized as
the first Early Archaic diagnostic styles (Collins
2004). By about 8000 B.P., these points were
replaced by stemmed varieties such as Early Split
Stem, Martindale, and Uvalde (Black 1989; Collins
2004). Most sites were open campsites although
cave sites have been found (Collins 2004). Current
site distribution data suggest that Early Archaic
peoples were concentrated along the eastern and
southern margins of Edwards Plateau in areas with
more stable water sources (Collins 2004;
McKinney 1981). Specialized tools, perhaps used
in woodworking, known as Guadalupe and Nueces
bifaces, were prevalent in this period (Collins
2004). While subsistence data are sparse, it appears
that people were hunting deer and other small
animals, fishing, and cooking bulbs in earth ovens
(Collins 2004). This strategy evolved, in part, due
to the extinction of megafauna and the changing
climate at the beginning of the Holocene
(McKinney 1981).

Late Archaic
Late Archaic artifacts and sites date from about
4000 to 2250 B.P. The period began with very xeric
conditions but gradually became more mesic
(Collins 2004). Characteristic dart point types
include Bulverde, Pedernales, Marshall, and
Marcos (Collins 2004). Increasingly complex and
sedentary cultural manifestations first appeared in
the Late Archaic. Sites of the Late Archaic are very
common and include burned rock middens, open
campsites, and lithic procurement sites. Population
increases are evidenced by large cemeteries and
grave goods. Also, trade and exchange networks
between cultures appear to have increased in
complexity as evidenced by exotic goods in sites
and cemeteries (Black 1989). Bement (1991)
interprets the evidence for group investment in the
Thunder Valley sinkhole cemetery, dated to 2900
B.P. based on stratigraphy, to indicate that groups
were declaring control over a particular territorial
range during the Late Archaic. Representative sites
of the Central Texas Late Archaic include the
Anthon and Loeve Fox sites (Collins 2004).

Middle Archaic
Middle Archaic artifacts and sites date from about
6000 to 4000 B.P. with multi-use bifacial knives
becoming more common. Characteristic Middle
Archaic projectile points include Bell, Andice,
Taylor, Nolan, and Travis (Black 1989; Collins
2004). These artifacts could have served as knives
and projectile points. Bison were hunted
intermittently during the Middle Archaic, but as the
climate became drier, a reliance on dry climate
plants such as sotol probably became common. The
end of the Middle Archaic may have been the peak
of the mid-Holocene xeric conditions in Central
Texas (Collins 2004). The climatic change was
accompanied by a technological change as Nolan
and Travis points, which are thick, narrow-bladed
forms, first appeared in the archaeological record
(Collins 2004). Burned rock middens and earth
ovens became more prevalent circa 5000 B.P. and
became increasingly common, although their exact
functions may have varied based on the culture and
environment (Johnson and Goode 1994).
Representative sites of the Texas Middle Archaic
include the Landslide, Wounded Eye, Gibson, and
Panther Springs sites (Collins 2004).

Transitional Archaic
As Collins (2004:384-385) notes, diverse and
comparatively
complex
archaeological
manifestations toward the end of the Late Archaic
attest to the emergence of kinds of human conduct
without precedent in the area. This period (22501250 B.P.), referred to as the Transitional Archaic
(Turner and Hester 1999) or Terminal Archaic
(Black 1989), is not recognized by all researchers.
Other chronologies extend the Late Archaic to
1200-1250 B.P. (Collins 2004; Johnson and Goode
1994) to encompass this later subperiod. Johnson et
al. (1962) originally designated the Transitional
Archaic as a subperiod of the Archaic because of
the similarities between the latest dart point types
and the earliest arrow point types. Since then,
however, the designation has failed to be
universally accepted by researchers. In two recent
chronologies for Central Texas, Collins (2004) does
not include the Transitional as a subperiod of the
Archaic, and Johnson and Goode (1994) separate
the Late Archaic into two subperiods designated
Late Archaic I and Late Archaic II. The
Transitional Archaic, as it is used here, closely
corresponds to Johnson and Goode’s (1994) Late
7

drying trend may have resulted in a change in
vegetation that made central and South Texas more
conducive to bison migration into the area. Bison
remains in archaeological sites in the region
became common after 750 B.P. (Dillehay 1974;
Huebner 1991).

Archaic II, but begins after the appearance of
Marcos points, not with it. In this scheme, the
Transitional Archaic coincides with the last two
style intervals recognized by Collins (2004:Table 2)
for the Late Archaic subperiod.
During the Transitional Archaic, smaller dart point
forms such as Darl, Ensor, Fairland, and Frio were
developed (Turner and Hester 1999). These points
were probably ancestral to the first Late Prehistoric
arrow point types and may have overlapped
temporally with them (Hester 2004; Houk and
Lohse 1993).

Most Toyah sites have the distinctive Perdiz arrow
point type, and some sites also have bison
processing tool kits. This technological change has
been interpreted as a spread of an ethnic group by
Johnson (1994) and as the spread of technological
ideas in response to opportunities provided by an
increased bison population in the Late Prehistoric
by Ricklis (1992). Increasing complexity in
subsistence patterns and very high prehistoric
populations are postulated for the Late Prehistoric
period (Black 1989; Collins 2004). Although no
faunal remains were reported from the Slab Site,
archaeologists recovered numerous Perdiz arrow
points and Leon Plain ceramics indicating a Toyah
occupation (Patterson 1987). Representative sites
of the Central Texas Late Prehistoric include the
Kyle, Smith, and Currie sites (Collins 2004).

Several researchers believe that the increased
interaction between groups at the end of the Late
Archaic was an important catalyst for cultural
change (Collins 2004; Johnson and Goode 1994).
This change may have included increased regional
stress and conflict between groups as interaction
became more frequent.
LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD
By the end of the Transitional Archaic, the bow and
arrow technologies were introduced and are
indicated in the archaeological record by the small
arrow points. The Late Prehistoric period dates
from 1250 to 260 B.P. (Collins 2004). Characteristic
artifacts include small arrowpoints like Perdiz and
Scallorn as well as a variety of specific use tools.
The Austin and Toyah intervals of the Late
Prehistoric, originally recognized by Suhm (1960)
and Jelks (1962), remain accepted divisions for the
period. These style intervals may represent distinct
cultural entities (Johnson 1994), although others
challenge this view (Black and Creel 1997).

EUROPEAN CONTACT
In the early Historic period (1630 A.D. to Present),
the period of European contact and settlement in
Texas, the general Hays County area was inhabited
by several aboriginal groups including the
Tonkawa, Lipan Apache, Comanche, Jumano,
Catqueza, and Karankawa (Cecil and Greene 2014;
Foster 1995; Newcomb 2002). The first Europeans
into the region were probably Spanish explorers
and missionaries (Cecil and Greene 2014; Foster
1995). Governor Domingo Terán de los Ríos’
expedition crossed through the southern part of
Hays County in 1691–1692 (Cecil and Greene
2014; Foster 1995). In 1709, the expedition of
Espinosa-Olivares-Aguirre passed through and
explored parts of the San Marcos River (Cecil and
Greene 2014; Foster 1995). Captain Domingo
Ramón’s expedition crossed through the southern
portion of Hays County in 1716 destined for
northeastern Texas to establish missions (Foster
2004). In 1721–1722 an expedition by Governor
Marqués de San Miguel de Aquayo’s passed near
San Marcos to establish a presidio and fortify

During the earlier Austin interval, burned rock
midden use may have reached its maximum based
on recent conclusions by Black and Creel (1997).
Characteristic arrow points of the Austin interval
include Scallorn and Edwards (Collins 2004;
Turner and Hester 1999). By the Toyah interval,
plainware ceramics appeared, indicating possible
influence in the Central Texas region from ceramic
producing cultures to the east and north (Perttula et
al. 1995). Contrary to bog pollen data (Collins et al.
1993), data from Hall’s Cave in Kerr County
indicate that the climate of Central Texas began to
dry around 1000 B.P. (Toomey et al. 1993). This
8

By the 1880–1900s the area began to recover
because of improved transportation, growth in the
cattle industry, and migration of people from other
states and countries (Cecil and Greene 2014). The
construction of the Hays County rail line that
connected San Marcos to Austin in 1880 and
subsequently connected San Marcos with San
Antonio assisted in this population growth, which
grew from 7,555 in 1880 to 14,142 in 1900 (Cecil
and Greene 2014).

Mission and San Francisco Xavier Presidio were
temporarily established in San Marcos (Cecil and
Greene 2014; Chipman 1992). A permanent
Spanish settlement was attempted in 1807 along the
San Marcos River, but was abandoned in 1811 due
to flooding and frequent attacks from Comanche
and Tonkawa Indians (Cecil and Greene 2014).
After Mexico gained independence from Spain, the
newly formed country used a policy of land grants
to encourage settlement in the sparsely populated
northern regions of Mexico. During the 1830s,
grants were issued in Hays County to Juan Martín
Veramendi (1831), Juan Vicente Campos (1832),
Thomas Jefferson Chambers (1834), and Thomas
G. McGehee (1835) (Cecil and Greene 2014).

The county’s economy and population went
relatively unchanged over the next half-century
(Cecil and Greene 2014). Notwithstanding the
effects of World War I, the 1930s depression, and
World War II, the county only suffered temporary
impediments (Cecil and Greene 2014). The county
remained predominantly agricultural (about 90
percent) in economic focus until the mid-1960s
(Cecil and Greene 2014). From the 1960s until the
present, educational and recently established
training facilities (e.g. Gary Job Training Center)
became more prominent and economically
productive (Cecil and Greene 2014).

REPUBLIC OF TEXAS ERA
In 1848, the state legislature established Hays
County from portions of the Travis County territory
with San Marcos as the county seat (Cecil and
Greene 2014). The county derived its name from
John Coffee Hays who led a company of Texas
Rangers (Cecil and Greene 2014; Richardson
1981). The establishment of the county along with
the construction of a stage line and sawmill (1848),
several cotton gins, grist mills, a shingle mill, and a
beef packery (1850–1885) assisted in encouraging
settlement into the area (Cecil and Greene 2014).
The population of Hays County rapidly grew from
387 in 1850 to 2,162 in 1860 primarily consisting
of settlers from Georgia, Arkansas, and old Texans
(Cecil and Greene 2014). To accommodate the
growing population a church (1847), several
schools (1849–1860), and the Johnson Institute
(1852) were formed (Cecil and Greene 2014).

THE DAHLSTROMS AND RUBYS
The DRPAA is part of the larger 2,254-acre
Dahlstrom Ranch, which was previously part of the
historic Ruby Ranch which had long been in Jack
Dahlstrom wife’s (Gay Ruby) family. The
following brief description of Jack Dahlstrom
draws from a recent article (Ferguson 2013) and his
2012 obituary.
Jack rose from poverty in Buda to ride the booms
and busts of Texas business in the twentieth
century. Dahlstrom built a highway construction
operation that employed as many as 2,300 workers
in nine states and two nations at its peak. He owned
21 airplanes, hobnobbed with President Lyndon B.
Johnson and constructed projects ranging from the
Houston Ship Channel to three triple-deck
interchanges on I-635 in Dallas.

POST-CIVIL WAR ERA
Subsequent to the Civil War, Texas entered the
Reconstruction period. Recovery during this period
was slow, but was assisted by an economy
supported by cattle. In 1867, George Neill drove the
first herd of cattle to Kansas, which was
subsequently followed by more drives (Cecil and
Greene 2014). In the eastern portions of the county,
farming became more profitable and also served as
impetus to further settlement (Cecil and Greene
2014).

Jack was born in Austin on September 27, 1928,
moving to Buda at an early age. His father, Eric
Carl Dahlstrom, was a local rancher, and his
mother, Dora Henrietta Saenger, grew up in the
German community of Cave Creek near
Fredericksburg. He attended Buda Schools and the
9

University of Texas. He married Gay Ruby, his
childhood sweetheart, on April 18, 1948.
Dahlstrom began his career in 1951 when he and
his brother-in-law, Jim Ruby, used equipment
owned by Jim’s father, Cecil, for brush clearing and
other ranch work. In 1951, Jim and Jack joined
forces with Cecil and started in the road-building
business (Figures 6 and 7); FM 150 from Kyle to
near Driftwood was the first road the company built
(Ferguson 2013).
Cecil also brought along an important political
connection—commercial ties with future President
Lyndon B. Johnson. In part as a result of this
connection, in two decades, Dahlstrom built a large
corporation founded upon large infrastructural
projects such as roads and dams. In 1968,
Dahlstrom bought out his father-in-law and in the
subsequent year bought his brother-in-law’s share
of the company (Ferguson 2013).

Figure 7. Jack Dahlstrom.

By 1971, Jack was the sole owner of Dahlstrom
Corporation. He worked in the Dallas area from
1961 to 1989. During this period, he performed
work in nine states and two countries, while
pursuing construction projects around the world.
According to his obituary, some of his many
achievements included construction of the DallasFort Worth Turnpike, the tunnel and roadways in
Big Bend Park, and the highway work through the
El Capitan mountain range in the 1950s and 1960s.
Projects during the 1970s and 1980s included Loop
635 around Dallas where he built three triple-deck
interchanges, Dallas/Fort Worth airport, four
sections of the North Dallas Tollway, the MoPac
Highway in Austin from Lady Bird Lake to
Highway 183, and the Port of Houston's ship
channel and turning basin in La Porte. Dahlstrom
Corporation worked for the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers constructing the Waurika Dam in
Oklahoma. He built his company into the third
largest general contractor on fixed-cost, federally

funded projects in the United States. Other
achievements
included collaboration with
Consolidated Coal Company in a visionary plan to
develop coal mining and extraction of oil in the tar
sands outside Eagle Pass, Texas.

FIELD METHODS
ARCHAEOLOGICAL FIELD SURVEY

But the economic crises in 1973 and the crash of the
mid-1980s forced an end to the business. His wife
later said he “wasn’t the kind to declare bankruptcy,
but he did go broke” (Ferguson 2013).

The field survey consisted of a team of three SWCA
archaeologists surveying the project area.
Subsurface investigations involved shovel tests that
were approximately 30 centimeters (cm) in
diameter and excavated in arbitrary 20-cm levels to
100 cm below surface unless soil characteristics or
bedrock precluded reaching that depth. The matrix
from each shovel test was screened through ¼-inch
mesh, and the location of each excavation was
plotted using a hand-held Global Positioning
System (GPS) receiver. Each shovel test was
recorded on a standardized form to document the
excavations. Backhoe trenching was not proposed
or conducted for this phase of investigations.

Jack’s father, Carl, lost the family cotton farm
during the Great Depression, but Jack and Gay
settled on the portion of the Ruby Ranch she had
inherited from her father. That property is now the
Dahlstrom Ranch. In 1989, the couple returned to
Buda, where Jack lived until he died on Feb. 2,
2012.

METHODS
BACKGROUND REVIEW

Appropriate State of Texas Archaeological Site
Data Forms were filled out for each site discovered
during the investigations. A detailed plan map of
each site was produced and locations were plotted
on USGS 7.5-minute topographic maps and
relevant project maps. Artifacts were tabulated,
analyzed, and documented in the field, but not
collected. Accordingly, no artifacts were curated.

SWCA conducted a thorough background cultural
resources and environmental literature search of the
project area and surrounding 1-mile radius. An
SWCA archaeologist examined the Leander, Texas
USGS 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle map on
the THC Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas).
This source provided information on the nature and
location of previously conducted archaeological
surveys and the location of previously recorded
cultural resources, including NRHP properties,
sites designated as SALs, Official Texas Historical
Markers, Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks
(RTHLs), cemeteries, and local neighborhood
surveys. However, the Atlas does not necessarily
list all previous work conducted within a specific
area. Previous cultural resources investigations
listed on the Atlas are limited to projects under the
purview of the Antiquities Code of Texas or the
NHPA. In addition, projects under these regulations
may not be posted on Atlas due to a delay between
fieldwork and report completion. As a part of the
review, an SWCA archaeologist reviewed the
TxDOT Historic Overlay, a mapping/Geographic
Information System database with historic maps
and resource information covering most portions of
the state (Foster et al. 2006). Aerial photographs

RESULTS
BACKGROUND REVIEW
A background review determined that the project
area is not known to have been previously
surveyed,
and
no
previously
recorded
archaeological sites are within the DRPAA (Atlas
2014). One archaeological site and SAL
(41HY448) and one RTHL (Carpenter Log Home)
are recorded within a 1-mile radius of the project
area (Atlas 2014).
The North Flatrock site (41HY448) is a lithic
procurement camp situated on an unnamed
tributary of Onion Creek northwest/upstream of
Flatrock Ford approximately 0.17 mile south of the
project area. The large quarry/camp contains
burned rock and distinct lithic reduction areas

FIELD SURVEY

including chert cores, unifacial tools, the distal
portion of a “mescal knife,” and a Nolan dart point
(Atlas 2014). A 2009 THC eligibility determination
recommends the site as eligible for inclusion in the
NRHP and it is listed as an SAL (Atlas 2014).

From October 8–10, 2014, SWCA archaeologists
examined the entire 360-acre DRPAA project area
in support of the proposed Hays County public
access area development. Investigators covered the
project area by utilizing pedestrian inspection along
parallel transects, supplemented with shovel testing
and visual inspection of available exposures (e.g.,
vertical cut banks and erosional channels). Within
the 360-acre project area, a total of 122 shovel tests
were excavated. This excavation interval exceeds
CTA/THC, Minimum Survey Standards, which
recommends one shovel test per 3 acres for project
areas larger than 100 acres. Eleven of the 122
shovel tests excavated were positive for cultural
material, all but one of which are associated with
archaeological sites (Appendix A). The other
shovel test (MC12) is an Isolated Find (IF). IFs are
defined as discrete locations of cultural material,
typically containing three artifacts or less, that do
not warrant designation as archaeological sites. In
total, five new archaeological sites, one scatter of
historic detritus, and one IF were documented
during the course of the DRPAA project
investigations (Table 1).

Beyond a 1-mile radius of the project area, two sites
(41HY201 and 41HY209) are worth mentioning.
Site 41HY201, situated on a high terrace south of
Onion Creek and west of Mustang Creek, is located
approximately 1.66 miles southeast of the DRPAA
and consists of a prehistoric open campsite
including debitage, as well as bifacial and unifacial
fragments (Atlas 2014). The Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) conducted extensive
data recovery investigations at the site, revealing
substantial Archaic and Late Prehistoric
components with well-preserved faunal and floral
remains (Ricklis and Collins 1994). Site 41HY209,
situated on the south bank of Mustang Branch
Creek, is located approximately 2.17 miles
southeast of the DRPAA. The site consists of a
prehistoric open campsite and burned rock midden
including flakes, cores, bifaces, and three early
side-notched dart points (Atlas 2014). According to
the site form, the site is eligible for inclusion in the
NRHP and for listing as an SAL (Atlas 2014).

The general setting can be characterized as a semirural ranching environment with expanding
residential and commercial development at the
western margin of Buda, Texas. More specifically,
the project area captures an environment with
gently sloped uplands, dissected by a single, nearly
central ephemeral drainage that runs generally
north to south, but scarcely shows signs of recent
flowing water. A single stock pond located
northwest of the center of the project area holds
water from the drainage (Figure 8).

The RTHL with a 1-mile radius of the project area
is for the Carpenter Log Home, a one-and-a half
story house of hewn cedar logs, built in 1865 by
Cyrus Milton Carpenter (1841-1922) (Atlas 2014).
The Methodist minister migrated to Hays County in
1854 and resided in the home with his wife
Charlotte Clayton (1850-1939) and their nine
children (Atlas 2014).

HISTORIC MAP REVIEW
The TxDOT historic overlay review of maps dating
to 1845, 1850, 1896, 1923 and 1958 did not identify
any historic-age resources documented within or
immediately adjacent to the project area (Foster et
al. 2006). The 1896 Austin USGS map depicts two
trails/roads in the southern portion of the project
area, which likely correlate with two-track roads
depicted further south on the current topo map
(Foster et al. 2006).

Figure 9. Machine-cleared area with pushpile
showing representative surface disturbances.

The property is largely unmodified, though
evidence of ranching and vegetation clearing can be
seen in certain areas. The most pervasive impact
observed within the project area is related to
selective clearing. Areas northeast of the stock pond
and at the extreme southern end of the project area
are void of large live oak and cedar elm trees, as are
common throughout most of the property, and are
dotted with young mesquite trees and show signs of
disturbance on the ground surface (Figure 9). The
impact of vegetation clearing, however, is likely
fairly shallow. Additional forms of disturbance
include construction of two-track roads, fence
construction around the boundary, and wild animal
and livestock activity.

As a general characterization of site expression and
integrity, the upland, lithic procurement sites cover
expansive areas where abundant chert cobbles are
present at the surface. Artifacts are found scattered
across almost the entire southern two-thirds of the
project area, with smaller, discrete artifact
concentrations where more intensive lithic
reduction occurred. These sites have relatively
shallow cultural deposition, to a maximum depth of
approximately 25 cm below surface.
41HY495
Site 41HY495 is a prehistoric lithic procurement
site that extends from the northwestern edge of the
property boundary across an upland hilltop, then
down the gradually sloping hillside, southeast
toward an ephemeral drainage where chert cobbles
are abundant. A two-track road meanders east to
west through the site. Most of the site area has been
selectively cleared and well cared for in its native
state, so vegetation consists primarily of native
grasses, mesquite, and scattered large oaks and
elms. Overall, roughly 20 to 50 percent of the
surface was visible at the time of survey.

Two of the five archaeological sites identified
within the project area have cultural material in
both surficial and buried contexts. Site types
include two prehistoric lithic procurement sites
(41HY495 and 41HY498,), two prehistoric lithic
scatters (41HY496 and 41HY497), and one historic
trash scatter (41HY499) (Figure 10).

The site boundary measures 290 m north-south by
310 m east-west, although investigation was limited
to the project area and the site likely extends to the
west and north. A total of 11 shovel tests were
excavated across the site, all of which were
negative for cultural material. Soils typically
consist of gravelly and cobbly brown to very dark
brown clay loam over thick reddish brown clay or
bedrock between 15–30 cm below surface. Shovel
tests were terminated due to either bedrock or preHolocene age (basal) clay.
Artifacts noted within the site area include large
primary flakes, tested cobbles, cores, secondary and
tertiary debitage, and crude bifacial tools (Figure
11). All of the artifacts encountered are made of
local parent material—brown to gray, very finegrained chert, known as Georgetown or Edwards
chert. No cultural features or temporally diagnostic
artifacts were encountered.

41HY495.
41HY496
Site 41HY496 is a prehistoric lithic scatter located
in the northeastern portion of the project area. The
site is located on a low, flat upland terrace adjacent
to an ephemeral drainage where chert cobbles are
abundant. Most of the site area has been selectively
cleared and well cared for in its native state, so
vegetation consists primarily of native grasses,
mesquite, and scattered (large) oaks and elms.
Overall, roughly 5 to 15 percent of the surface was
visible at the time of survey.

SUMMARY
Site 41HY495 is a prehistoric lithic procurement
site of unknown temporal affiliation. No cultural
features or temporally diagnostic artifacts were
encountered. This site was evaluated with regard to
SAL criteria and based on the relatively ubiquitous
nature of the site, a lack of subsurface integrity, and
the absence of cultural features or temporally
diagnostic artifacts, 41HY495 appears to have
limited integrity. SWCA recommends that the site
is not eligible for listing as an SAL and,
accordingly, no further archaeological work is
warranted. Should future work impact the areas to
the west of the current site boundary, pedestrian
inspection with shovel testing is recommended to
document the site extent beyond the limits of the
current project area.

The site boundary measures 170 m southwestnortheast by 75 m northwest-southeast, although
investigation was limited to the project area, and the
site likely extends to the south and east. A total of
seven shovel tests were excavated across the site,
one of which (AY12) was positive for cultural
material. As was the case on site 41HY495, soils
typically consist of gravelly and cobbly brown to
very dark brown clay loam over thick reddish
brown clay or bedrock between 15–30 cm below
surface. Shovel tests were terminated due to either
bedrock or pre-Holocene age (basal) clay.
Artifacts noted within the site area include large
primary flakes, tested cobbles, some secondary and
tertiary debitage, and one crude bifacial tool. In
general, artifact distribution is sparse across the
site. Due to limited surface visibility and general
lack of subsurface cultural deposits, most cultural
material accounted for was observed within a very

The site boundary measures 80 m north-south by 50
m east-west. The northern, eastern, and southern
boundaries were determined solely by the
distribution of artifacts across the bedrock surface.
Due to this exposure, no shovel tests were
excavated in those directions to delineate the site. A
total of three shovel tests were excavated on the
western side of the site, all of which were negative
for cultural material. Soils within the shovel tests
are typical of those found elsewhere within the
upland portion of the project area, consisting of
gravelly and cobbly reddish brown to reddish gray
clay loam over thick reddish brown clay or bedrock
between 15–30 cm below surface. Shovel tests were
terminated due to either pre-Holocene age (basal)
clay or limestone bedrock.

few exposed areas of eroded soil or bedrock. All of
the artifacts encountered are made of local parent
material—brown to gray, very fine-grained chert,
known as Edwards chert. No cultural features or
temporally diagnostic artifacts were encountered.
SUMMARY
Site 41HY496 is a prehistoric lithic scatter of
unknown temporal affiliation. Most cultural
material was observed within eroded areas, and no
cultural features or temporally diagnostic artifacts
were encountered. This site was evaluated with
regard to SAL criteria and based on the relatively
ubiquitous nature of the site, a lack of integrity, and
the absence cultural features or temporally
diagnostic artifacts, 41HY496 is not recommended
as eligible for designation as an SAL. No further
archaeological work or avoidance measures are
warranted. Should future work impact the areas to
the south or east of the current site boundary,
pedestrian inspection with shovel testing is
recommended to document the site extent beyond
the limits of the current project area.

Artifacts noted within the site area include large
primary flakes, tested cobbles, cores, some
secondary and tertiary debitage, and crude bifacial
tools. Cultural material was observed largely within
a concentric area within the site where wild hogs
had exposed much of the ground surface through
rooting (See Figure 12), however artifacts were
found more sparsely dispersed outside the area of
concentration. All of the artifacts encountered are
made of local parent material—brown to gray, very
fine-grained chert, known as Edwards chert. No
cultural features or temporally diagnostic artifacts
were encountered.

41HY497
Site 41HY497 is a prehistoric lithic scatter located
in the north-central portion of the project area. The
site sits within an area wooded with mature oaks,
elms, and juniper trees. There is a vast disturbed
area just west of the site that, combined with
negative shovel test data, forms the western
boundary of the site. Overall, roughly 5 to 20
percent of the surface was visible at the time of
survey, much of which consists of exposed
bedrock. Some of the surface visibility is due to
extensive hog rooting in areas of very shallow soils
above bedrock.

the artifacts encountered are made of local parent
material—brown to gray, very fine-grained chert,
known as Georgetown or Edwards chert. No
cultural features or temporally diagnostic artifacts
were encountered within the site. Investigators
recorded three areas of much greater artifact density
within the site. These areas indicate more intensive
lithic reduction activity than was observed across
the majority of the site. Additionally, archaeologists
recorded an isolated location where two large chert
nodules, still embedded in limestone bedrock, have
been flaked or partially reduced in situ. Adjacent to
the nodules sat an early-stage biface of identically
colored chert, and a lithic core of a different colored
chert.

SUMMARY
Site 41HY497 is a prehistoric lithic scatter site of
unknown temporal affiliation. An occasional
concentration of cultural material was identified,
but no clearly discernible intact activity areas could
be defined. No cultural features or temporally
diagnostic artifacts were encountered. This site was
evaluated with regard to SAL criteria, and based on
the relatively ubiquitous nature of the site, a lack of
subsurface integrity, and the absence cultural
features or temporally diagnostic artifacts,
41HY497 appears to have limited integrity. SWCA
recommends that the site is not eligible for listing
as an SAL and, accordingly, no further
archaeological work is warranted. However, due to
the nature of public access proposed for the project
area, SWCA does recommend that the whole of this
site be preserved through some form of inclusion or
education within the plans for park infrastructure.
41HY498
Site 41HY498 is a prehistoric lithic procurement
site that encompasses the entire southern half of the
project area. The site spans north to south across the
base of two gradual slopes and an ephemeral
drainage that meanders generally north to south
across the project area. The drainage channel floor
is covered in chert cobbles of various sizes. Surface
visibility across the site ranges from approximately
5 to 20 percent.

Figure 13. Example of early stage debitage found
on site surface.

The site boundary measures approximately 930 m
north-south by 1,100 m east-west as defined by the
extent of surface artifacts, project boundary to the
west, south, and east. A total of 60 shovel tests were
excavated within the site, 11 of which were positive
for cultural material to a maximum depth of 25
cmbs. Soils consist of dark yellowish brown sandy
clay loam and clay loam that overlies shallow
compact clay and clay loam or bedrock. Shovel
tests were terminated due to either pre-Holocene
age (basal) clay or limestone bedrock.

Site 41HY498 is a prehistoric lithic procurement
site of unknown temporal affiliation. No cultural

(See Figure 10). Should future work impact the
areas to the west, east, or south of the current site
boundary, pedestrian inspection with shovel testing
is recommended to document the site extent beyond
the limits of the current project area.

Artifacts noted within the site area include a saddle
cinch buckle, gate hinge plate, pulley wheel, and
other miscellaneous metal (Figure 15), as well as
cobalt and amethyst glass shards, a clear glass jar
base, and historic ceramic whiteware sherds (Figure
16). Diagnostic aspects of the artifacts indicate an
early to mid-twentieth century occupation.
Artifacts appear to be washed from denser
concentration located outside the project area. The
artifacts are in a secondary context, moving
downslope in the minor drainage. No historic
structures or other historic features were observed
within the site boundaries.

41HY499
Site 41HY499 is a sparse surface scatter of historic
twentieth century artifacts randomly distributed
within a shallow headwater wash that flows
westward towards an upland tributary of Onion
Creek (Figure 14). In addition to the effects of the
wash, there is heavy disturbance from recent
vegetation clearing to make a wide path for cattle to
frequent a modern metal watering tank on the
southern edge of the site. The cattle activity
contributes greatly to the disturbance of the site.
41HY499 is located near the base of a gradual slope
leading up to Carpenter Hills approximately 930 m
to the west. The surface is cobbly and heavily
disturbed by vegetation clearing and cattle. Sparse,
patchy grasses and scrubby mesquite grow across
the area, and a single, large oak tree stands on the
western end of the site. Surface visibility across the
site ranges from approximately 75 to 100 percent.

SUMMARY
Site 41HY499 is a sparse surface scatter of historic
twentieth century artifacts randomly distributed
within a shallow wash. No historic structures or
other historic features were observed. The recorded
site is part of a larger site that extends beyond the
survey area. Pending an evaluation of the larger
context with which the artifacts are associated, the
eligibility for SAL designation is undetermined.
While the recorded materials lack integrity and are
relatively sparse, they may contribute to a larger
assemblage that provides insights into the historic
Dahlstrom Ranch. Avoidance is recommended.

The site boundary measures approximately 10 m
north-south by 20 m east-west as defined by the
extent of surface artifacts and project boundary to
the east, and the drainage to the west. No shovel
tests were excavated within the site due to the high

A background review determined that the project
area is not known to have been previously
surveyed,
and
no
previously
recorded
archaeological sites are within the DRPAA (Atlas
2014). One archaeological site and SAL
(41HY448) and one RTHL (Carpenter Log Home)
are recorded within a 1-mile radius of the project
area (Atlas 2014). Neither have components within
or immediately adjacent to the project area.

ISOLATED FIND
In addition to the five archaeological sites
documented during survey, SWCA archaeologists
encountered one Isolated Find (IF01).
IF01 consisted of one secondary chert flake
fragment within shovel test MC12, at a depth of 0–
25 cm below surface. Eight shovel tests were
excavated to the north, south, east, and west to
delineate the isolated find, however all eight of
those tests were negative for cultural material, thus
not warranting recording the find as an
archaeological site.

The TxDOT historic overlay review of maps dating
to 1845, 1850, 1896, 1923 and 1958 did not identify
any historic-age resources documented within or
immediately adjacent to the project area (Foster et
al. 2006). The 1896 Austin USGS map depicts two
trails/roads in the southern portion of the project
area, which likely correlate with two-track roads
depicted further south on the current topographic
map (Foster et al. 2006).

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On behalf of Hays County, using funds
administered by TPWD, SWCA conducted
intensive cultural resources survey of the proposed
360-acre Dahlstrom Ranch Public Access Area,
located approximately 4 miles west of Buda in
northeastern Hays County, Texas. Although the
land is privately owned, compliance with the
Antiquities Code of Texas is a requisite attached to
Texas Parks and Wildlife funding (Texas
Recreation Trails Fund grant) and Hays County’s
status as a political subdivision of the state. All
work was conducted in accordance with the
standards and guidelines of the CTA and THC’s
minimum survey standards under Texas Antiquities
Permit No. 7035.

Field identification efforts relied on common
surface exposures and shovel testing. The survey
revealed five archaeological sites situated in
shallow rocky upland soils. Cultural material was
largely limited to surficial and shallow contexts,
and disturbance due to natural processes (e.g.,
bioturbation, slopewash, colluvial creep).
As a result of these investigations, a total of five
archaeological sites were documented—four of
which are prehistoric lithic procurement sites and
one is a twentieth century historic site. The
prehistoric sites (41HY495, 41HY498, 41HY496,

21

and 41HY497) are all surficial lithic scatters and
lithic procurement sites, exhibiting little to no
integrity or subsurface cultural deposits and no
evidence of prehistoric habitation (e.g., features
such as hearths of middens). As a result of poor
integrity, lack of deposition, unsubstantial
assemblages, and the lack of dateable materials, the
prehistoric sites are not recommended as eligible as
SALs. The prehistoric sites are nevertheless
informative and can be incorporated into the
scientific, educational, and recreational purposes of
the park. Accordingly, Figure 10 shows several
areas where lithic reduction activities and natural
outcrops are most evident and dense, allowing
opportunities for observation and education.
The historic site (41HY499) is a random surface
scatter of twentieth century artifacts in a disturbed
and secondary context within a shallow, washedout area. The artifacts appear to be related to a
possible historic dump located beyond the survey
area. Accordingly, the artifacts within the survey
area recorded as 41HY499 represent a component
to a larger site. While the recorded component lacks
integrity, the site’s SAL eligibility is recommended
as undetermined pending a further assessment of
the larger context and associations. Avoidance is
recommended.
One prehistoric isolated find was recorded in the
project area. Investigations around the isolated find
indicated no association with other cultural
materials or an archaeological site.
