University study under way

Certification Survey seeks
clues to guide OAS future
Reorganizing the Oklahoma Anthropological Society’s Certification Program will be guided by
a study under way at the University of Oklahoma.
Graduate student Holly Andrew is conducting the research in two parts, surveys and focus
groups. The study title is “Engaging With Citizen
Archaeologists in Oklahoma.”
Her goal is to contact as many current or
previous OAS members as possible. She will identify the needs and goals of avocational archeologists about OAS certification.
“The survey, which has been administered
via mail and an online site, is to help identify key
themes and experiences OAS members have had

Trowel Marks
The OAS has gone
through a lot of changes
this past year, and more are
expected.
Most of you know
that as of January 2014,
OAS Trowel Marks newsletter goes digital. This decision was not easy. However
at this time, it is a feasible
step if OAS is to be fiscally
sound.
Some of you have
asked if the OAS Memoirs
and annual Bulletins are
also to become electronic.
The Board has discussed
this option and at present,
there are no plans to change
those publishing formats.
***
Those of you who want
to receive a printed newsletter have the opportunity to
get it in a hard copy format,
just at an additional cost.
The Membership Subscription Form has an itemized
line addressing the request
for a print version of Trowel
Marks. We’ve tried to keep
the cost low for that option.
For those getting
the newsletter in its new
electronic format, please
don’t forget to include your
email address on your Membership Form. Of course, if
your email address changes, please let OAS know.
Contact Membership Chair
Elsbeth Dowd.

The OAS has had a
very exciting and busy year.
The Fall Activity involved a
survey at OAS members

I would like to thank
Scott and Jean for letting us
survey the property. I would

also like to thank Robert

expertise and supervision.
None of this could
happen without them.
***
Most importantly, as
most of you know, we are

in the process of revamping the OAS Certification
Program. This is not going
to be an easy project. Our
first step is to hear from the
members of the Society. We
cannot move forward with
this challenge if we don’t
get feedback about past
certification.
Holly Andrew, a anthropology graduate student
at the University of Oklahoma, has been asked by the
OAS to conduct research
on how to revitalize the program. She has graciously
agreed.
The first step is a
survey. Holly generated it to
get feedback from you as a
member of the Society.
You should have received the survey by now in

please let us know. You can
contact Holly at h.l.andrew@

Also important: Keep
in mind that this is also her
master’s thesis in anthropology. OAS member participation is extremely vital
to her as well as us.
Finally, remember, it
is time to renew your OAS
membership. We have a
very exciting year ahead!

Roberts Ranch Survey

Wood has an interest.”
Wood is the historical archeologist at the Oklahoma Historic Preservation office. She joined the field
survey and reviewed the Cockrell building with OAS
members.
Contacted at the Oklahoma History Center, she
said she is working on a report on the old house and its
relevance to state history (see story Page 5).
The 2013 Field Survey is the first for OAS since
2005. At that time members walked the Nickel Family
Nature and Wildlife Preserve near Tahlequah. Also led
by Dr. Brooks, the effort turned up historic and native
American evidence.
The Roberts Ranch Survey was different in several ways, Dr. Brooks said.

A.D. Neal moved back to the house after his wife passed away in 1947. He lived there
until about 1955 when he returned to Cushing
because of ill health.
So far the ranch reveals little of archeological interest, Dr. Brooks said. That could

Signs of a secret society?

Century-old house yields
few clues about its builder

Over a century ago Samuel Cockrell built a fine two-story
ranch house on the rolling Oklahoma prairie near Cushing.
He inscribed his name and the date on a lintel above the
right second floor window. He also placed a half-moon and two stars
on a lintel above a window on the left.
Therein lies a mystery, say property owners Scott and Jean
Roberts.
Last November they were hosts to an Oklahoma Anthropological Society survey. About 20 volunteers walked the ranch, looking for a well, schoolhouse, and dugout. They paced the yard around
the old house. The inscribed moon and stars raised curiosity.
“I think they represent the Knights of the Golden Circle,”
Scott said. Some years ago Civil War reenactors told the Roberts
they recognized the symbols as a secret society supporting a Confederate uprising after the Civil War.
“We were told that was their emblem” Scott Roberts said.
Or maybe not.
Cate Wood, archeologist with the State
Historic Preservation
office, links gender
to the symbols. She

of with a name inscribed.”
Archeologist Cate Wood identifies the house
design as gothic revival with a subcategory of centered gable.
“This category appears in over one-third of
all gothic revival houses,” she said when contacted at
her office at the Oklahoma History Center.
Local sandstone was moved to the building site. Masons shaped it by hand into rectangular blocks. Scott Roberts said he’s had an offer to
tear down the structure in exchange for the historic
stone.
“I said ‘No,’ he said. “Besides, I’d like to restore the house if I can find a way to afford it.”
While the two brick fireplaces are intact, the
roof is falling, floors are breaking through, interior
walls are shaky. The west exterior block wall is bowing out, a victim of recent earthquakes.
Yet roses and irises are thriving in the front
yard, touching reminders of a house once cared for
and loved.

school.
Dr.
Hammerstedt
may know in January if he
needs more volunteers, possibly some from the Oklahoma Anthropological Society,
he said.
Research at the site
dates to the 1930s. More
recent archeological work
at Spiro started in October
2011. Researchers from the
Oklahoma
Archeological
Survey, OU Anthropology
Department, and Arkansas
Archeological Survey conducted a near-surface geophysical survey.
Their joint effort started
a multi-disciplinary project
aimed at understanding the
internal organization of the
archeological park.
Researchers think
they know a lot about what
was in the mounds, but not
elsewhere. Less than 15
percent of the site has been
tested.

Magnetometers and
other electronic devices have
allowed the team to search
underground Spiro.
Despite the distraction of objects left by historic
occupation, as many as 70
prehistoric structures have
been singled out.
To get permission to
dig, the team formed a cooperative venture with the Army
Corps of Engineers, the Caddo and Wichita tribes, and
the State Historic Preservation Office.
Hammerstedt said the
geophysical survey is proving very helpful. Even though
it measures anomalies with
as much as 1 cm accuracy,
it takes digging to be certain
what appears on a readout is
what you get from a shovel
and trowel.
In the current work at
Spiro, “It’s matching up nicely,” Dr. Hammerstedt said.
Photographs of October’s research are displayed
at www.facebook.com/spirolandcapeproject.

Excavators wield shovels and trowels during an October

Treasurer job is open

OAS Board, chapters
have challenges ahead
Several key changes
are under way on the Oklahoma Anthropological Society Board, said President
Debra Baker. Some OAS
chapters also report new developments.
In the state organization, Treasurer Cathy Compton stepped down in January.
The position is important and
needs immediate filling, Baker said.
Dot Linn stepped down
as Membership Chair. Els-

beth Dowd accepted the position “and we really do appreciate her,” Baker said at
the Fall Meeting in Norman.
With the death of Tom
Purdin, a Director-At-Large
position opened. Archeologist
Bob Blasing, Oklahoma City,
agreed to fill the vacancy.
Connie Masters also
has stepped down to leave a
vacant Director-At-Large position, as has Phil Marshala.
OAS Chapters report
several changes. Arkoma

the second Tuesday of each
month at Mercy Hospital,
Ada. Carl Gilley is Chapter
President and Representative.
Central, Cleveland
County, Lawton and Kay
County chapters are active
with regular meetings.
McAlester and Tahlequah need new officers. The
death of Tom Purdin has left
the president’s office vacant
in both chapters.
McAlester and Tahlequah Chapters Vice President Connie Masters has

stepped down. Attendance
at both groups has been
minimal, Masters said. She
is uncertain if she can find
replacements for officers to
lead the groups.
The new Stillwater
Chapter has low attendance,
said President Alisa Hines.
She hopes a newspaper article will draw new members.
Stillwater meets at 7 p.m.
the third Thursdays of each
month at First Presbyterian
Church.
Tulsa Archaeological
Society has occasional meetings, said Chapter Representative Pam Proctor. Instead,
the group takes field trips, the
latest to Spiro Mounds. Paul
Roberts, Tulsa, is President.

Natural History Museum adds archeologist as collections manager
A Georgia collections manager
has been hired as the new Archeology
Collection Manager at Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History in Norman.
Susan “Susie” Fishman-Armstrong joined the staff Dec. 2. Elsbeth
Dowd held the position until her promotion
to Museum Registrar last spring.
Fishman-Armstrong is a native of
Kansas City. She earned her MA in Museum Science at Texas Tech University in
Lubbock, Texas and her BS in Geology at
Fort Hays University in Kansas.
Until her move to Oklahoma she
was Curator of Collections at the Antonio
J. Waring Jr. Archaeological Laboratory at

the University of West Georgia, Carrollton, Ga. She held the position for
13 years. In that capacity she directed
collections management, registration,
and education outreach.
She also was volunteer coordinator
for students and from the community.
Fishman-Armstrong looks forward to managing a large, diverse collection at the natural history museum,
she said.
“There will be some new opportunities in collaboration. I love working with people in many departments
and from the community. I’m looking
forward to seeing what new things we
can be doing.”

Arapaho Women’s
Quillwork: Motion, Life,
and Creativity
By Jeffery D. Anderson
Published 2013 by OU 		
Press
Hardcover 216 Pgs $35.96
ISBN 978-0-8061-4283-8
– Review by Kathy Gibbs
This book is the first comprehensive examination of
quillwork within the Arapaho
ritualized traditions. It is more
than a book on quillwork – it
is also about Arapaho women
and spiritual traditions.
Quillwork art was
neither just decorative nor
merely complementary to
men’s art forms and ceremonies. Arapaho women
maintained a ceremonial order for porcupine quillwork
artistry that was at the very
heart of religious practices,
an ultimate concern for life,
a sense of beauty, and identity as human beings. It was
more “art,” as art is framed by
Western traditions.
Within each type of ceremonial quillwork, Arapaho
women artists created a
fixed number of styles and
patterns. There were different types of shapes, designs, and ornaments – each
ranked on its antiquity, value,
complexity, and time committed. Important also was color,
shape, and proportions.
Unlike secular art
forms, Arapaho women valued quillwork projects not for
themselves but as gifts that

life: childhood, youth, adulthood, and old age.
Quillwork as gifts
moved on pathways of symbolic exchange among kin
and between kin groups. At
the basic level, quillwork was
a product of ritually controlled
repetitive women’s movement, primarily coordinating
eyes and hands for placing,
proportioning, and shaping
quills. It was a form of controlled body motion and vision.
This book is divided
into sections. The introduction (26 pages) and the last
two chapters, The Movement
of Quillwork in History and
the Conclusion, explain more
of the history of the Arapaho
people. The middle chapters
describe the different quilled
objects within the tribe’s culture.
Chapters 1-6 explain
in great detail the different
designs, patterns, and objects quilled.
Arapaho women quillwork
was also tied to the agegrade system and figured
significantly in sacred paraphernalia for the Sun Dance,
Buffalo Lodge, and men’s
age-grade lodges.
The majority of quilled

items were acquired during the most difficult time
period (1880-1910’s) by
collectors, missionaries,
military officers, government officials and tourists – many purchased
at very cheap prices. The
irony is that at the time
people were gathering
Native American art to
demonstrate the aesthetic wealth among human
kind, tribes were experiencing the worst material
conditions and poverty
they had ever known.
To summarize:
Quillwork began as a sacred tradition central to
Arapaho culture. Women gave away quillwork
to generate a long and
straight life for relatives
and the tribe.
This book is full of so
much researched information that it is difficult to read
other than a few pages at a
time. The introduction and
last two chapters on history
were to me the only interesting parts. The minute details
of the quillwork items would
not be interesting to the average reader.
This book is meant
more for someone doing research and needing intricate
details of the objects.

Spider Woman's Daughter
By Anne Hillerman
Hardcover, 320 Pgs, $17.90
Published 2013 by Harper
Collins
ISBN 0062270486
-- Review by Jon Denton
Anybody bold enough
to tread in novelist Tony Hillerman’s footsteps deserves
praise for courage. That the
writer is Anne Hillerman, his
daughter, is encouraging
and, it turns out, rewarding.
The late Tony Hillerman, Oklahoma-born master

storyteller, developed a loyal
readership with his many
Navajo novels. Set in New
Mexico, his tales followed
Navajo Nation police officers
Lt. Joe Leaphorn and his understudy, Sgt. Jim Chee. In
recent years he developed
the role of Officer Bernadette
Manuelito for a softer side of
police work.
Anne Hillerman comes
by her writing chops on her
own. Her cookbook, "Santa
Fe Flavors: Best Restaurants
and Recipes" won the 2009
New Mexico Book Award
for the best cookbook of the
year.
In 2010 she released
“Gardens of Santa Fe.” Before that she wrote "Children's Guide to Santa Fe."
In the Tony Hillerman
books, there’s usually an archeological angle. Anne Hillerman follows suit with ample
attention to a museum and
an insider’s view of Navajo
culture.
In this case we learn
something about Navajo
weaving and the great reverence (and value) it inspires.
The story centers on
the shooting of the legendary
Lt. Leaphorn and a search for
his assailant. Officer Manuelito steps up, even though
she’s a witness to the crime.
After she’s removed from the
case, her husband Sgt. Chee
is put in charge.
But the stubborn of(Continued next page)

ficer won’t give up hunting for
the shooter, especially since
she’s so fond of her “uncle,”
Lt. Leaphorn.
It’s fair to say the
author is not yet up to her
father’s standards. Her book
plods along at times and the
plotting is visibly contrived.
Yet she’s on track with the
desert settings and characters. She relights the Hillerman flame.
Let’s hope she keeps
it going.

The Dig: In Search of 		
Coronado’s Treasure
By Sheldon Russell
University of Oklahoma
Press 2013
Paperback 238 Pgs, $13.96
ISBN 978-0-8061-4360-6
-- Review by Jon Denton
Fantasy, fact and fiction do a little dance in Sheldon Russell’s latest novel.
This time he entwines the
stories of Coronado’s search
for treasure, a broke and outof-luck archeology graduate
student (from the University
of Oklahoma, no less), and a
Kansas graveyard where he
learns some secrets are revealed at great danger.
Russell has the right
pedigree for the theme. He is
a former public school English teacher. He retired as a
professor emeritus from the
University of Central Okla-

homa in 2000.
Readers might be
familiar with Russell’s previous work. Perhaps Dreams
to Dust: A Tale of the Oklahoma Land Rush is his best
known. It was named an Official Oklahoma Centennial
Project. His The Insane Train
(Hook Runyon #2) was selected as one of the six best
mysteries of 2010 by Publishers Weekly.
No less a novelist than
Oklahoman William Bernhardt congratulates Russell
by saying “The Dig is that
rarest of literary artifacts — a
historical novel that informs
while weaving a spellbinding
narrative.”
As the book jacket says,
nothing’s going right for OU
archeology student Jim Hunt.
He’s out of money, his petulant wife abandons him and
his infant daughter, and he’s
got to get field experience or
he’ll lose his scholarship.
Here Russell pulls in
the familiar tale of Spanish
explorer and conquistador
Francisco Vázquez de Coronado. Led across the grass
plains by the Turk, Coronado seeks gold but finds
treachery. Good research, a
little imagination and a some
humor make Coronado’s
search credible and keeps it
moving. It also ties nicely into
the modern story.
In a small Kansas
town Hunt finds himself in a
tangle with a historical mystery and a murder investigation. He gets help and sympathy from Eva, an attractive
museum curator. But as he
digs in, he irritates the sheriff
and is warned off by a mausoleum caretaker. From there
the tension ratchets as his
story and that of Coronado
bump to a climax.
Russell is an apt storyteller. His characters are
credible if not always dramatic. His latest novel is worth
reading and passing on to a
friend who also enjoys archeology.

Purdin was a Civil War reenactor,
taking the role of a major in the Confederate army, although he also performed
as a Union soldier when needed. He participated in reenactments at the Gettysburg battlefield site in Pennsylvania.
He was a sutler, selling apparel
and equipment at Oklahoma pioneer

he created bone handled, flint chipped
knives that were as rugged as they were
attractive.
