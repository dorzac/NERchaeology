Abstract
Flatrock Enginering and Environmental, Ltd. of San Antonio, Texas contracted with Tierras
Antiguas Archaeological Investigations to conduct a cultural resources linear survey of the
Crossroads Lateral right-of-way in Martin County, Texas. The Area of Potential Effect is 9.3 miles
long x 80 feet wide, for a total of 90.2 acres. The entire right-of-way will cross publicly owned
properties, and the entire project is privately funded; thus no state Antiquities Permit was required.
In addition, there are no U.S. Army Corps of Engineers jurisdictional areas.
The field survey was conducted by four archaeologists on April 13, 2015. Otherwise, shallow and
eroded soils were exposed in plowed agricultural fields along roughly 90 percent of the right-ofway. In addition, the small drainages observed were shallow, broad, and ephemeral, with little or
no evidence of terrace building.
During the course of the survey, no evidence of either prehistoric or historic cultural materials was
observed. In addition, no potentially historic structures were observed along the periphery of the
right-of-way. Accordingly, the project should be considered as having “no effect” on any
properties considered as eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places or
inclusion in the State Archeological Landmarks Program, and as such, the project should be
allowed to proceed without further archaeological work. However, if any cultural resources are
encountered during construction, work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such
finds are examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological
consultant, and by the Texas Historical Commission.
No artifacts were collected and curated during this project.

Acknowledgments
There are mainly three individuals who are greatly appreciated, and whose efforts contributed to
the successful planning, organization, and completion of this project. They are Mr. Wade Ingle,
Senior Partner at Flatrock Engineering and Environmental, Ltd., and Ms. Judy Vader, and Mr.
Brannon Norton, Project Managers at Flatrock Engineering and Environmental, Ltd. All were
extremely amiable and helpful throughout the project, and their overall knowledge of the project
contributed significantly to our understanding of the project’s scope of work.
It was indeed a pleasure working with Contract Land Specialists Karry Phillips, Right-of-Way
Supervisor, and Pete Taorminio, Right-of-way Agent at Navigator Energy Services, LLC from
their office in Big Spring.
Another individual who was extremely helpful in the completion of this report is Joel Butler who
masterfully created the map overlays presented. In addition, I very much relied upon Crew Chief
David (Emory) Worrell, and archaeological Field Technicians Belisario Silva and Steven Schooler
with Tierras Antiguas. They are dedicated individuals, and as always, these three “hosses” worked
meticulously to ensure all aspects of this investigation were thoroughly documented in accordance
with Texas Historical Commission and Council of Texas Archeologists standards.

Introduction
Navigator Energy
Services, LLC of
Big Spring, Texas
is the lead agency
for the Crossroads
Lateral that is
proposed for
construction
through privately
owned properties
in eastern Martin
County,
in
northwestern
Texas (Figures 15).
Navigator Energy
Services in turn

and cultural
assessments would be conducted in a professional compliance manner. At the request of Flatrock,
Tierras Antiguas Archaeological Investigations (TAAI) conducted a cultural resources survey of
the Project Area (PA) during the period April 2 and 3, 2015.
The project is privately funded, and will cross privately owned properties; thus no Texas
Antiquities permit was required, and there are no stream crossings under the jurisdiction of the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The survey was conducted under the guidelines of the Texas
Historical Commission (THC) and Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA).

Project Setting
Geology
As shown in Figure 6, the Crossroads Lateral will cross over and through five geological
formations (Barnes 1994; Judson and Kaufman 1990):
Antler sand (Ka) is a component of the Edwards Group and Antlers Sand Undivided Formation
of Lower Cretaceous age. It consists of as much as 500 feet of silty to sandy mudstones, fine- to
coarse grained sandstones that are poorly to moderately sorted and cemented with clay or calcium
carbonate. In places the sandstone may be conglomeratic or ferruginous.
Edwards Limestone (Ked) formed during the Lower Cretaceous, over 66 million years ago. It
ranges from 300 to 500 feet in thickness. Notably the Edwards Formation consists of medium gray
to grayish brown, fine to coarse-grained chert in abundance.

5

The Ogallala Formation (PoMo) formed during the Pliocene and Miocene Epochs within the
Tertiary Period, and is made up of sand, silt, clay, and gravel. These underlying deposits are
capped with hard caliche several feet thick that is clearly observed on the eroding caprock
canyonlands. Gravels where present, are comprised of localized quartz and quartzite lenses,
sandstone, limestone, chert, igneous, and metamorphic rocks. These gravels, along with
surrounding sediments and soils are commonly found in the eroded lower canyonlands.
The Blackwater Draw Formation (Qbd) is slightly younger than the Ogallala Formation, forming
during the early Pleistocene Epoch, and early Quaternary Period. Eolian in nature, it consists of
fine-grained quartz, silty loams and clay loams found on upland areas in this area of northwest
Texas (Holliday 1989).
The final formation mapped along the Crossroads Lateral right-of-way is the Tahoka Formation
(Qta), formed during the early Pleistocene. It is comprised of lacustrine clay, silt, sand and gravels,
including fine to coarse-grained quartz.

Soils
As shown in Figures 7-9, the Crossroads Lateral will dissect 11 different soil types that are of
varying depths, resulting primarily from eolian processes, but also alluvial processes on the
extreme western end, as well as the extreme eastern end near Sulphur Springs Draw. As such,
these various soil classifications otherwise imply the potential for the preservation of intact
cultural resources to exist (Stoner and Dixon 1974; Websoil Survey 2015).Our assessment of these
soils to encapsulate deeply buried and intact cultural materials are then presented in Table 1.

Elevations, Rivers, and Streams
Elevations above mean sea level (amsl) in Martin County range from roughly 2,100 to 2,800 feet.
The northern portion of the county consists of nearly level and gently sloping plains, giving way
to steep and broken plains on the edge of the Edwards Plateau in the southern portion of the county.
The major drainages are the North Concho River, as well as Morgan and Wild Horse creeks (Long
1996; Stoner et al. 1969)
Flora, Fauna, and Climate
The Project Area lies within the North Central Plains physiographic region of Texas (Figure 9).
within the Great Plains region. However, the Project Area lies just below the High Plains area, near
the Caprock escarpment. The High Plains are highest in their southern most portion, on the Llano
Estacado Caprock, with elevations reaching over 3,200 ft above mean sea level (amsl). Running
from the northern portion of the Texas Panhandle southward into Central Texas, the Caprock
escarpment forms an abrupt boundary between the flat Llano Estacado and the deeply incised and
rapidly eroding Caprock Canyonlands along its eastern edge. The Caprock Canyonlands become
less rugged and incised as the southeasterly flowing rivers broaden their valleys, and enter the
Lower Plains region, encompassing generally rolling, low hills and ridges (Boyd 1995; Parsons
1967; Carroll 1996). The topography of the Project Area is generally typified by an undulating
nearly level to rolling landscape with predominately rangelands on loamy and dry soils. However,
portions of the Project Area in Martin County lie at the eastern tip of the Permian Basin, at the
southeastern edge of the Llano Estacado Caprock, and near the western edge of the Edwards
Plateau.

As shown in Figure 11,
the Project Area is
situated in the
southern-most portion
of the Kansan Biotic
Province as described
by Blair (1950). The
Kansas Province
includes the Permian
redbeds region south of
the Red River, east of
t h e Hi gh P l ai ns
escarpment, and west
of the Edwards
Plateau. The Permian
red plains consist of
open mesquite
savanna. Grasslands
are prevalent, with
mixed grasses such as
beardgrass, several
species of grama, and
buffalo grass. These
mesquite plains further
ex hibit areas of
mesquite mottes and a
few other shrubs,
interspersed by large
areas of grasses, as
well as forbs such as
b r o o m w e e d a n d Figure 9. Physiographic Regions of Texas (2014).
gaillardia. Interspersed
are also shin-oak and sand sage.
However, the Kansan Province is drained by numerous rivers and intermittent lesser streams that
allow for larger trees such as oak, elms, hackberries, and maples to survive and thrive. Understory
cedars are also prominent in such environs. At least 59 mammal species have been catalogued
within the Kansan Province, as well as land turtles, 14 species of lizards, and 31 snake species.
The modern climate of the Project Area is classified as semi-arid, with an average annual rainfall
of roughly 16 to 20 inches. Large fluctuations in temperature occur throughout the year, with
average daily maximum temperatures averaging about 960F in July, to around 290F degrees in

10

January. The
combination of
variable rainfall
and temperature
patterns results in
frequent droughts
as well as sporadic
periods
of
abundant moisture,
resulting in a
growing season of
roughly 214-217
days (Long 1996).

Cultural Context and Chronology
The Project Area presumes cultural affinities both indigenous to the western edge of the northcentral Texas region as well as intrusive influences from the Southern Great Plains (Figure 11).
Several scholars have offered sound but differing arguments for cultural chronologies for the
Southern Great Plains extending into northern Texas. The cultural chronology, defined by complex
(in lieu of the terms phase, interval, or period) of the North American High Plains has been
synthesized by Hofman et al. (1989), and more recently, the Southern High Plains in Texas by
Johnson and Holliday (1995) and Boyd (1995). It should be noted that the Southern Great Plains
complexes are defined by shifts in climatic conditions and subsistence more so than changes in
point style, which are indicators of change in central and south Texas. The following discussions
are primarily derived from Johnson and Holliday (1986, 1995), Boyd (1995), and Hofman et al.
(1989). All dates are approximate and given as years before present (B.P.).
11

Pre-Clovis
Although humans may
h a v e i n h a b it e d t h e
landscape before 11,500
B.P, solid evidence does
not support their existence.
Although human behavior
is inferred on stone
artifacts from mammoth
bones at the Waco Site
(Fox et al. 1992:51-73), all
are problematic. At
Lewisville Lake on the
Southern High Plains of
n o rt h -central Tex as,
radiocarbon dates initially
believed to be from burned
charcoal in human
campfires,
and
approximating an antiquity
of 40,000 years were later
disproved as dates on
natural coal (Stanford
1982:208-209).
Figure 11. Map of Texas Archaeological Regions (adapted from
Black 1989).
As Collins (1995:380-381)
offers, eroded landforms are not likely to yield solid stratigraphic proof of human occupation earlier
than late Pleistocene, and if we do find earlier occupations on stable landforms, what comprises the
signature of a Pre-Clovis culture? The Gault Site in Bell County, Texas has provided by far the
largest Clovis assemblage in all of North America, and with artifacts stratigraphically beneath the
known Clovis component, likely has the best chances of providing conclusive evidence for a preClovis culture in Texas (Adavasio and Page 2002:292-294; Collins and Brown 2000; Gault Site
2014).
Paleoindian
The Paleoindian period began toward the close of the Pleistocene. The Southern Great Plains were
occupied by Clovis (Llano), Folsom and other complex peoples between approximately
11500-8000 B.P. (Hofman et al. 1989:29-45). During the Paleoindian interval, Hurt (1980) suggests
an association with the Southern Plains and Trans-Pecos regions. Diagnostic artifacts include
Clovis and Folsom projectile points. Certainly the wide distribution of Clovis-type points across
most of North America and even into Central America suggests a wide dispersal of the people who
made them. Within Texas' political boundaries, Meltzer and Bever (2007) have documented the
presence of over 500 Clovis points. Other artifacts associated with the Clovis culture include
bifaces and prismatic blades, engraved stones, bone and ivory points, stone bolas, ochre, and shaft
straighteners.
12

In general the Paleoindian adaptation has been considered to be one of small bands of nomadic,
big-game hunters following herds of Late Pleistocene fauna, including mammoth, mastodons,
bison, camel, and horse, across North America (Black 1989a). More recently, emphasis has been
placed on the wide diversity of plants and animals used for subsistence by these early Americans
(Black 1989a; Hester 1983), such as turtles and tortoises, alligators, mice, badgers, and raccoons
(Collins 1995:381), although they undoubtedly hunted the large animals as well (Dibble and
Lorraine 1968). Known Clovis sites include killsites, quarries, caches, open campsites, ritual sites,
and burials (Collins 1995: 381-383; Hester 1995:433-436). A Folsom interval follows the Clovis,
except perhaps in the Southern Great Plains where a transitional complex of artifacts with dart
points called “Goshen” may be present (Hofman et al. 1989:34; Irwin-Williams et al. 1973).
A well-documented Paleoindian Clovis site in the southern Great Plains is the McLean site in
Taylor County, west of Abilene (Ray and Bryan 1938; Sellards 1952). Folsom sites in the area
include the Scharbauer site in northwestern Midland County (Wendorf et al. 1955), and the
Adair-Steadman site in north central Nolan County (Tunnel 1977). A fourth site nearby containing
a Milnesand component is Lone Wolf Creek in northeastern Mitchell County (Wormington 1957).
By far, the most robust collection of Paleindian artifacts has been recovered at the Gault Site in Bell
County, Texas. Archaeologists estimate that over 2.3 million Paleoindian artifacts have been
recovered, with only about 3% of the site professionally excavated thus far (Gault Site 2014).
As the warming that marks the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene climates began to take
effect in Texas, prehistoric inhabitants adapted with changes in lifestyle. This climatic shift is also
marked by the decline and extinction of mammoth, mastodon, horse, camel, and giant bison (Bison
antiquus). With the possible exception of the Berclair Terrace site (Sellards 1940), archaeological
evidence suggests that after 8000 B.P., large gregarious game animals were either extinct or
otherwise extricated from Texas. Human hunters were forced to concentrate on deer, antelope, and
other medium-size or smaller game. Changes in the subsistence base required technological shifts
that mark the beginning of a new cultural period known as the Archaic.
Early Archaic
The Early Archaic on the Southern Great Plains is approximated at 8000-5000 B. P. (Hofman etal.
1989), although Johnson and Holliday (1986) offer more fine-grained dates for the Llano Estacado
from the Lubbock Lake site of 8500–6400 B.P. The extinction of large herds of megafauna and the
changing climate at the beginning of the Holocene stimulated a behavioral change by the
Prehistoric inhabitants of South Texas (McKinney 1981). While the basic hunter-gatherer
adaptation probably remained intact, an economic shift away from big game hunting was necessary.
In general, more intensive exploitation of local resources in central Texas, such as deer, fish, and
plant bulbs is indicated by greater densities of ground-stone artifacts, fire-cracked rock cooking
features, and more specialized tools such as Clear Fork gouges and Guadalupe bifaces (Turner et
al. 2011). Weir (1976) speculates that Early Archaic groups were small and highly mobile, an
inference from the fact that Early Archaic sites are thinly distributed and that diagnostic types are
seen across a wide area, including most of Texas and northern Mexico. Hurt (1980) suggests that
the decline in the number of bison on the plains forced the inhabitants to broaden their diets to
pursue plants and animals which would produce the same amount of calories and protein with the
13

same or slightly more effort expended. Using projectile points as temporal markers, Hurt (1980:vi)
argues that the Crossroads Lateral area was used more frequently in the Early Archaic than in the
Middle and Late Archaic, probably due to “decline of bison and other game animals on the
Southern Plains.” Story (1985), however, believes that population densities were low during this
period, and that groups consisted of related individuals in small bands with “few constraints on
their mobility” (Story 1985:39). Their economy was based on diffuse utilization of a wide range
of resources, especially such year-round resources as prickly pear and lechugilla, as well as rodents,
rabbits, and deer (Story 1985:38).
Middle Archaic
The Southern Plains Middle Archaic complex as derived from changes in climate and subsistence
is recognized generally as the period between 5000–3000 B.P. (Hofman et al. 1989:45-47), and
more specifically as 6400–4500 B.P. on the Llano Estacado (Johnson and Holliday 1986:46). The
Middle Archaic appears to have been a time of increased population, based on the large number
of sites from this period in south and central Texas (Story 1985:40; Weir 1976:125, 128). The
reasons for this increase are not known, but the amelioration of a very dry period (Altithermal)
during the Early Archaic is often seen as the prime mover (Sollberger and Hester 1972:338; Story
1985:40). A wide variation in projectile point styles at the Jonas Terrace site suggest "a time of
ethnic and cultural variety, as well as group movement and immigration." (Johnson 1995:285). Hurt
(1980) posits that the quantity of diversified game animals on the Southern Great Plains decreased,
and thus lead to an intensified, less broad diet. On the South Texas Plains, exploitation of widely
scattered, year-round resources such as prickly pear continued (Campbell and Campbell
1981:13-15), as did hunting deer and rabbit. However, a shift to concentrated, seasonal nut harvests
in the riverine environments of the Balcones Escarpment seems to have occurred (Black 1989a).
Weir (1976) believes that an expansion of oak on the Edwards Plateau and Balcones Escarpment
led to intensive plant gathering and acorn processing. He also believes that the widely scattered
bands prevalent in the Early Archaic now began to coalesce, at least during the acorn-gathering
season, into larger groups who shared the intensive work of gathering and processing the acorn
harvest (Weir 1976:126). Many researchers believe burned rock middens are a result of this
endeavor (Creel 1986; Prewitt 1991; Weir 1976). Other investigators doubt this conclusion (e.g.,
Goode 1991), but the exact processes which formed the burned rock middens are still a matter of
controversy (Black 1989b:28; Black et al. 1997; Hester 1991; Leach and Bousman 1998).
On the Edwards Plateau, they may have come together to gather acorns, and then built large
cooking ovens to steam the tanic acid out of them to make them edible (Weir 1976). The large
cooking ovens were apparently used over and over again. Whether they were repeatedly used
within just a few years or over several hundred years is still being debated, but the consensus seems
to be that they were used to cook not only deer, but also a great deal of tubers and other plants
(Black et al. 1997; Mauldin et al. 2003). These large cooking ovens which contain mounds of
accumulated fire-cracked rocks are called “burned rock middens” in the archaeological community,
but are sometimes referred to as “Indian mounds” by artifact collectors.
The common presence of deer remains in burned rock middens encourages the view that deer
processing took place at burned rock midden sites (Nickels et al. 2001; Black and McGraw
1985:278; Weir 1976:125). Bison bone is encountered in archaeological sites in central and south
14

Texas, at least occasionally, during all but the earliest part of the Middle Archaic (Dillehay 1974).
There has been a tendency to equate presence of burned rock middens with absence of bison
(Prewitt 1981); however, examinations of several recent faunal reports show that after about 4500
B.P. bison and burned rock middens are contemporaneous, though not at the same sites, at least in
the southern Edwards Plateau and northern South Texas Plain (Meissner 1993).
Late Archaic
Hofman's (1989:45) synthesis of the data places the Late Archaic on the Southern Plains as
3000–2000 B.P., and possibly later. Johnson and Holiday (1986:46) specify 4500–2000 B.P. as the
Late Archaic period on the Llano Estacado. Some researchers believe populations increased
throughout the Late Archaic (Prewitt 1985), while others feel populations remained the same or fell
during this period (Black 1989b:30). Prewitt (1981:80-81) asserts that the accumulation of burned
rock middens nearly ceased during the course of this period; however, excavations at the Blue Hole
site in Uvalde County (Mueggenborg 1994:1-74), the Honey Creek midden at 41MS32 (Black et
al. 1997), the Jonas Terrace site in Medina County (Johnson 1995), a series of middens at Camp
Bowie in Brown County (Mauldin et al. 2003), and the Mingo site in Bandera County (Houk and
Lohse 1993:193-248) provide evidence that large cooking features up to 15 m in diameter were still
very much in use (see also Black et al. 1997). Subsistence is assumed to have become less
specialized and focused on acorns, in favor of a broad spectrum subsistence base (Black 1989b:30).
Hurt (1980) asserts that bison began returning to the Southern Great Plains area, and we see an
increase in intensive processing of bison, as well as mussel shells during the Late Archaic.
However, by about 1450 B.P., bison had again disappeared (Dillehay 1974).
The proliferation of distinguishable human cemeteries has been attributed to this period, with the
earliest occurrences dating to the south Texas Middle Archaic (Hester 1995:439-440). At Loma
Sandia, these date between ca. 2550 and 2750 B.P. (Taylor and Highley 1995). Story (1985:44-45)
believes the presence of cemeteries at sites such as Ernest Witte (Hall 1981), Hitzfelder Cave
(Givens 1968), and Olmos Dam (Lukowski 1988) indicates that Late Archaic populations in central
and south Texas were increasing and becoming more territorial. Hurt (1980) further posits that
population in the Crossroads Lateral area peaked during the Late Archaic with groups moving into
the area from Central Texas; before that the complex of artifacts found in the region were more
closely associated with those of the Trans-Pecos region.
Although inhabitants of the South Texas Plain near Brownsville and Rockport had begun to make
pottery by about 1750 B.P., the northern part of the plain was still "pre-ceramic" until 1,000 years
later (Story 1985:45-47). Late Archaic points tend to be much smaller than Middle Archaic points.
The most common are Ensor and Frio types (Turner et al. 2011), both of which are short, triangular
points with side notches. The Frio point also has a notched base (Turner et al. 2011).
Transitional Archaic
During the Early Neo-Indian period on the Southern Great Plains (ca. 950–1450 B.P.), Hurt (1980)
presents evidence for perhaps a decrease in bison processing; consistent with Dillehay's (1974)
contention that there are now less bison available in the area due to climatic changes, which also
lowered water tables to alkalinity levels.

15

Late Prehistoric/Plains Woodland
The term “Plains Woodland or Woodland” is commonly used on the Southern Great Plains. A
series of distinctive traits marks the shift from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric period, including
the technological shift to the bow and arrow and the introduction of pottery. Two complexes
following the Late Archaic in the Southern Great Plains region are the Plains Woodland from about
2000-1150 B.P., and the Plains Village from 1150-450 B.P. (Hofman 1989:61-90). Most
researchers agree the early Late Prehistoric period was a time of population decrease (Black
1989b:32). Though small burned rock middens associated with Scallorn and Edwards points have
been found (Goode 1991:71; Houk and Lohse 1993:193-248), they are rare. Settlement shifts into
rockshelters such as Scorpion Cave in Medina County (Highley et al. 1978) and Classen
Rockshelter in northern Bexar County (Fox and Fox 1967) have been noted (Shafer 1977; Skinner
1981). Cemeteries from this period often reveal evidence of conflict (Black 1989b:32).
Huebner (1991:354-355) suggests that the sudden return of bison to south and central Texas
resulted from a more xeric climate in the plains north of Texas, and increased grass in the
Cross-Timbers and Post Oak Savannah in north central Texas, forming a “bison corridor” into the
South Texas Plain along the eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau. However, according to Hurt
(1980), the Late Neo-Indian period on the Southern Great Plains (ca. 950 – 450 B.P.) is mirrored
in the archaeological record by an absence of bison and vegetal matter, most likely due to the
increased alkalinity in the region's water sources.
Protohistoric/Historic Period
The end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic period on the Southern Plains in
northern Texas should be characterized by written accounts of European contact with indigenous
groups, and is often labeled the “Protohistoric”. On the Southern High Plains, Hofman (1989:91)
agrees that “The Protohistoric period is encompassed by the time when there were limited European
contacts with the area and brief records of these journeys, but no proper history.” The cultural
context for the historic groups in the area of study is largely conditioned by the presence of outside
ethnic groups and regional power struggles. The numerous small groups of Jumanos and
Coahuiltecans encountered by the early explorers and later Spanish intrusions are addressed in
many sources (Campbell 1983; Campbell and Campbell 1985; Hester 1989; John 1975; Newcomb
1961; Swanton 1952). The various later intrusive groups, such as Tonkawa, Lipan Apache, and
Comanche, are also described by numerous researchers (Ewers 1969; Hester 1989; Jones 1969;
Kelley 1971; Newcomb 1961, 1993; Sjoberg 1953a, 1953b).
At the beginning of the seventeenth century, many south Texas Indian groups were being pushed
northward by continual Spanish expansion. By the mid-seventeenth century, a new pressure on the
Indians indigenous to the area began to come from the north: a nomadic group, the Apache adapted
to a more Plains-lifeway style of bison hunting once they acquired horses from the Spaniards
(Campbell and Campbell 1985:27). Later, the Apaches were to be displaced by another group of
nomadic, bison-hunting Indians - the Comanches - from the high-lands of central Texas (Campbell
1991:111).
A combination of migration, demoralization, inner-group conflict, disease, and death due to warfare
fragmented the native Indian groups, and forced continual mixing and re-mixing among them
16

(Bolton 1915; Campbell 1975, 1991:345; León et al. 1961). Most of the native languages have been
lost, although recent attempts at reconstruction are enlightening (e.g. Johnson 1994; Johnson and
Campbell 1992).

Site Types to be Expected Along the Crossroads Lateral
Prehistoric Open Campsites
Most numerous among the sites recorded in Martin County are prehistoric open campsites ranging
in age from the Paleoindian period through the Historic period. Some of these represent a single
campfire where a very small group of Native Americans may have camped for one night. Others
are very large, covering very extensive areas representing large groups of people that stayed for
long periods, perhaps seasonally, with ancestral groups returning to these same campsites over a
period of several thousands of years. Cultural remains to be found at these large campsites include
among other items, an abundance of fire-cracked rocks representing multiple hearths, a wide
variety of chipped stone tools and the lithic debris that results from making them, ground and
smoothed stones used to grind nuts and seeds, faunal remains from terrestrial and aquatic animals
consumed, bone tools, pottery sherds, and mussel and snail shells. Open campsites occur in all
types of environments, whether that be in a plush riverine environment that offered a wide variety
banquet of plant and animal foodstuffs, or in the uplands away from flowing water sources.
Seasonally, the upland grasses, shrubs, cacti offered a different food source that could be exploited
such as various grass seeds, mesquite beans, prickly pear pads and tunas, and agave hearts. In
addition, at various times, bison were known to graze on the northern South Texas Plains, and were
highly sought after for use as food, hides, and bone tools (Dillehay 1974).
Depending upon the integrity of these open campsites, archaeologists and the Texas Historical
Commission consider these as perhaps the most significant types of sites in regard to their ability
to contribute to our understanding of south Texas prehistory. A few of the desired ingredients that
can indicate significance include cultural material that is buried beneath the surface in a wellpreserved, stratified, and relatively undisturbed context. Although these situations most frequently
occur within stratified terrace deposits adjacent to streams, they can also occur in upland settings
where the landscape has been generally stable through time. Other ingredients that archaeologists
look for in potentially significant campsites include good organic preservation in the form of
charcoal and/or charred plant remains, faunal preservation, temporally diagnostic stone tools or
ceramics, and intact features such as hearths.
Prehistoric Lithic Scatters or Procurement Sites
Lithic scatters are the next most common type of archaeological site that can be expected along the
Crossroads Lateral. These sites simply represent the chipped stone debris and broken tools that
were left behind when Native Americans made new tools or re-sharpened their old ones. The
general absence of fire-cracked rocks and other cultural material normally found at open campsites
suggest that they did not camp there, or remain there for any extended period of time (However,
small camp fires may have been used to heat-treat chert or quartzite cobbles to make them more
17

knappable). Yet, they were drawn to these isolated locales because of the natural outcroppings or
surface exposures of good quality raw material such as chert or quartzite cobbles. Examples of
chipped stone most commonly found at these sites include cobbles with one or two flakes removed,
called ‘tested cobbles’. That is, the Native Americans knew from experience the quality of stone
that could most easily be flaked and reduced for stone tool production, so they ‘tested’ the cobble
to judge whether it was useable or not. If the quality was judged to be inferior, then the cobble was
tossed aside. That is why the majority of tested cobbles found on these sites are of poor quality,
coarse-grained material. While the finished stone tool products are carried away from these sites,
what remains are those tools broken during the manufacturing process, and the thousands of pieces
of debitage in the form of flakes and angular debris. Also unique to lithic scatters where large
cobbles are present are snapped ‘quarry blanks’. These are simply cobbles flakes on both sides,
reducing the cobble into a transportable ‘blank’ that can be used to further reduce it and make
finished stone tools from the flakes taken off of it. The unbroken quarry blanks are usually not
found on these sites because they have been carried off, presumably to areas of south Texas where
raw material is not readily available. The snapped or broken quarry blanks are of little or no use,
so they are discarded and left behind.
Lithic scatters range in age from the Paleoindian through the Historic periods and can be found on
any landscape setting where gravels or cobbles have been exposed. Notably, gravel outcrops that
were exposed to the surface a few hundred or thousand years ago could be deeply buried today,
and the opposite could also be true; it all depends on the terrain setting and lithic scatters in the
three-county area have been documented along upper stream terraces abutting the eroded upland
slopes.
Prehistoric Quarries
Prehistoric quarries can also range in age from the Paleoindian through Historic periods, but differ
from lithic scatters in that at those sites Native Americans exploited loose gravels, but at times they
specifically sought quarry sites where raw material such as cherts or quartzites were not yet freed
from their parent geologic formation, and they had to be ‘quarried’. These types of sites are rare
in Texas for two reasons: 1) the geological exposures generally do not present themselves, and 2)
throughout Texas, even in central Texas, it is much easier to pick up gravels from the surface than
to try to mine them from hard rock. Quarried and chipped stone remains likely to be found at these
sites include large chunks of angular cherts or quartzites, as well as parent material detritus, and
flaking debris. Snapped quarry blanks can also be expected. Although a handful of prehistoric
quarry sites have been recorded in this area of Texas, they are rare.
Prehistoric Burned Rock Middens
Burned rock middens result from a series of multiple-use earth ovens that were constructed much
like modern-day roasting pits are dug into the earth for roasting a pig. With repetitive uses, as the
larger rocks that serve as heating elements in the earthen pit fracture and thus become less effective
as a thermal source, they are ‘pitched out’ around the edge of the pit. As the pit becomes unusable,
another is dug near by, and the procedure repeated. Over time, these multiple pits and the ‘pitched
out’ fire-cracked rocks coalesce together, obscuring each pit as indiscernible. (For a full discussion
of the formation of burned rock middens and their documented presence in Texas, see Leach and
Bousman 2001; Leach et al. 2001; Mauldin et al. 2003).
18

Prehistoric Burial and Cemetery Sites
Although not common, isolated prehistoric burials and cemeteries have been documented in this
area of Texas. Individual and isolated burials have been found in association with open campsites
in both upland settings as well as in alluvial terraces along streams.
Historic Sites
Although Spanish ranchers had established large ranches in northern Mexico by the mid-16th
century, and Spanish entradas began penetrating south Texas in the 1700s and 1800s, there is no
record of any sort of permanent structures in the area during those periods (Chipman 1992), the
North area was generally not considered safe for settlement by whites until after the Civil War in
1865, and white settlers then began establishing smaller ranches and farmlands.
Because of the vastness of the landscape and the relatively late settlement and development of this
area of Texas compared to east and central Texas and northern Mexico, historic sites are not
abundant, but they certainly do exist. The most common types to be encountered are related to
ranching and farming endeavors, or small communities from the 19th and 20th centuries. Site types
most commonly include farmsteads or ranches with corrals, cisterns, chimney and foundation
remains from both main houses and outbuildings, related trash dumps, an occasional family burial
or cemetery, school houses, churches, community buildings, and industry-related structures or
construction projects.

Martin County History
Although evidence of Native American presence for several thousand years within what was to
become the modern political boundary of Martin County has been well documented
archaeologically, written documents are only extant beginning with the 1700s. It is clear that the
Comanches displaced the Apaches, and then dominated this area of west Texas by about 1750.
Then, in the 1870s, the United States Army forced the Comanches from the region, opening the
area for white settlers. By 1876, lands were set aside from the vast Bexar County for the
establishment of Martin County. During an interim period from 1876 through 1884, the
administration of Martin County was attached first to Mitchell County, and then to Howard County.
Finally, in 1884, there were enough citizens in present-day Martin County so that its own
government was established, and Stanton (previously named Mariensfield) became the county seat.
At that time, springs in this area of west Texas were still flowing; one of those well known to
Indians and the U.S. Army was at what today is known as Mustang Pond, the first water source that
emigrants encountered some two miles west of modern-day Big Spring.
In 1881, the Texas and Pacific Rail Line was built through the Big Spring area, and spurred an
expansion of population in Martin County. New settlers moved into the area and began cattle
ranching and sheep ranching endeavors, and farmed grain, cotton, vegetables, and orchards. To
supplement their subsistence, they hunted wild game such as antelope, deer, quail, a the few buffalo
that remained on the open prairie/grassland.
19

By 1890, the number of settlers in Martin County had increased from only 12 ten years before, to
262. By 1900, the population had increased to 332. By 1920, cotton became the major cash crop.
Much like the rest of the nation, the Great Depression of the 1930s affected this rural area of west
Texas. Nevertheless, Martin County’s economy rebounded during WWII. By the 1940s, there were
over 22,000 acres being farmed in Martin County.
Oil and gas production came relatively late to Martin County compared to the rest of the
surrounding Permian Basin region. Although a few wells were drilled in Martin County the 1920s,
the only significantly producing well did not come in until 1945. Then, in 1950, several deep oil
fields were discovered, and an oil boom was underway (Stoner and Dixon 1974; Hunt and Leffler
1996). Thanks to modern technology such as horizontal drilling and fracturing in the early part of
the 21st century, the citizens and ranchers of Martin County are once again experiencing a robust
economy.

Archaeological Atlas Site Results
We preface this section by stating that although it presents the number of sites and their types
documented within Martin County, the results simply provide the data that is available. In reality,
the number of documented sites and their types are very heavily skewed based upon the types of
cultural resource surveys, and the limited areas of those surveys. To wit, a review of the Texas
Atlas indicated that there were only three known archaeological sites within one mile of the Project
Area. That said, the data that is available on the Texas Atlas is only as good as the surveys
represent. The vast majority of Martin County has never been subjected to formal cultural resource
surveys, so it is conceded that the true character of the archaeological record is very poorly
understood. Nevertheless, the few surveys that have been accomplished provide at least some
aspect of what the area looks like from an archaeological perspective.
Martin County
A total of 69 archaeological sites had been recorded in Martin County as of April 20, 2015. Fortyseven of those are prehistoric open campsites, and five are prehistoric lithic scatters. Notably, some
of the more significant campsites and lithic scatters are adjacent to playa lakes. At one Early
Archaic campsite an ancient well believed to date to that time period was documented. In addition,
pottery sherds such as Chupadero Black-on-White, Brushed brownware, El Paso polychrome, and
Ochoa indented have been found, indicating either long distance trade or adopted ceramic
technology and styles. The 23 historic components documented in Martin County consist of
numerous late 1800s and early 1900s trash dumps and scatters. However there are also late 1800s
and early 1900s farmsteads and house sites, WWI bombing range practice targets, and the site of
Carmelite Monastery/Sisters of Mercy Convent in Stanton (Atlas 2015).
Previously Documented Archaeological Sites and Surveys
The western-most segment of the Navigator Midstream Crossroads Lateral is shown in Figure 3.
The western portion of this segment traverses a slope where outcropping of gravels are likely
20

extant, and where Native Americans likely procured lithic materials for making stone tools.
Otherwise, the terrain through this segment is relatively unremarkable, and suggests a minimal
potential for buried, intact, and thus significant archaeological deposits.
As shown in Figure 4, in the middle segment of the Navigator Midstream Crossroads Lateral there
are no documented archaeological surveys or sites within one mile. Although the terrain through
this segment is relatively unremarkable, and suggests a minimal potential for buried, intact, and
thus significant archaeological deposits, historic resources may be extant.
As shown in Figure 5, there are also no documented archaeological surveys or sites within one mile
of this segment of the proposed Crossroads Lateral. However, the eastern edge approaches Suplhur
Springs Draw, that although flowing only intermittently in modern times, was likely spring-fed at
various times in prehistory. As such, this locale on the edge of the draw would have been a magnet
for Native Americans to hunt and camp.

Background Review Summary
From this preliminary cultural resources background review, it was clear that the proposed
Navigator Energy Systems Crossroads Lateral right-of-way in all probability, would encounter
previously undocumented archaeological sites. This is best manifested by the scant few
professional surveys that have been conducted in Martin County. Some of the sites that are likely
to be encountered along the Crossroads Lateral right-of-way may be heavily disturbed and/or
redundant site types, and as such have little to contribute to the prehistory of south Texas. These
sites should be considered as non-significant, and should not impede the pipeline’s construction as
planned. However, it is also clear from this review that there is a moderate to high probability that
archaeological sites of significance could lie in the planned right-of-way. Without an on-the-ground
physical survey, this assessment can only be surmised.
Although the number of sites in this area of Texas, and their potential significance can be modeled,
because of the scant few professional surveys that have been conducted in these areas to date, under
less stringent standards, such models are considered unreliable. Accordingly, without an on-theground archaeological survey, the ubiquity of archaeological sites and their scientific research
potential along the Navigator Crossroads Lateral would remain an unknown.
In sum, it appeared that the pipeline is to be routed through areas that may be sensitive to
archaeological deposits. To be sure of our desktop assessment, Tierras Antiguas recommended that
a full pedestrian survey, with shovel testing in moderate and high probability areas, be conducted
along the Navigator Crossroads Lateral right-of-way.

Project Goals and Methods
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with limited shovel testing. The topics addressed were
site type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The prehistoric theoretical framework
is structured around patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and social systems for the regions.
The historic framework is structured around the 1800s and 1900s settlement in the area as
documented in the earliest written accounts by Spanish priests, government representatives, and
early Anglo-American settlers, through the Mexican and Republic of Texas sovereignty periods,
and into the Texas Statehood period.
The goals of the project were to:
1)

locate and record cultural locations and sites in the project area using a systematic
survey methodology;

2)

quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy; and,

3)

place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.

surface visibility
was greater than 90 percent (see for example, Figures 12 and 13). Otherwise, the remaining,
roughly 0.9 miles of pipeline is to be constructed through typical mesquite brush, salt cedar, and
cactus near Sulphur Springs Draw, where surface visibility ranged from 30 percent to greater than
70 percent.
In accordance with a general “no collection” policy, cultural material of a redundant nature, both
prehistoric and historic, were not to be collected. Instead, they were to be fully documented via
sketches, field photographs, and copious notes. Exceptions were to be made for diagnostic artifacts,
particularly those artifacts which could be considered as significant to the interpretation of Texas
prehistory, such as Early Archaic-Paleoindian transitional, or Paleoindian diagnostics. These were
to be collected on a case-by-case basis, and that decision was left up to the Principal Investigator
and/or the Project Archaeologist. Historic buildings, trash scatters, or other historic occurrences
adjacent to the ROW were to be documented with photographs and included in this report of
investigations.

Survey Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
Four Tierras Antiguas archaeologists conducted the field survey on April 13, 2015. Surface
visibility along the right-of-way varied from 70 to 100-percent. Typically, fine sandy loam and clay

23

loam soils with fragmented caliche were encountered throughout the 9.3 miles. Notably, generally
absent were gravels suitable for fashioning stone tools.
During the course of the survey, no evidence of either prehistoric or historic cultural materials was
observed. In addition, no potentially historic structures were observed along the periphery of the
right-of-way.
Accordingly, Tierras Antiguas recommends that the project should be considered as having “no
effect” on any properties considered as eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic
Places or inclusion in the State Archeological Landmarks Program, and as such, the project should
be allowed to proceed without further archaeological work. However, if any cultural resources are
encountered during construction, work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds
are examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and
by the Texas Historical Commission.
No artifacts were collected and curated during this project.
