ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of a proposed 48 inch water line, approximately three
miles in length, in north Brazos County, Texas was conducted in January 2003 by
Brazos Valley Research Associates of Bryan, Texas with William E. Moore serving as
the Principal Investigator. Antiquities permit 3066 was issued for this project. The
project area was investigated by shovel testing and probing, and no archaeological sites
were found. It is recommended that the City of Bryan be allowed to proceed with
construction as planned. Copies of the report are on file at the Texas Historical
Commission, Archeology Division; the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL); and the City of Bryan.

The contract for this project was awarded to Brazos Valley Research Associates
by the City of Bryan. Glenn Jones, Plant Operations Manager, is acknowledged for
providing logistical support in the form of maps, obtaining landowner permission, and
assisting the field crew locate the proper access points to this overland route. The
Principal Investigator was assisted in the field by James E. Warren (Project
Archaeologist), Art Romine, and Bobby Jemison. The figures that appear in this report
were prepared by Lili Lyddon of LL Technical Services in North Zulch, Texas.

INTRODUCTION
Brazos Valley Research Associates was retained by the City of Bryan to conduct
a 100% Phase I cultural resources survey for the proposed 48 inch water line in north
Brazos County, Texas (Figure 1). The project area is depicted on United States
Geological Survey topographic map Bryan West (Figure 2). The proposed water line is
approximately three miles in length with an easement of 30 feet. A 48 inch pipe will be
placed in a 60 inch wide trench with an average cover of three feet. The proposed
water line begins at Louis Mikulin Road and traverses cross-country parallel to the
Southern Pacific Railroad grade to the City of Bryan low service pump station. The
three mile project area is approximately 21.8 acres in size. There are two major stream
crossings, Thompson Creek and Thompsons Branch (Figure 2). Since the route of the
water line is viewed as a setting likely to contain prehistoric sites, an archaeological
survey was required. This project will be reviewed at the state level by the Archeology
Division of the Texas Historical Commission. Antiquities permit 3066 was issued for this
project. The field survey was conducted on January 15-17, 2003. The survey crew
consisted of the James E. Warren, Art Romine, and Bobby Jemison.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
According to a recently published planning document for the Eastern Planning
Region of Texas (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 1.1.2), Brazos County is situated
within the Southeast Texas archeological study region. In 1985, according to a
statistical overview prepared by the Texas Historical Commission (Biesaart et al.
1985:114), Brazos County contained 33 recorded sites. In 1985, 0 sites in the county
had been excavated, 0 had been tested by hand, and 33 had been surface collected.
Two recorded prehistoric sites in the county were listed as Paleoindian, 1 was listed as
General Archaic, and 1 was listed as Late Prehistoric (Biesaart et al. 1985:114). The
archaeological potential of Brazos County is reflected in part by the increasing number
of recorded sites found as a result of cultural resource management studies. The
number of recorded sites now stands at 151 (Jean Hughes, personal communication,
December 4, 2002).
A check of the records at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in
Austin, Texas revealed no archeological sites have been recorded within the current
project area. It was discovered that sites have been recorded in the region, and several
significant archaeological investigations have been performed in Brazos County.
Prehistoric sites in this area are typically found on sandy ridges and uplands in close
proximity to dependable sources of water such as creeks and rivers. No prehistoric
sites in the county have been reported on clay hills or in active floodplains.
It is beyond the scope of this report to discuss in detail the archaeological
background of Brazos County, especially when numerous contract reports are available.
The interested reader is referred to the statistical overview (Biesaart et al. 1985) and the
planning document published by the Texas Historical Commission (Kenmotsu and
Perttula 1993) for more detailed information regarding the prehistory of Brazos County.

FIELD METHODS
Prior to entering the field, the Principal Investigator checked with the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory for the presence of previously recorded sites in the
project area and vicinity. No sites were found to be within the route of the proposed
water line.
On January 15, 2003, the survey crew visited the project area with Glenn Jones,
Plant Operations Manger for the City of Bryan. Since the route travels overland and
crosses one major creek, one of its tributaries, and several gullies, the crew was unable
to walk the entire route without entering the project area at different access points. Mr.
Jones drove the crew to these access points so they could get to the various sections
blocked by these streams.
The entire line was walked by the survey crew who looked for artifacts and
features on the surface. Because of poor ground surface visibility the area was
subjected to shovel testing. Tests were placed on terraces and hills considered to have
the potential for containing buried cultural materials. Shovel tests were dug to clay
when possible, and the size of each test was 30 x 50 cm in diameter and varied in depth
from 10 to 90 centimeters below the existing ground surface. Some tests were
terminated due to saturated soils. All excavated fill was screened through 1/4 inch
hardware cloth. Data obtained from shovel testing were recorded on a shovel test log
(Appendix I). In all, 41 shovel tests were dug.

RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Examination of the files at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in
Austin, Texas revealed no sites have been recorded in the project area. There was also
no indication that any part of the project area had been surveyed by professional
archaeologists. No archaeological sites were found in the project area. It is the opinion
of Brazos Valley Research Associates that there are no archaeological sites within the
route of the water line. Therefore, it is recommended that construction be allowed to
proceed as planned. It is always possible that archaeological sites are missed during
any cultural resources survey. Should areas containing prehistoric or historic artifacts
not discussed in this report be discovered during construction, Archeology Division,
Texas Historical Commission, must be notified immediately and all work stopped in the
area of concern until the situation can be evaluated.
