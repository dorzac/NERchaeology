Archaic Stage •itea :found at Stillhou.ee Hollow rJhould be par:~··

ticularly fruitful.

Recent research at Canyon Reservoir 1

near New Braunfel•, 'l'exa.a, h&• begun to reveal a meaningful
culture strati9ra.phy within th• Archaic.

In view of these

findings, comparative data are badly needed froa other areas

of central Tex.a.a.

A study of the Stillhouse Hollow Arch•ic

site• could provide much of the COlllparative information which

ie needed for the establia'hRlent of a valid Archaic culture
sequence in the region.

'lhe Neo-American sit••• it ifl hoped,

can likewise provide comparative data to help fill out the

artifact sequence for the pottery--bow and arrow period.

Judging from the two dart points. the cultural

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Eleven archeological sites were visited and recorded
during a survey of the Stillhouse Hollow Reservoir area in
Bell County, Texas.

The principal archeological complexes
Edwa~ds

represented by these sites are the
of the /\rchliic Stage and

Plateau Aspect

the Centrnl Tcxna 1\apcct of the

Neo-American Stage.
It is recommended that three of these sites be tested
extensively, and that limited testing be carried out at
six others; this schedule should provide a representative
sample of the archeological data endangered by the reservoir construction project.
vation units

It is estimated that two exca-

($40,000.00) will be required for the recommend-

ed excavations.

An excavation unit is defined as follows:

Excavation Unit
1 archeologist, for 1 year
1 assistant archeologist, for 3 months
1 laboratory assistant, for 9 months
1 clerk-typist, for 3 months
8 laborers, for 3 months
Field and travel expenses
Transportation
Equipment
Supplies and materials
Administrative overhead
Miscellaneous and reserve for contingencies
TOTAL

$ 5,500.00
900000
2,250.00
750.00
4,800.00
1,200.00
600.00
300.00
300.00
2,608000
