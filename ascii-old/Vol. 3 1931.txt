SOME TYPES OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL
SITES IN TRANS-PECOS TEXAS
BY HENRY T. FLETCHER
Archeological sites are found at more or less
close intervals throughout the Trans-Pecos region
of Texas. These sites are of various types depending
upon the uses made of them by their aboriginal
builders who utilized the limited facilities at hand
in their efforts to live. Their chief needs were water,
protection, game and plants that provided food. The
type and distribution of sites reflect conditions as
they obtained at the time of their occupation.

Some miles to the northwest, a thick bed of red
conglomerate, in weathering, yields nodules of flint,
chert and novaculite. A nearby lava flow carries
numerous geodes of agate and chalcedony. At a
number of points in this area workshops are found,
the ground being covered with numerous flakes and
chips, together with nodules from which they were
chipped. Celts, fragments of knives and points, and
rude hammer stones are still not uncommon, though
these sites have been visited repeatedly.

hearths.
Flint Sources

Mounds

The Edwardâs Limestone includes several strata
characteristically rich in flint nodules reaching the
size of a base ball. The nodules range in color from
black, through blue and gray, to pink. An outcropping
of Edwardâs Limestone, in the form of a high bluff,
along the south side of Buck and Chalk Draws,
about sixty miles southeast of Alpine, contains
several dry shelter camps of various sizes. At
several points, independent of camp sites, scattered
chips and fragments of flint, many with flaked edges,
indicate the site of work shops. It is quite probable
that the flints were quarried from the nearby bluff.

Mounds of several types are found. Most of them
are composed of rather well sorted rocks, usually
two or three inches in diameter. Charcoal and soil,
having the appearance of having been burned, are
generally present.
One type of mounds is found along trails
ascending talus slopes from valleys to hills.
Sometimes, only one mound is present but several
usually occur at intervals from the bottom to near
the top of the trail. On one trail ascending the
Mitchell Mesa, ten miles northwest of the 02 Ranch,
there are seven such mounds. They are roughly

circular in outline, some ten feet in diameter, and
three or four feet high. The topsoil under the mound,
lowest on the trail, yielded charcoal. No artifacts
were found at or near any of them. Their uses are
problematical. They may have been trail markers;
pointers to water; caches; or burials, though the
latter is hardly likely as the soil under the mound
examined apparently had not been disturbed.

was made as a ceremonial. The larger part of this
collection is in the Museum of the West Texas
Historical & Scientific Society.

Between Leoncito Spring and Hovey, about
twenty-five miles northeast of Alpine, is a snake or
serpentine mound of earth. It is three yards wide,
two to three feet high, and about one thousand yards
long. It winds through the brush, having some plants
growing on it. A corral is situated near the head
and any peculiar shape it might have had has been
obliterated by the activities of working cattle over
a long period of time. The tail describes a circle

usually shallow and are indicated by low mounds
of rather large stones placed with some care. The
mounds are round or oval, the bodies often being
buried in a flexed position.

Burials

Burial sites are of several types: in dry shelters
and caves; on talus slopes and on open high points.
The cave and shelter burials are rather common in

we find it growing in locales of volcanic rocks as
well as those of limestone. This gives us types of
sotol pits, the main difference being in the kind of
rock of which they are built. In this region they are
circular and average ten or twelve feet in diameter.
As found today, they are as a rule lower in the center
and composed of rocks of rather uniform size. They
are generally located some distance from camp
sites, often one half mile or more, and near the foot
of the hills where the sotol grows. Two miles east
of Diff Spring a single sotol pit is on the top of a
long point, there being a light stand of sotol at
present growing on the slopes nearby. This mound
is hidden by a thicket of sumac, that grows in the
ashy soil of the pit. The few artifacts found near
sotol mounds include metates and manos.
E. W. Wilson, in the work above cited, has
described the method of cooking sotol. He quotes
F. M. Buckelew, an early traveler, as saying that
meal was made from the cooked sotol. This would
account for the presence of grinding implements.
Another method of eating is indicated by the
numerous chewed quids of sotol leaves found in
the dry shelters of this region.
Rock Walls
Rock walls were used for shelter in this region.
At a number of points in the Davis Mountains walls
of rough masonry are found. At one place in Green
Valley a room about seven feet in diameter is found
having walls two feet high except for a rude opening
on one side.
In some places rocks are used to chink or stop
openings between large boulders to afford
protection against north winds. Remnants of walls
are found in many shelters and semi-shelters,
indicating the outlines of small rooms, usually
circular in shape. In the exploration of the Bee Cave
Canyon Shelter, by Mr. Coffin, small circular rooms,
with walls of crude masonry laid without mortar,
were found practically the whole length of 768 feet.

remains of a system of irrigation ditches are found.
They are in the form of connected low ridges, two
or three yards wide, covering several hundred acres
of land that slopes southward to Alamo Cesario
Creek. The site is too high above the creek to have
received its water supply from that source unless it
was diverted some distance above and brought
down in a ditch skirting the hills on the north side
of the draw. It is more probable that the water came
from a spring, in the canyon north of the field, now
dry or plugged, as some have suggested. There is
no suggestion of ditch on the tops of the ridges today,
but the two series of parallel ridges, at right angles
to each other, preclude the idea that they might
indicate natural drainage channels.
When Fort Davis was established in 1854, C.
G. Raht, in The Romance of the Davis Mountains,
says the soldiers reported seeing the Indians
irrigating crops by ditches which took water from
Limpio Creek nearby. I do not know whether any
sign of these ditches are to be seen today.
Mortar Holes
While mortar holes are found at most camp sites,
especially those occurring in shelters or on hilly
terrain, sites are often found where they are the only
sign of previous occupation now to be seen. At a
number of sites mortar holes are found singly or in
groups: sometimes on rocks at the foot of talus
slopes, and sometimes on ledges near gullies or
creeks. The kitchen midden mounds that were once
probably located nearby have disappeared. Usually
no artifacts are found though occasionally a mano
or flint fragments are noted.
Trails

Early maps of the region show several Indian
trails that were said to have been well marked when
first noted by the early travellers west of the Pecos.
Parts of these trails are still preserved where they
ascend bluffs or traverse rocky terrain. One of these
sites is in Middle Canyon passing out of Green
Valley to the westward. Near the head of the canyon

San Esteben, twelve miles south of Marfa,
the trace of a well traveled trail is seen.
Here, the travel of countless years has cut
deep into the lava in some ten parallel
paths, some of them more than a foot deep.
This trail was said to have been used by
the Commanches in their forays into
Mexico.
Battlefield
Five miles east of the 02 Ranch, running
east and west, a hill rises some two
hundred feet above the Alpine road. The
highest point of this hill is called
Cottonwood Mesa from Cottonwood
Spring in a canyon behind it to the
northward. Cottonwood Canyon emerges
east of the mesa and contains within its
mouth a large camp site. In smaller
canyons to the west are sites of smaller
camps.
On an area of several hundred acres,
lying about a mile southwest of
Cottonwood Mesa, many arrow points
have been picked up, usually one at a time.
No other class of artifact or signs of a camp
site have been noted. From the fact that so
many weapon points have been found in
so small an area, it is believed that a battle
was fought here between enemy groups.
The inhabitants of the Cottonwood Canyon
camps were, probably the defenders.

in the Green Valley section.

Sand Flat Camps
Sand flat camp sites are not uncommon in the
salt basin region east of El Paso. They were
commonly on the shores of the shallow lakes that
were often dry. The gradual drying up of the lakes
has left many sites some distance from the present
shore lines. The shifting of the sands by wind action
has partially or wholly covered other sites.

Hill Camp Sites
Hill camp sites are of three sub-types: those
utilizing a south facing bluff for protection; those
having tepee sites marked by circles of boulders;
and those built on talus slopes. In each the kitchen
mounds are on the south slope of the hill or at the
foot of the bluff.

Valley Camp Sites
Valley camp sites are usually found
just above the danger of high water and
near a rocky point. Sometimes, however,
they occur in the middle of wide draws
where they must have been subject to
overflows. Possibly, they were occupied
only in seasons of the year when rains
would not be expected. These sites are
marked with large mounds of burned
rock, mixed with soil that has been
blackened with ashes. Artifacts usually
occurring include: metates, manos,
knives, weapon points, hammer stones,
scrapers and numerous chips and
rejects. In the Green Valley region an
anvil rock of red lava is usually found,
especially where ledges of rock are not
near. Small hearths occur at many camp
sites.
Mounds
The 02 Ranch is situated on a branch
of Terlingua Creek, which for several
miles is a small running stream of fine
water. At close intervals are mounds of
burned rock, some oblong in outline and
as much as one hundred feet long. These
mounds have been flattened out as the
draw was subject to overflows until the
creek was washed out to near its present
dimensions. The mounds commonly bear
a more vigorous growth of lote bush,
mesquite or creosote bush than the
surrounding soil. Two arrow shaft
polishers were found near one of these
mounds.

On a bench at the east side of the mouth of
Cottonwood Canyon is a site with six tepees
outlined by red gritty boulders from the ledge
forming the hill. There are many mortar holes along
the edge of the low bluff making the bench and a
great mound of burned rock under the bluff on the
south. At one point the bluff forms a semi-shelter
several feet deep. Boulders form the outlines of
several rooms, probably having been used to weigh
down tepee walls. Many artifacts common to camp
sites were found.
On the opposite bench is a similar site except
that only two or three tepee sites are present. Here,
several thin metates were found. The rock from
which they were fashioned occurs in thin beds under
the gritty conglomerate which forms the bench. Two
types of metates are often found at camp sites. One,
a thin plaque type of light material, the other often
a foot thick and of lava or sandstone. The latter
was probably used in situ while the thinner type
may have been carried from place to place. In Green
Valley the metates were hollowed on only one face.
At a camp site three miles south of Alpine, in an
oak grove near a small spring, metates were found
that were hollowed on both faces.
The mouth of Cottonwood Canyon between the
camp sites is dry today, the nearest natural water
being at Cottonwood Spring a mile above. Early
maps showed a large water hole at this point which
was called Ojo de San Aparicio.
Mortar Holes
Three miles north of the 02 Ranch, at the point
of a low flat topped hill near the mouth of Diff
Canyon, is a mortar hole camp site with hundreds
of mortar holes made in the great slabs of volcanic
tuffs that have rolled down from the low bluff at
the top of the mesa. A small shelter in this bluff has
several pictographs, one a perfect, life size, left
hand done in cinnabar red. Several mounds of
burned rock occur at the foot of the slope and a
workshop at the north edge of the camp. Many of
the typical camp site artifacts have been picked up
here.

Metal Artifacts
The writer found a steel knife blade, four inches
long, badly oxidized and with the point broken. It
had lugs on each side for fastening to the handle.
With a reading glass it was possible to decipher
the words PIERRE RAVOLIER. This blade appears
to have been hand forged, the name, no doubt, being
that of the maker. It probably reached the Big Bend
through the connection of Commanche Indians with
French traders on the Arkansas or Missouri rivers.
A camp site two miles to the west yielded a flat
wrought iron spike, seven inches long, that had been
worked to make a rude chisel. At another site nearby
a slender steel knife blade was found. It was about
eight inches long and was branded with a small
anchor.
Dry Shelter
The dry shelter sites vary in size from those
providing shelter for not more than two persons to
the Bee Cave Canyon shelter, measured by Mr.
Coffin, which is 768 feet long and 108 feet in
maximum depth. Vol. 6, No. 4, Indian Notes
describes the exploration of that shelter. The dry
shelters of this region have also been described by
V. J. Smith, in Vol. 29, No. 2, The American
Anthropologist.
Many shelters occur near Alpine, some of them
yielding burials besides the wooden and fiber
articles and stone artifacts usually found. Many of
them contain pictographs and a few sherds have
been picked up.
In the limestone areas of Trans-Pecos many caves
occur. Most of them show some signs of occupancy,
though only the area near the mouths were occupied.
The cave sites often contain burials. Some forty
feet back in a cave, six miles southwest of Santiago
Peak, two burials were found. The bodies were in
baskets laid on poles over a natural vertical shaft
that descended from the floor of the cave. The
bottom of the shaft yielded nothing of interest.

Texas Archaeological and Paleontological Society
Pueblos
Very near the Texas-New Mexico line, some
thirty miles northeast of El Paso, are the ruins of
several large pueblos. The foundation walls of
masonry, laid in a brittle gray mortar, are partly or
wholly covered by drifting sand.
Water and shelter seem to have been determining
factors in the location and type of sites. The larger
camp sites are found near permanent water and their
occurrence would indicate that a constant supply
of water has existed over a long period. Other large
camp sites, where no water is now found, indicate
that springs have become dry or streams have
changed their courses since they were inhabited.

paint, four inches in diameter, was found in a shelter
in Sunny Glen, west of Alpine, by Ross Smith, son
of V. J. Smith. It is now in the Museum of the West
Texas Historical & Scientific Society.
Plants

Certain plants make more vigorous growths in
the ashy soil of the burned rock mounds of this
region. Camp sites, sotol pits, hearths and other
sites may often be located by watching for groups
of plants larger in size and richer in color than the
plants around them. Shelters and talus slope sites
may often be located in the same manner, as shrubs,
usually found growing in draws or flat terrain, are
often found to have adapted themselves to the

SOME FLINT SOURCES IN CENTRAL WEST TEXAS
BY E. B. SAYLES
Edwards Limestone
The source of flint of the
aboriginal inhabitants of Central
West Texas was principally from
the limestones of the Edwards
Plateau. The flint occurs about
the middle of the Lower
Cretaceous series and varies in
color from a lead or blue slate
to nearly black, while some is
grey, specked or mottled with
lighter or darker colors.
Other strata of this formation
carry much cherty material, a
great deal of which has eroded
out and has been deposited with
the flint nodules upon the high
gravel hills along streams in this
section. This re-deposited
material
was
worked
extensively, but apparently was
not wholly satisfactory as there
are thousands of rejects.

Where the flint has recently
eroded out of its limestone bed,
many localities show worked
material. But this material
appears to be hardly more
satisfactory than that which was
deposited upon the plains, for the
rejects are numerous.
The most satisfactory
material for working appears to
have been that which was taken
out of its limestone bed by the users. Evidence of
such a quarry exists upon the head of Elm Creek in
Taylor County. Through the courtesy of the owner
of the land, Mr. K. Stoker, this site has been
investigated with the help of Carl Chelf, and a
number of interesting things were found.

Flint Quarry
First in interest are the flint quarries. For 2450
feet the hillside has been dug up, following the
outcrop of the flint bearing stratum, so deeply that
even now some of these trenches are three feet deep.
A test trench placed across the old ditches showed
that the flint bearing stratum was 8 feet deep where

Texas Archaeological and Paleontological Society

the digging was abandoned. Much of the diggings
may have been just as deep.

Flint Quarry Used by Pottery Makers

Two potsherds of the same buff colored ware
The removal of the overlying dirt probably was that is found elsewhere in this section were found
done by the use of large heavy axe-like flint blades in the camp site close to the quarry. Also other
and scrapers, a number of which were found on the artifacts were found here of forms typical of the
surface and nearby, and some in the old ditch where pottery sites, and it is likely that this flint was being
sought by the pottery users of this area.
the test trench was dug.
The material from this quarry was taken out in
large nodules after the embedding limestone had
been broken off by the use of stone boulders. Some
of the used hammerstones were found in the old
diggings and these were as large as a manâs head,
and were battered over the entire surface. Then the
flint apparently was broken into more or less thin
sections, if the great quantity of similar material
that lies upon the ground correctly tells the story.
Some of this work was done at the quarry site, but
more of it at the camps nearby. From these thinner
sections, the flint was further worked into large leaf
blades. Tons of flakes, and hammerstones, scrapers,
hearths and other evidences of occupation nearby
extend continuously for at least three miles along
Elm Creek. Few other specialized implements have
been found on the surface. From the number of
fragments of large leaf blades found, it seems that
this was as far as the work was carried in the vicinity
of the quarry. The same type of artifact is found
along Elm Creek for fifteen miles to the east, and to
the southeast some thirty miles away, where the
same kind of dark flint appears in abundance in the
camp sites, together with completed implements of
similar material.

Long Use of Quarry
This flint must have been used during a long
period of time. Many of the worked fragments are
heavily patinated, and at different places along the
course of Elm Creek below, artifacts are found in
the gravel deposits. Worked flint in place is found
at depths ranging from two to five and a half feet
below the present ground level. Yet in some of the
camp sites the flint is actually on top of the grass,
as though it might have been worked but yesterday.
Rock Circles and Rectangles.
In the campsite nearest the quarry is a series of
stone circles and rectangles that evidently formed
a part of the camp there. The smaller circles of

rectangles are of similar area. One large circle is
about 150 feet in diameter. So far as is known, no
other prehistoric remains like them are found in
this immediate section.
A similar circle of stones, approximately 300
feet in diameter is found on the eastern extension of
the area occupied, and about three miles from the

quarry. This has all the appearance of having once
been a low stone wall, such as sheep herders use
in building temporary corrals. But from a careful
search of the surface and from several test holes,
there is no evidence of white occupation or even
contact, and so far as it has been possible to verify,
no early cattle camps were located in this immediate
vicinity.

nearest the quarry, a test hole shows them to extend
for nearly three feet below the present surface.
Burial

Across the Creek from the circle of stones to
the east, a recent burial covered with stones, was
found in a rock crevice. Hair still clung to the skin,
and there was a fragment of some utensil of wood.
At this site the soil is filled with flint flakes, this might represent a Mexican rather than an Indian

Other Sources of Flint
The majority of the flint artifacts
found in this section (with the
exception of those found in the Sand
Dune sites) appear to have been
made from the nodules coming from
the Edwards limestone. But
numerous flint artifacts are found
near Abilene that are made of flint
that is not known to exist in place
here. These are the reds, banded and
brightly mottled materials, which
occur farther to the northwest. Yet it
is possible that the material for many
of these implements might have been
found upon the surface in the same
washed deposits, where so much of
the flint from the Edwards limestone
has been deposited. Here unworked
nodules of flint dissimilar to that
found in place in the Edwards
Limestone occur.

Texas Archaeological and Paleontological Society
Sand Dune Flint
The material that was used by the Sand Dune
people, did not come from any locally known
stratum in the Edwards limestone. This material is
either of a translucent grey agate, a light grey, or
most frequently of a rich light cream colored flint.
Nodules of the same kind of flint are frequently
found within the camp sites in the dune sand, but it

is not known whether they occur there naturally, or
have been carried there by the occupants of these
sites.
It may be that this material was brought in from
the southeast of Abilene where all of the flint
artifacts that have been examined by the writer are
of similar material.

THE PICTOGRAPHS AT THE HUECO TANKS
BY COLONEL M. L. CRIMMINS
There is a giant pile of granite known as the Hueco
Tanks thirty miles east-northeast of El Paso. These
tanks were a landmark for the emigrants to California
from 1849 on, and before that they had been used for
many centuries by various tribes of Indians.
Captain Randolph Marcy, 5th U. S. Infantry, in
laying out a new route from El Paso to Fort Smith,

He remarked about the great natural beauty of the
place and many Indian rock pictures decorating the
walls of the caves.
John Russell Bartlett, the chief of the AmericanMexican boundary commission, passed there the
following year and was much impressed with their
unusual geologic formations. He copied
many of the pictographs as shown in his
Personal Narratives, U. S. Mexican
Boundary Commission 1850-54.
Geology of the Area
This groups of rocks is an igneous
intrusion, forced up through the earthâs
surface many millions of years ago, which
accounts for their appearance in an upright
position. This happened long before the
Rocky Mountains appeared above the level
of the sea, and when a large part of the
present United States was covered with
water, from the Hueco Tanks to the
Labrador Shelf on the east. Therefore no
cretaceous animal life is found below these
rocks. These rocks form a great natural
amphitheatre, with huge rocks thrown upright in wild confusion, extending about a
mile in length, half a mile in width, and form
one hundred to one hundred and fifty feet in
height. Much of the granite is in place, while
huge boulders are piled up like pebbles on
the sides of the summit.
Favored Location
These tanks cover an area of about five
hundred acres, and the rocks are in three
groups forming a natural amphitheatre.
Water is usually found in some rock water
holes. This place has been a favorite resort
of the Indians since the earliest prehistoric

the animalistic types. It seems to have been
the custom of most of the primitive races of
America to take the names of animals singly
or in combination.
Pictographs
Many of the caves near the mortar holes
are decorated with pictographs. They are
usually of the following colors: Black, red,
white, yellow, and one green. The black
pictures are the most common and are made
from a paint composed of grease and
charcoal. The red pictures are from hematite
or cinnabar and the yellow ones are made
from an ochreous sandstone. The white was
made from either kaolin, gypsum, or lime.
The green pictures are characteristic of the
Navajo Indians of northern New Mexico
and Arizona, and their paint was made from
a copper oxide.
The groups of figures have been divided
into the symbolic, the meaning of most of

animal is usually recognized, and the

their hunt. Another is a huge red sun with a white snake
projecting upwards from it. There was one picture
found in this group of the human hand. This picture is
usually associated with the Basket Maker culture of
more than three thousand years ago. We also find some
pictures not unlike those of the Mayas of Yucatan of
about two thousand years ago. We have a picture
painted in red of a god-like figure wearing plumes on
his head. Others show circular numerals similar to those
of the Mayas and Aztecs.

âCouncil Chamberâ

There is a cave near the mouth of the amphitheatre
which has a large flat table-like rock that has been
worn smooth on top. It is the largest cave thereabouts,
and is called âThe Council Chamber Cave.â It has
two large white snakes painted on the wall and each is
over fifty feet long and about a foot wide. Bartlett
reports that the Indians held councils in the great
amphitheatre. On one occasion after the Indians had
committed depredations and murders around El Paso
they were trailed by the Mexicans to this amphitheatre.
They were driven to the far end
and then built a wall of rocks from

other. Here they were besieged
and being cut off from food and
water, they were eventually
overcome and one hundred and
fifty were killed.
A Site Worthy of Preservation
There are about two thousand
Indian rock pictures at the Hueco
Tanks. Many of these pictures
have been destroyed and defaced
by vandals, during the past eighty
years. Even Bartlett in his
âPersonal Narrative,â Vol. I,
pages 172 and 173 wrote as
follows in reference to the Indian
rock pictures:
âOver them are figures of
late travelers and emigrantsâ
who have taken this means to
immortalize their names and
let posterity know that they
were on their way to
California.â
There are few places in the
world where such an interesting
collection of pictographs can be
found in such an easily accessible
location. The State of Texas
should follow the example of other
States in preserving their
archeological sites for the study
of present and future generations.

Professor Osborn points out that the mammals of
the Quaternary have by no means progressed as far in
America as in Europe. It will be many years before
the succession can be worked out with precision.
According to Osbornâs arrangement there are three
successive Pleistocene faunas, two of which appear
to have coincided with interglacial stages, and the third
with the last re-establishment of glacial conditions on
a grand scale. The Mammalian fauna of the Quaternary
is almost wholly peculiar. It differs greatly from the
Tertiary fauna preceding it and the present succeeding
fauna. The species are, moreover, very numerous and
many of them are of extraordinary size, for it is the
culmination of the Mammalian age.

*Smilodon cf. Fatalis (Leidy).
A finely preserved occiput of a large sabre-tooth
cat is present. Its affinities with Smilodon are clearly
shown by the relatively great vertical extent of the
mastoid processes, together with their being directed
downward and forward so that the auricular fossa is
nearly closed below, whereas in Felis it is wide open
and the vertical extent of the Mastoids is relatively slight.
The occipital condyles are also Smilodon-like and show
a greater habitual range of vertical movement than in
Felis. All this is correlated with the great development
of the sternomastoid muscle in Smilodon for use in
striking its prey and is highly diagnostic of the genus.

Quaternary deposits occupy the greater part of the
El Paso quadrangle. The bases of the mountains are
buried by accumulations of debris and the Hulco

Rio Grande Valley is covered with river alluvium.
Pleistocene fossils have been found in the upper part
of the balson deposits. These deposits consist chiefly
of gravel, sand and clay derived from the disintegration
of the rocks of the highlands.

adapting their clothing and teeth to all
possible conditions of life. Thus the
romances of elephant migration and
conquest are second only to the romances
of human migration and conquest. Variety
is the spice of elephant life as it is of human
life. The reaching out in every direction
for every kind of food, every kind of
habitat, is in itself the cause of divergent
evolution and adaptation. So strong was
the migratory impulse that only six out of
sixteen races of Mastodons and elephants
failed to reach America.
Texas abounds in Mammoth remains.
Bones or teeth have been reported from
nearly every part of the State. Indeed, few
Counties are without Mammoth relics of
some kind.
The Mastodon
The Mastodon must have appeared
very much like any other elephant, though
a little shorter in the legs and somewhat
more heavily built than either of the living
species, while the head was a trifle flatter
and the jaw much longer. The tusks vary,
sometimes bowing outwards, sometimes
upwards to form a half circle. They were
never as long as the largest Mammoth
tusks, but to make up for this they were a
shade stronger for their length. The size
of the Mastodon has often been overestimated. Some say they did not attain
the height of a full grown African elephant.
In great contrast to the Mammoth were
the teeth of Mastodons. The crown or
grinding face of the tooth is formed by
more or less regular cone-shaped or
pyramidal-shaped projections, covered
with enamel. (See Plate 26 opposite Page
86, Volume 2, Bulletin 1930 Texas A. 8~

Serrate-Toothed Mastodon *( Serridentinus
Productus) Tree Browsing
The fossil remains of this species of elephant are
found in much older deposits than the Quaternary and,
therefore, it does not come under our assignment of
âQuaternary Mammals.â However, due to the fact that
the animal is a remarkable one whose history is equally
remarkable and better still, whose remains have been
found in Texas and only at one other place in North
America, the temptation is too great to pass up a brief
mention of such an animal, especially when ~such a
wonderful description is given by one of the greatest
authorities on fossil and living elephants, Prof. H. F.
Osborn. The Serridentines, or serrate-toothed
Mastodons have only recently, as a result of
investigation, become distinguished from the longjawed Mastodons on the basis of the structure of the
relatively few teeth found in other parts of the world.

length, a jaw more elongate than in the true Mastodons
but less elongate than in the extremely long-jawed
forms. The species, while very bulky, is by no means
as massive as the ordinary Mastodons nor as high.

From ancient river alluvium, sands and gravels in
terraces along the banks of the Colorado River in
Bastrop County, and the Trinity River in Liberty
County, comes fossil bones, skulls, horn cores of the

TEXAS TECH ARCHAEOLOGICAL EXPEDITION SUMMER 1930
BY W. C. HOLDEN
The archeological activities of Texas
Technological College during the past year have
centered around the attempt to explain the
relationship between the slab-stone house culture
along the Canadian River in the Panhandle of Texas
and the Pueblo culture of the Southwest.
Prior to this past summer no slab-stone ruins of
the Panhandle type had been reported on the Canadian
River west of Tucumcari, New Mexico. It seemed to
be a reasonable theory that if the Panhandle slabstone culture were related to the Pueblo culture there
should be some indications of such a connection
between Tucumcari and the Pecos valley. The most
eastern pueblo ruins reported on until the summer of
1929 were those on the Tecolote River about a mile
below the village of Tecolote on the Las Vegas-Santa
Fe highway. During the summer of 1929 Dr. J. Alden
Mason and party from the Museum of the University
of Pennsylvania reported the finding of a ruin near the
town of Watrous, N. M., located at the confluence of
the Mora River and Sapello Creek. In his report Dr.
Mason said in part: âIn architecture the site somewhat
resembles that on the Canadian (in the Panhandle),
the underground walls and floors being made of adobe
mud, but smooth and finished. However, instead of
enclosing single rooms, the walls were partitions
between rooms, and the group on the ground
excavated consisted of a dozen or more. The same
superposition of floors was noted and the same
charred beams and lumps of fire-baked clay with the
impressions of poles or reeds. The latter were
unusually frequent, and charred beams rare. In
contradistinction to the Texas site, potsherds were
common and flaked implements very rare; the country
evidently did not produce much flint. The pottery was
of unmistakable Pueblo type, mainly black corrugated
ware but with a fair quantity of painted black on white
and a few pieces of black on red.*
The discovery of a ruin almost mid-way between
the Pecos valley and Tucumcari resembling the

Canadian ruins in architecture and containing
unmistakable Pueblo potsherds made the possibility
of establishing a relationship between the Panhandle
and Pueblo cultures seem a little bit nearer at hand. It
seemed clear that the most vital region to work, in
attempting to solve this problem of relationships was
between the Tecolote River west of Las Vegas and
Tucumcari. It was decided to explore minutely the
intervening region for more ruins; then to begin with
known Pueblo and pre-Pueblo ruins on the Tecolote
and excavate typical ruins towards the east to known
Canadian ruins of the Panhandle type, noting where
and how the transition from the Pueblo to Panhandle
culture took place.
Tecolote Ruin
With a program like this in view the first camp for
the field school conducted by the College in July-August
1930 was made at San Geronimo Ranger Station on
the Tecolote River some eighteen miles west of Las
Vegas. From this place exploring expeditions were sent
out along the Gallinas and Tecolote Rivers, affluents
of the Pecos, and along Sapello Creek and Mora River,
tributaries of the Canadian. A number of slab-stone
ruins of the single room Panhandle type were found,
some within ten miles of Las Vegas. Mr. William Elfield
of that place was instrumental in locating these. Time
did not permit of the excavation of any of this type of
ruin in the Las Vegas vicinity.
Excavations at Tecolote
The second week of August was spent excavating
in a pre-Pueblo ruin on the Tecolote. There are three
known groups of ruins on the Tecolote River. The group
where we worked is located on the south bank of the
river about a mile below the Mexican village of
Tecolote. The ruins consist of ten mounds varying in
size from 24 feet to 180 feet and in height from 2 to 7
feet, and scattered over an area approximately 900
feet long and 430 feet wide.

TECOLOTE RUIN, DISTRIBUTION OF MOUNDS
Our work was confined to Mound A. The north
part of this mound has been carried away by the
riverâs washing the bank away beneath it. Here and
there along the perpendicular cliff can be seen cross
sections of walls of horizontal rock masonry.
Because of the fact that it is in immediate danger of
being carried away by the cutting back of the river,
we selected this mound for our excavations. A series
of three rooms on the west side of the mound and
adjacent to the river bank had already been
excavated by two ladies from Pennsylvania during
the summer of 1929. We were unable to learn their
names or whether or not their results have been
published. The walls are still exposed as they were
left. Rooms (a) and (b) are approximately 10 feet
square. Room (c) is approximately 7 by 10 feet.
The north wall of room (c) is still in place; the
north wall of (b) is partially gone and all of the
north wall of (a) has fallen into the river. The walls
of the rooms still standing are between 36 and 40

inches high and 10 inches thick, and made of
brownish sandstone. The most interesting thing
about these rooms is that they are built over an older
and more massive ruin. Cutting diagonally across
and running underneath room (c) about three feet
high, 12 inches thick and of the same material as
the upper walls is a wall but of far superior
workmanship. See wall x, y, z, in Figure 9.
Some 16 feet east of room (c) is room (d) which
was excavated by our party. This room is 15 feet in
diameter and semi-circular. The north part of the
wall has fallen into the river. A segment is gone out
of the part of the wall still standing. (The missing
segment is indicated by a dotted line on Figure 9).
The floor level in (d) was found at a depth of about
30 inches. Something like a half bushel of potsherds
were found on or near the floor level. Among them
there seem to be fragments of three whole pots
which probably can be restored. The sherds for the

most part are black on white and charred corrugated
ware with an occasional black on red. The floor
was made of small flat rocks covered with adobe.
The major part of our excavations consisted in
digging a longitudinal trench along the crest of the
mound beginning at the river bank and running 52
feet south, and a traverse trench 28 feet long cutting
the longitudinal trench about the center. For
convenience will hereafter refer to k o, l o, m o and
n o, on Figure 9 respectively as north trench, east
trench, south trench, and west trench.

Four boxes of potsherds and artifacts were taken
from the trenches. The material is now in our
workshop awaiting study regarding stratification.
Potsherds were plentiful and of the following kinds;
black on white, incised, and crude grey, coiled
cooking ware, fire blackened. It seems that the
amount of black on white becomes more scarce
towards the bottom.

from the position of what is left of the

that the main body of the ruins has been

The Tierra Blanca Ruin
On August 14 our party left Tecolote and went
to Hereford, Texas, where we spent four days
excavating. The ruins are located on a place owned
by Mr. Tom Ivy, eight miles east of Hereford on
Tierra Blanca Creek. These ruins were first
reported February 23, 1925 by Mr. Jobe H. Green,
amateur archeologist of Hereford. Mr. Green sent
Dr. H. P. Mera, at present, staff archeologist of the
Laboratory of Anthropology at Santa Fe, a
description of the ruins together with specimens of
potsherds of the true glazed type. Dr. Mera has since

32

insisted that Texas Technological College make a
more intensive investigation of the Tierra Blanca
Ruins. In view of the fact that decorated pottery of
true Pueblo type was found in typical slab-stone
ruins, it seemed probable that these ruins might
prove to be the âkeyâ that we have been searching
for to show the real relationship of the Panhandle
culture to the Pueblo culture. Accordingly we made
out plans to work a few days at Hereford. The
Tierra Blanca is a beautiful stream fed by springs.

Artifacts
The first layer of six inches contained four
potsherds, a few flint flakes, several fragments of
mussel shells, a few flakes of obsidian, and a
considerable quantity of broken buffalo bones. Of
the potsherds, three were glazed polychrome and
one was dark grey, plain cooking ware, fireblackened.

TEXAS COASTAL POTTERY
BY GEORGE C. MARTIN
The surfaces of many campsites in the coastal
section of Texas lying between Matagorda and Baffin
bays are littered with lumps of hard-baked and burned
clay. The pieces are irregular in size and shape, and
when found on the surface are usually much weathered.
Some show actual contact with fire and soot, others
being merely baked with heat.
In my early investigations of these campsites the
clay lumps were accounted for as the result of
campfires built directly on clay surfaces, but I began
to find them in places where they could not have been
created in such a manner. They were numerous in the
shifting sand-hills south of Falfurias and plentiful on
the sandy campsites on the north end of Padre island,
on the Live Oak Peninsula, and at Ingleside. They were
found on the surface and in the topsoil of blackland
campsites on Copano bay, and on Oso and Petronella
creeks. Occasionally they were found in shell-heaps.
In many cases they were in sand five, ten, even fifteen
feet above any clay strata, and on Padre island were a
mile or more from any clay. They contain no tempering
shell as do the sherds from pottery and were not residue
lumps of the paste from which pottery was
manufactured. Even when found on clay surfaces their
content of sand appears to be far greater than that of
the clay on which they rested.
Some might be accounted for as the remains of
clay coatings of fish cooked under the coals of fires,
such method of preparation being witnessed, and the
fish partaken of, by Mr. Sam Allardyce at a small Indian
encampment in the vicinity of Matagorda Bay in the
early eighteen-seventies, but it is doubtful if such
coatings would have been baked to such an extent
that they would not have long since disintegrated in
the moisture to which they have been subjected.
Manufacture of Pottery
Altogether, the lumps were very puzzling and the
reason for their existence did not begin to dawn upon
me until a freshly eroded bank on Oso creek, Nueces

county, yielded numerous unweathered baked and
burned lumps many of which had one smooth side.
Some of these surfaces were convex, others concave.
Several fitted roughly together and had certainly
formed part of a cast of the inside of a pot. Evidently
they had something to do with the manufacture of
pottery, but, there was still not enough evidence to
indicate the why and wherefor of them. Conclusive
evidence of the method of their creation and the reason
therefor was yielded by a site on a small island in the
Playa Lodosa, Aransas county (Site 81, Martin and
Potter âPreliminary Archaelogical Surveyâ). A heavy
downpour had deeply eroded the banks just previous
to one of my visits to the site and in one spot I found a
bed of baked clay-lumps in place. Other lumps and
numerous sherds were scattered over the newly
exposed surface. Where the lumps were bedded in
place they showed that they had once formed one solid
bed that had been crumbled by heat, and in the center
thereof were three hemi-spherical depressions wherein
the bases of clay vessels had once stood. Many of the
scattered loose pieces showed the convex and concave
surfaces previously noted on specimens from the bank
of Oso creek. Beyond question I had found a place
where pottery had been fired by Karankawan Indians
or by some coastal tribe which made pottery
corresponding exactly with that found on known
Karankawan sites.
Process of Firing Pottery
Close study of the refuse permits me to describe
the process of firing which was as follows:âAfter the
vessels had been shaped and dried, a shallow hole
was dug into the soil and the bottom of it thickly
covered with a specially prepared mixture of
dampened sand and clay put together in such
proportions that it could be readily crumbled after it
was baked. The pots which were to be fired were set
into this flooring and more of the mixed clay and sand
was introduced into the hole and packed around, in,
and over the vessels. The entire mass was then

34

Texas Archaeological and Paleontological Society

permitted to dry and fires were built over it and
kept burning until the desired result was attained.
After cooling the mass was picked to pieces, the
pots were taken out and the sandy clay removed
from their interiors in small lumps. The burned and
sooty specimens were those which had come into
direct contact with the fires on the surface, those
merely baked being from the interior of the mass
and the insides of the pots.
Confirmatory evidence that this was the actual
method of firing was found in the form of potsherds
from this same site which were given to Mr. Samuel
Woolford, connected with the Witte Museum, San
Antonio, for examination. Mr. Woolford succeeded in
fitting together and reconstructing about one-fifth of a
bowl and was surprised to find that the upper portion
was of a deep red color shading three to four inches
below the edge into dark brown. No better proof that
the heat had been applied from above the vessel could
possibly be desired. Some of the local clays contain
much oxide of iron and when pastes are made of such
the vessels attain a deep red color where the heat is
greatest, shading into dark and light brown where less
heat has been applied. Evidence that the practice of
filling vessels with packed sandy clay before burning
obtained as far inland as San Antonio was also found
by Mr. Woolford in the form of a cast of the interior of
the neck of a water-bottle of burned clay. This cast
was found in the soil in Brackenridge Park, in the
confines of the city.
Earthenware Handles
Gatschet states, in his work on the Karankawa
Indians, that pots with handles were unknown to this
tribe. This is incorrect. Earthen handles were rare, but
are occasionally found on campsites known to have
been occupied by Indians classified as Karankawan.
Specimens are included in the George C. Martin

Texas Coastal Collection in the Witte Museum, San
Antonio. Of this type of handle the four known
existing specimens show that they were attached
vertically. They were made by rolling the paste
between the hands until it attained the desired length
and thickness. Holes were made in the walls of the
vessel to which the handles were to be attached
and the two ends thrust through these to the interior
whereupon the ends were expanded by pressure
and merged into the walls of the pot with moistened
fingers. The final process was to mold the materials
of the handles and of the outside of the vessel
together by moistening and rubbing. Actually the
handles were riveted to the pot.
Handles of Fiber or Hide
The common type of handle used in the coastal
section of Texas was made of fiber or hide and run
through holes bored in the sides of the vessel and
twisted. Occasionally the holes were made in the walls
before the material had dried, pushed through with a
twig or fishbone, but the common method was drilling
after the vessels had been fired. Sherds show these
holes were made commonly about one half inch from
the edge. Sometimes only one hole was made on each
side of the vessel, sometimes two holes to the side,
these one-half to one inch apart. Cooking pots were
used in direct contact with the fire and when suspended
the fiber or hide handles were thickly covered with
clay which prevented burning. Such coverings of
handles were of a temporary nature as they did not
usually come closely enough into contact with the heat
to become permanently baked, but one specimen
about four inches in length and showing the impression
of a twisted cord having passed through it was found
by the writer on a Copano bay site in Aransas county.
Edges of potsherds that have been drilled for suspension
are quite common on coastal sites.

POTTERY OF THE EL PASO REGION
BY EILEEN E. ALVES
The pottery found in the vicinity of El Paso,
Texas, presents an amazing number of different
types. A collection of sherds made from one of the
wind swept, water washed village sites, about half
a mile long by a quarter of a mile wide, situated
within fifty miles of El Paso, will include a
representation of types known in Arizona, New
Mexico, and Old Mexico, as well as
types less widely scattered.
The sherds described in this article
are surface finds only, no known
stratigraphic work of any importance
having been done in this locality. Very
few refuse piles, or remains of buildings
suitable for stratigraphic work, have
been found in the ruins near here.
This paper is a mere statement of
pottery found, and does not pretend to
do more than report the many types of
pottery scattered on mesa and plain
within a fifty miles radius of El Paso.

Another common example here is the black on

from the beautiful black on white Mimbres. This
Chuperdero pottery is a familiar type of sherd on
our old village sites. The square base, the grey color
and the rough striated interiors as if done by a coarse
brush, and the rather crude decorations
are among its characteristics.

Polychrome
Mimbres is ordinarily found at
every site, which is true in a much
lesser degree with Casas Grande or
Chihuahua polychrome. It is generally
conceded that Mimbres is the older of
the two. The clear cut designs of black

naturalistic or geometric figures are of
extreme beauty.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL NOTES OF THE BIG BEND REGION
BY VICTOR J. SMITH
During the past few years, studies and surveys
conducted by the University of Texas and several
Texas scientific societies have established the fact
that Texas is an area containing a great variety of
cultural evidence, destined to become outstanding
in its contributions of knowledge concerning
prehistoric man in North America. Texas has within
its boundaries climatic conditions that range from
almost tropical to conditions in many respects equal
to the northern portion of the temperate zone. This
paper deals with the Big Bend area, that section of
the State lying west of the Pecos River
The importance of the Big Bend, or Trans-Pecos
section, as an archeological field may readily be
visualized if a map is consulted and its relationship
with districts to the east and north determined,
together with the fact that it either borders on, or is
a part of, the Southwestern Division.

nearly like those of the Southwestern states than
other parts of Texas to the east. Naturally such semiarid conditions have been favorable to the
preservation of specimens which, in many sections
would have long ago perished. Such dry weather
conditions, together with a rugged topography, offer
numerous sites where fragile materials have been
preserved in a bone dry state for many years.
Mountains in the vicinity range from 300 to 3,000
feet above the adjoining plains or valleys with their
peaks from 5,000 to 9,000 feet above sea level.
The rock shelters found in these mountains will be
mentioned in a later paragraph. The many caves in
limestone or âlavaâ rock, however, offered unusual
opportunities for shelter; the mountains provided
conditions of refuge not usual to a level country;
game abounded in the section; and springs and
mountain streams, always provided a much more
sure supply of water to the Indian than a casual
observance of the country today would lead one to
believe.

So far as possible accurate records have been
made covering sites in this section of the State. It
is important that complete ones be secured before
the damage or entire loss of materials make
investigations impossible. For example,
pictographs in certain localities are being rapidly
obliterated by vandals, and treasure hunters are
digging into much valuable scientific material with
no thought of the havoc being wrought to
anthropological research. The records referred to
include field notes, maps, drawings, photographs,
and museum specimens. Sites from which such
evidence has been gathered number 168 and range
in size or importance from small open camps to
extensive sites indicating habitation for possibly
thousands of years.
Open Camps
In a discussion of open camp sites, it should be
said that the Big Bend is known as an Apache
country and that the Mescalero branch of the tribe
is supposed to have occupied the section as far back
as authentic history can trace. The very geographic
location of the area, however, has always made it
subject to forays, migrations, and hunting
expeditions. History records the fact that the
Comanches from east of the Pecos river made
inroads into the Apache territory. As Texas became
more settled, these inroads became more frequent
until finally the Davis and Chisos Mountains
became the scene of the last stand of the Indian in
Texas, the last group of any numerical importance
being driven out of the Big Bend in 1870.
Many of the open camp sites show evidence of
scant use, therefore, these may have been occupied
by the Comanches, who were unused to the rock
shelters and preferred tents with other forms of
prairie living. There can be little doubt that the
Comanches, when traveling quickly as they often
did used the caves for temporary occupation. Types

of artifacts yielded by the open camps are: metates,
manos, scrapers, arrowheads, and some rocks with
lines or inscriptions. Rock circles still mark the
location of tepees. Burnt rock mounds are found in
abundance but as a rule there is no evidence of
extensive camping in the immediate vicinity.

in all of the larger caves and the bones of deer,
bear, and antelope are rather common. Implements
made from bone are restricted to the awl type.

The rock shelters which have been mentioned
are found in canyons, at the faces of bluffs, or at the
top of the talus. The most important of these sites
take the form of long open shelters with overhanging
rocks which afford protection, or they are caves
extending back into the rock. All of the caves, save
a few with irregular rock floors, are covered with
litter from six inches to six feet in depth. The last
mentioned type of shelter varies from ten to thirty
feet in width at the mouth and from ten to fifty feet
in depth. Such shelters, of course, afford unusually
good protection from the weather (many of them
face south). Indians often added to the comfort and
safety of these shelters by building walls in front
or by closing undesirable openings with rough
masonry or rock piling.

The characteristic pestle is circular in cross
section (usually broken when found) and generally
from eleven to fourteen inches long when
undamaged. The point or nose is the distinguishing
part, being round, and slightly pointed with an
evident worn surface. At one location where the
rock was rather hard red sandstone, the smooth,
almost polished, surface of the rock indicated
clearly long contact with the human body just as
may be observed at the mouth of narrow caves.
This glossy surface indicated that the squaw sat
flat with legs on each side of the mortar hole while
she did the laborious work at the mill.

As this is being written additional types of smaller

yet, neither classified nor studied.
(b) Sacks, nets, storage sacks, and containers.
A variety of woven articles evidently used to carry
children, store or carry food, or for the burial of

Ornaments
Another important phase of ethnological study
is that of the ornament, since it represents the most
advanced progress made by Neolithic man.
Possibly beads form the most important group in a
study of ornaments as they relate to the section under
discussion. The specimens collected range from a
single piece to as many as 70 found in one grave.
These beads fall, according to size, shape, and
material, into the following groups:

(c) Mats. Several types of weave and edging.
(d) Sandals. With thongs, vary in sizes from
child to man. Most of these specimens are badly
worn but a variety of weaving methods may be
observed. No leather footgear was found.
(e) String and rope work. Hundreds of short
pieces of string have been found in the caves. These
range in size from 1-16â in diameter to Â½â. Two
types of manufacturing include a three strand spiral
twisted string and a three strand plait of smaller
string.

1. Tubular, cylindricalâthigh bone of fowl.
2. Short cylindrical boneâquite smooth and
sometimes polished.
3. Discoidal beadsâbones.
4. Round and Oval beadsâturquoise.
5. Seed beadsâelliptical shapeâholes size
of pin.

In some cases beads are found strung on a cord
but usually the string has long since rotted away.
One of the tubular bone ornaments is marked with

indicate that the fiber was softened in this manner
Pendants
before being twisted into string.
Large numbers of specimens include more
roughly made materials used for tying. While there
is no fishing in the district away from the Rio
Grande, some of the finer materials suggests a net,
possibly for catching rabbits.
Other Cave Artifacts
Other items in a typical list of cave finds include
charcoal, ochre, crude salt, paint balls, gourds (one
18â high and decorated, evidently a grain storage),
small corn cobs, firewood, cactus hulls, ashes,
acorns, Spanish walnut shells, flint chippings, rocks
used about the camp fire, crayon, and coils of fiber.
These coils, sometimes with strings holding the
material in place, resemble pot rests or basket rests
but may have been merely materials held in storage.
The very limited pottery finds indicate late
imported specimens or only the crudest beginnings
of pottery work.

Closely associated with beads as ornaments are
pendants, two classes of which have been observed.
The largest group in size is typically of a triangular
shape wrought from a rather soft white stone. Next
in size are the ovate type varying from Â¾â to 1Â½â
in length and about 3-32â thick. These are usually
made from materials resembling shell but they do
not reflect colors like mother-of- pearl.
Charms
Another group of specimens border upon a
classification between ornaments and pictographs.
These are charms, pocket pieces, and problematical
articles. Among them are found a stone article about
the shape of a small doughnut; the shoulder blade
of a deer inscribed with tiny black figures of snakes,
animals, and conventional lines; a hemispherical
stone carved with lines indicating the eyes, nose,
and mouth of a man; flat oval stone objects with
painted figures; and polished pebbles.

Pictographs

The paintings more commonly found are
pictographs. It should be said the Big Bend is a
fertile field for the study of pictographs. Their
abundance is probably due to an excellent supply
of cinnabar and other pigments and partly because
of sheltered rock surfaces which have preserved
the drawings. Twenty-three sites have been
recorded which have pictographs in varying
numbers. Most of the pigments are red (cinnabar).
Other colors, in order of numbers and importance,
are: Orange, white, yellow and black. In many cases
crayons were used to apply the color, in others a
brush. Handprints were sometimes sprayed from
the mouth or the hand dipped for the process.
Two great divisions include the types of
drawings used. These are the geometric forms in
one group and the figures of men and animals in
another. In the former are found dots, circles,
rectangular shapes, lines, arcs, spirals, triangular
shapes, and many elaborate combinations, possibly
representing maps or conventionalized forms
conveying messages to those familiar with their key.
Animals, sometimes most realistic in their
expression of action, form a large group and the
human figure another. Hunting scenes in which both
appear are frequently observed but weapons of the
hunt are primitive and not those of European
influence. In fact, with the exception of but two
locations, one of these quite minor, there is to be
found no white influence among the pictographs
messages left by ancient man. Speculation as to the
age of the pictographs is fruitless but evidence

indicates that they reach back to basket maker times.
Some locations reveal old painting superimposed
upon one or two layers still more ancient.
Petroglyphs
Of still greater age are the petroglyphs,
laboriously pecked upon the rock by hand, which
are often so old that the once fresh lines are so
dimmed with age that they are traced with difficulty.
Only two petroglyph locations are important, but
these are extensive and present valuable fields for
study.
Pottery
It may be said with some certainty that the Big
Bend Indians did not make or use pottery to any
extent.
Basket Makers
This brings us to our most important conclusion,
namely, that there is constantly accumulating
evidence in the deeper finds representing a culture
so closely resembling Basket Maker that
anthropologists are warranted in considering a
major portion of the Big Bend well within the area
admitted as basket maker territory. Space forbids a
detailed tabulation of evidence bearing upon this
point but future investigations will show the same
evidences over an area extending to the east as far
as the Devilâs River and the Pecos Valley.

Many Post Basket Maker sites
recorded show later occupation by
the Plains tribes. Many of the Post
Basket Maker sites are entirely
covered, their presence being
indicated by sherds, flint, etc.,
carried to the surface by rodents.
The Post Basket Maker sites are
characterized by masonry and
pottery. Some of the sites consist
of only three rooms; one site is
known to have 55 rooms and the
rooms in all of the sites will vary
from six or seven feet across to
twenty or thirty feet, and are usually
square or rectangular in shape.

pottery is coarse, heavy ware,
tempered usually with mica, but
sand and shell were also used as

types are found.
The inside of the pottery is
smooth and is covered both inside
and out with a slip which is most
frequently either of a dull greenish
grey or black, and less frequently
of a light red. The majority of the
sherds are heavily blackened with

However, a rock ledge facing south, 8 to 15 feet
high and extending for several hundred feet, in the
immediate vicinity of the shelter in which the burial
was found, has been extensively used. This ledge
shows a heavy accumulation of debris along its
entire base and there is evidence of a Post Basket

Burials
Three or four types of burial occur within this
area.

Some burials occur with the skeletal remains

One burial accompanied by metal artifacts and
glass beads was found in soil, along a small water

A similar burial was also found accompanied

Pictographs and Petroglyphs
Both incised and beautifully painted rock
pictures are found in this area, a great number of
them occurring at the rock shelter site described in
this paper.
Flint Mine
Flint mines have been located at two places in
this section.
Site No. 58 is an unusually large agatized
dolomite quarry. Most of the flint is in brilliant
colors. Evidence indicates that thousands of tons
of this material have been taken out. A birdâs eye
view from a distance shows the top and sides of
the mesa to be pock-marked with large excavations,
which extend for six tenths of a mile. Many
workshops adjoin the site for a distance of a mile
or more.
Such mines are not very plentiful in Northwest
Texas, although there are several outcroppings of
agatized dolomite on the north aide of the Canadian
river, but none of them were worked so extensively
as this one. This prehistoric quarry is located within

RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCHES
IN THE ABILENE SECTION
BY DR. CYRUS N. RAY
PREHISTORIC TEXAS BURIALS
SANDSTONE RECORDS OF ANCIENT MEN AND ANIMALS
The Stone Grave People

Another Stone Grave

Late in 1930 Mr. W. J. Van London and the
writer were kindly granted permission to make
archeological examination of the De La Fosse ranch
by the owner, Mr. George De La Fosse. At this
place Hubbard Creek turns north and crosses the
paved highway between the towns of Albany and
Breckenridge, Texas at a place ten miles west of
Breckenridge. On the west side of the bridge and
on the south side of the road the ground rises
gradually at first, and then steeply to a high rocky
ridge which parallels the east and west course of
the creek at this place for a mile or more. All along
the foot of the hill are gullies and where these cut
through the rather high north banks of the creek
are exposed outcrops of a stratum of camp site
debris which lies buried under ten inches of soil. It
consists of burnt rocks, numerous mussel shells,
flint flakes, hammerstones, manos, metates,
scrapers, and a few heavily patinated broken
projectile points. These artifacts have a thick white
shell of patina on the outside with blue flint centers.

About a half mile farther up the same side of the
creek in a high bank the writer, on a later trip,
observed small portions of the edges of three flat
stones projecting from the soil slope. Upon digging
these out another oval enclosure of flat stones set
on edge was found and again the center was filled
with long flat stones set horizontally and below
these also rested a skeleton lying in the flexed or
embryonic position which also had the head to the
west and facing the south and the hands on either
side of the face. There were no artifacts in the grave
although as before there were many flakes of rotten
mussel shells and considerable charcoal mixed in
the soil, however there were no signs of fire on
either bones or stones.

While we were examining this site the writer
noticed about an inch of what appeared to be the
rounded edge of a metate projecting out of the
ground. Upon digging this out, it was found to
consist of one half of a broken metate setting on
edge which was one of a small oval enclosure of
buried flat stones set on edge. The center was found
to be filled in with more flat stones laid horizontally.
When these were removed to a depth of two feet a
skeleton was exposed which was lying on its right
side with the head to the west and facing south.
The knees were flexed and the thighs flexed on the
body. The arms were flexed and the hands rested
on each side of the head.
The broken metate set at the head was the only
artifact found although many rotten shell flakes may
have been remains of shell ornaments.

Stone Grave Skeleton Exposed by Erosion
Mr. L. A. Beyer living four miles northwest of
Abilene has a valley field which was crossed by the
meanderings of a small creek branch which was
usually dry. A few years ago he dug a ditch four
feet deep through the valley to straighten the stream.
After a heavy rain a skeleton in good condition
washed out of the bottom. Mr. Beyer realizing that
the bones might be of scientific interest excavated
them carefully and brought them to town. The
writer secured these bones and visited the site with
Mr. Beyer. This skeleton from all accounts lay in
no special order, nor was it in a stone grave. Stream
erosion had washed it out of the bottom of the ditch
at a depth from the surface of four feet. It came
from an old valley floor level which has since been
covered with that depth of soil. At this four foot
level at several other places along the same ditch
erosion had exposed small hearth rings composed
of burnt stones three or four inches in diameter and
flint flakes. Also a few portions of broken flint
artifacts had eroded out. This skeleton had all the

peculiar anatomical features of the other
Stone Grave skeletons. Its absence from
the typical grave is unexplained;
however, the frontal bone on each side
just above the outer ends of the orbits
shows six long deep scratches in the
bone, three over each eye as though they
had been made by some cat like animal
in trying to scratch out the eyes. The
wounds must have been quite severe.
Burial in Waterless Camp Site
Ten miles south of Merkel, Texas is a
small dry creek branch of Mulberry
Creek which carries no water except
immediately after rains, however this
creek branch has a quite extensive old
camp site on both of its banks. The larger
part of the camp debris lies on a neck of
high ground left between two creeks
where another smaller creek joins
Mulberry creek. From all evidences this
camp site has been covered with
considerable soil since its abandonment
but the reverse process is now under way
and its margins are being gullied and
washed away. The site shows several
burnt rock mounds of smaller size, and
erosion has exposed an almost
continuous layer containing burnt rocks,
mussel shells, flint chips, manos,
metates, scrapers, hammerstones, knives
and many of the larger sized so-called
arrow heads (they may have been atl atl
heads).
The site bears every indication of
having been the permanent camp site of
a populous village over a considerable
period of time. There is now no spring,
water hole, nor permanent water supply
within many miles of this site. During
the greater part of the year this site
presents an appearance as dry as that of
any part of this section. Either the site
must have existed when climatic
conditions were more moist and such

small branches contained permanent water, or a
spring on the site has vanished. It is certain that no
primitive camp site could be maintained there now.
This burial also was under a stone grave made very
similarly to the others. The skeleton also lay in the
flexed position with the head to the west but in this
case the face was turned to the north. The bones

were small and contained all of the peculiar features
of the type.
Lying against the ribs on the right side were the
remains of a tortoise shell and beside them and also
in contact with the ribs was nearly all of one side of
a large mussel shell; this shell was polished
somewhat on the outside and the hinge projection
had been sawed off even with the inside
rim of the shell and polished smooth. This
shell probably had been in use as a spoon.
The skeleton lay about two feet deep,
covered by the rocks which were almost
entirely covered with soil, and the general
appearance seemed to indicate that soil
accretion had covered almost all of the
grave stones since the burial so that there
was little on the surface to indicate its
location. The level on which the skeleton
lay appeared to have been an old
occupied floor level and was full of flint
flakes. At a distance of eighteen inches
north of the skeleton and on the same
level a crude patinated flint drill or awl
was found.

The four skeletons from the sites
described above are so similar that the
same description will fit all of them.
While found in three different places
separated many miles apart the racial
anatomical peculiarities in these four
skeletons show more agreement in
characters than one could reasonably
expect in the nearest relatives.
The first skeletons found in this region
having anything like comparable features
were the two very primitive skeletons
found under six and one-half feet of
horizontally laid undisturbed clay strata
on the Clear Fork of the Brazos River
near Albany, Texas and described in The
Scientific American of May 1929 issue.
The skeletons then found were
incomplete in that parts of the ends of

case the other end of the other bone was usually
intact. By comparisons the shape of the whole shaft

were very wide spreading. The lower molar teeth
of some jaws were worn down very much from
the outside edges in a peculiar manner.

These skeletons were buried in stone
graves and were lying in flexed position
facing south and with the hands lying on
either side of the face.
The striking features of these
skeletons were as follows: the skulls were
long and narrow and the eye brow ridges
extremely heavy, the shin bones or tibiae
were nearly flat on cross section, the thigh
bones or femora were curved or bowed
from front to back similar to neanderthal
femora, the forearm bones or radii were
curved and the lower jaws were massive,
with heavy much worn teeth. These two
skeletons were of people of good size and
height and were heavily constructed in
all of their parts.
Similar to Clear Fork People
The method of burial of the Clear Fork
people was the same as that of the
diminutive Stone Grave People. The
peculiarities of the Clear Fork People
were all present in the Stone Grave
People in modified or lessened degree
except that while the Clear Fork People
were large, heavy and tall, the Stone
Grave People were very small.
The Stone Grave People all had
unusually heavy eyebrow ridges but theirs
were not as extremely developed as those
of the Clear Fork People. All had antero
postero curvature of the femora, all had
flattened tibiae, all had short thick lower
jaws with much worn teeth, and all had
low foreheads and long narrow skulls.
The writer would not describe the chins
as being as prominent as those of the
modern Indians but still they had chins.
The ascending rami of the lower jaws of
all were unusually wide and short. The
lower jaws while short from front to back

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

Probably Descendants of Clear Fork People
We have thus seen that the four Stone Grave
People have the same anatomical characteristics in
somewhat lessened degree as the Clear Fork People
and also used the same type of burial customs. The
difference in the earth levels or strata in which they
lived would indicate that this type of man lived in
the Abilene region throughout a long period of time
before being superseded by the more modern type.
Long enough indeed to become both very much
smaller in size and less brutal in appearance.
However the Stone Graves themselves and
associated camp sites are well covered with soil
except where erosion has exposed them. The
associated flints when broken show a blue flint
center and a thick shell of white patina going into
the stone rather deeply. Thus we not only have
extreme patina but in one case a total disappearance
of a water supply adequate for a large village, which
facts would seem to indicate that even the Stone
Grave People lived very long ago.
Fortunately whole femora and tibiae and nearly
whole skulls were found of this race. The femora
and tibiae of both legs of the skeleton found on the
Beyer place were in good condition.

bird or blow gun points had been found above it
prior to its exposure by the sand being blown off of
it.
Another skeleton was excavated in the bottom
of a sand blow out in Callahan County where the
sand had blown off down deep enough so that the
skull was smashed by the farmerâs plow. On digging
below the skull fragments the skeleton was found
sitting upright but also arranged in the flexed
position described previously.
Sand Dune Skeletons Also Peculiar
It appears that bones are not preserved in as good
condition in the sand as are those in clay soils,
however the writer has examined skulls and long
bones from four Sand Dune Burials and is able to
state that in each of the cases examined the skulls
were long and narrow with heavy lower jaws and
much worn teeth. The eyebrow ridges were
unusually prominent and there was a marked antero
postero curvature of the thigh bones. The articular
ends however were usually too much decayed to
make any comparisons of the joints.
Peculiar Egg Shaped Skull

In the 1929 issue of the Bulletin the writer
described the finding of a skeleton having a small

People With Bent Knees

A Sand Dune skeleton was found by the writer
exposed in the bottom of a sand blowout near
Hawley, Texas. This skeleton lay in the usual flexed
position with the head to the north and facing east.
No artifacts were found with it but numerous small

Femoral Curvature Common in Texas
The writer has some much curved femora sent
him from near Rockport, Texas (on the Texas coast)
by Mr. George C. Martin. The writer also has in his

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

55

collection a markedly curved femur found in a stone
covered grave by a farmer at a site four miles
northeast of Abilene. The skull was given to some
country doctor and the writer never was able to
trace it or get a description of it.

a report on this unusual site was printed in the 1930
issue of the Society Bulletin. The eighty-five oval
or boat shaped mortar holes found were not only
of an unusual shape not previously described, in so
far as the writer knows, but a majority showed
evidences of such extreme erosion of hard stone
that one is justified in believing them to be very

old. It was then noted that a few of the mortar holes
Thus we see from the numerous instances cited
which were situated near the centers of the large
that the peculiar anatomical features described
above were not instances of disease
or of accidental or monstrous
deformation but were instead racial
features of wide territorial
distribution which probably existed
during a long period of prehistoric
time.
Since stone age hearth site strata
of prehistoric man have been found
by the writer extending from
present soil levels down to depths
as great as twenty-four to twentyseven feet below the present soil
surface, along streams of the same
region, we should expect to some
time find the remains of a kind of
man of an even more brutal type
than any yet found.
Sandstone Records of Ancient
Men and Animals
Among the most convincing
evidences of ancient man in Texas
are the records he left in the hard
sandstone ledges near his ancient
camp sites. The deep erosion
shown by hard sandstone ledges
filled with mortar holes which were
so situated that nothing but natural
rainfall and wind erosion could have
operated on them is very
interesting.
Two years ago the writer
investigated a site on the Douthit
Ranch located thirty-five miles
southwest of Colorado, Texas and

stones had evidently been filled at an early
date with wind blown soil in which a grass
sod had grown which had protected them.
These were from sixteen to seventeen
inches deep and from fifteen to seventeen
inches long and eight inches wide at the
centers. The sides sloped to points at the
ends. Their general shape was similar to
the inside of a canoe. However those nearer
the sloping edges of the ledge had eroded
away in varying degrees down to some
which only showed the bottoms of holes
which were only one and a half inches in
depth.

Recently Mr. W. J. Van London stated
that he believed that he had found three
other oval mortar hole sites of the same
type in the same County. While on the way
to these three sites yet another oval mortar
hole site was found by the writer and Mr.
Van London on two low sandstone ledges
just above Champion Creek, situated on
each side of a dirt road which parallels the
Bankhead Highway a mile south and three
miles west of Loraine, Texas. On the north
side of the road two oval mortar holes were
visible on the exposed pert of a ledge which
was mostly covered with soil and it is
probable that more holes are covered up
there. Across the creek on the south side
of the road is a ledge in which sixty-five
oval and five round mortar holes were
counted. Most of the oval mortar holes in
this site were eroded badly and exhibited
indications of extreme age and erosion
similar to those of the Douthit Ranch. A
new feature was the presence of the five
round holes. It is probable that the round
holes are the work of people of a later
period as they are in a much better state of
preservation wherever found, than those of
oval type.
A peculiar thing noticed at this site was
that the edges of many of the eroded oval
mortar holes remained considerably higher
than the surrounding rock surfaces as

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society
though the substance which had been ground in
them had gone into the walls of the holes and caused
them to become harder than the surrounding
sandstone so that the stone between them had
eroded more rapidly. A white substance still adhered
to the insides of some of the holes.
The Seven Wells Site
We then visited a site situated on Champion
Creek seven miles southeast of Colorado, Texas.
Here a smaller creek joins Champion Creek and
both have channels through steep vertical walls of
sandstone. In the stone bed of Champion Creek
there are several large deep well like holes from
which there is a spring flow of water in even the
dryest of seasons. The writer had often heard of
the existence of buffalo tracks or trails worn into
the solid rocks leading down to the water at this
place but was not prepared for the sight which
confronted him. It appears that there were three
places in the steep banks where the bison could go
down to water. Converging on these were five well
marked bison trails which evidently had been made
by thousands of buffaloes following each other in
single file down to water, each carefully stepping
into the others tracks.1 This had gone on throughout
ages of time until the hard stone was worn away by
the countless hoof beats into deep individual tracks
showing the shape of the buffaloes hoofs in the
rocks. Even the two parallel grooves worn in the
ends of the holes, as the cloven hoofs were
withdrawn from the holes, remain plainly showing.
In most places the stone has been worn down into
trenches or trails with the holes in the bottoms but
at one or two places there are rocks in the trail
which show no trenches but the tracks go across
these and connect at each end with the track filled
trenches. One of these stones with a raised slightly
convex sloping surface has five evenly spaced tracks
on it. These track holes are from six to eight inches
deep. No buffaloes have existed in the region since
the seventies, yet the foot track holes are as
symmetrical and rounded as though just made. One
of the track trails was sixty yards long, one was
forty yards, one was twenty-six, one fifteen, and
another ten yards long.

57

This must have been a place of considerable
interest to primitive man, there is a camp site on
the higher land above it which contains much flint
debris. Just below the Indian camp site and on a
slightly higher level of the ledge just east of the
animal track holes, are a large group of oval mortar
holes made in bed rock. At this and several other
smaller groups nearby, eighty-five oval, and three
round mortar holes were counted. At this site also
the oval mortar holes showed the same indications
of extreme age and erosion as those previously
reported. The three round holes at this place were
also in good condition. One peculiarity of the two
types of mortar holes noticed by the writer was
that he never has seen oval mortar holes except in
large groupings. On the contrary he never has seen
a group of round mortar holes exceeding seven in
number. The usual number is four or five and this is
true whether found alone or in association with a
large group of oval holes.
There not only were numerous mortar holes to
be found in the bed rock ledges at the Seven Wells
Site but also several typical portable shallow
sandstone slab metates of the type so common near
Abilene were seen in local collections. The manos
were also of similar forms. It is possible that this
form of portable milling stone represents a third
period of occupation by peoples using grinding tools
besides the round and boat shaped mortar hole
peoples. Where this phase comes in is not nearly so
evident as the relative ages of the two types of
mortar holes.
Colorado River Site
From this place we proceeded to a stone quarry
on top of a high hill above the Colorado River. This
is situated one half mile west of Colorado, Texas.
Here there was a smaller oval mortar hole site on
the ledge on top of the hill. The holes were on the
opposite side of the top of the hill from the River.
This seems peculiar when there were accessible
ledges on the River side of the hill top.
Many of the mortar holes at this place have been
destroyed by road building quarry operations but
some still remain.

four stone hammers in the two large Abilene
collections three were found close to Colorado,
Texas.
It is understood that such hammers are
frequently found in that region. In so far as the writer
knows none have ever been found within fifty miles
of Abilene despite its abundant camp sites at
different levels going back to a remote period. The
problem of what were used as pestles in the oval
mortar holes is yet unsolved, they may have been
made of wood.
Study of the associated artifacts and of the
territorial distribution of each type of mortar holes
should shed much light on the distribution of ancient
Texas cultures.

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society
San Saba County Mortar Holes
On a trip with Mr. J. F. Morrison one hundred
and fifty miles southeast of Abilene four relatively
well preserved round mortar holes were found on
Mr. William Motesâ place located eleven miles north
of San Saba, Texas. These holes were in a flat ledge
of limestone in the bed of a small creek branch.
Immediately above them on a slight rise of ground
was a typical Texas burnt rock mound thirty-five
feet across.
On a later trip to the place with Mr. Henry Dixon
a hole was dug in the center down to the original
white lime soil. The mound was forty inches thick
and contained small burnt lime stones, much
powdery coal black earth and occasional mussel
shells. No artifacts and few flint flakes were found.
Whether it was built by the round mortar hole
people or not cannot yet be determined but the
evidence is suggestive. On another similar ledge
located about a hundred yards farther up the Creek
are the remaining bottoms of two typical boatshaped mortar holes. What is left of these holes are
now only one and three-fourths inches deep. If these
holes were originally fifteen to seventeen inches
deep like some well protected holes on the Douthit
Ranch it must have taken a tremendous lapse of
time for the infrequent flow of water of this usually
dry creek branch to have worn the whole surface
of this hard limestone ledge down to that extent.

top and tubular on cross section. The average hole
is ten or twelve inches deep and seven or eight
inches in diameter at the top.
At Paint Rock, Texas, situated seventy miles
south of Abilene and in the burnt rock mound area,
are four round mortar holes located on a ledge of
rock on the west side of the north end of the River
bridge. Near Paint Rock is a notable collection of
Indian rock paintings which press reports say are
soon to be destroyed.
It is a sad commentary on our state of culture
when prehistoric remains of such great scientific
value are permitted to be destroyed in quarry
operations when usually such regions are full of
unpainted limestone of no scientific value. It is
probable that some of the paintings at Paint Rock
are rather ancient. A gully immediately below them
has exposed hearths fifty-three inches below the
surface.

Round mortar holes have been reported from
the Alpine region hundreds of miles southwest of
Abilene by both Mr. Victor J. Smith and Mr. Henry
J. Fletcher. Mortar holes of undetermined type have
been reported from the Pecos River region. Dr. J.
Alden Mason stated to the writer that he had
observed some oval type mortar holes in New
Mexico near a shelter. Mr. E. B. Sayles has reported

FIELD WORK OF MEMBERS
Mrs. R. B. Alves, of El Paso, reports that the
activities of herself and some other members of
the El Paso Archeological Society have been
mainly devoted, during the past year, to the
gathering and recording of potsherds in her district.
Archeological evidence in many of the sites in that
area is rapidly disappearing through present use of
the land. Approximately forty sites have been
located which contain pottery.

his investigations along the Texas Coast in the
vicinity of Corpus Christi.

Sam Chamberlain, of Refugio, is carrying on a
survey of the Coast from the mouth of the Colorado
River to the Rio Grande.

Mrs. Annie Moran, of Weatherford, reports that
many sites are to be found in Parker and adjoining
counties, but little research has been made in this
part of the State. Metates and manos, and mortars
and pestles are found; the projectiles are finely
made. One stone object, highly polished, was
found, drilled with two holes, one from each side.
The positions of these holes does not suggest that
the artifact was an ornament, and Mrs. Moran
believes it was part of a fire-making implement.

Colonel M. L. Crimmins, of El Paso, has devoted
most of his time during the past year, to giving
lectures on archeological and historical subjects.
Pictographs of the Hueco Tanks, Chronicles of the
Aztecs, Zuni Folk Tales, and History of the Messila
Valley are some of the topics covered by Colonel
Crimmins in lectures, and talks over the radio.

Dr. J. E. Pearce and A. T. Jackson, of the
Department of Anthropology, University of Texas,
have had an expedition in east Texas throughout
the summer. It is hoped that the results of Dr.
Pearceâs investigations will be made public at an
early date as he has been carrying on researches in
different parts of the State for a number of years.

Henry E. Elrod, of Houston, reports a survey
made in Uvalde County. Between thirty and forty
middens were examined, without excavation. No
pottery or bone was found. The middens consisted
of burnt stone, ashes, and charcoal and many were
quite extensive. One covered an area between three
and four acres and was about 6 feet high. Curiosity
seekers had hunted for arrow heads, but had left
the principal artifacts, consisting of scrapers,
knives, hammer-stones, etc.

During 1931 Dr. Cyrus N. Ray has made one
trip to San Saba County and three trips to Colorado,
Texas, for the study of mortar hole sites.

The common type of artifact found was a type
of scraper made from a thin flake of flint and
roughly shaped with the cutting edge retouched in
a symmetrical arc.
The territory covered extended over both
branches of the Frio River from Concan up Frio
Canyon to the head waters thereof.
George C. Martin, of Rockport, and Mr. S. W.
Woolford, of San Antonio, have headed a small
expedition to the Big Bend, section for the Witte
Museum at San Antonio. Mr. Martin has continued

In Taylor County, a covered site has been found
in the highest and oldest terrace of a stream. Far
above the present flood water level of the adjoining
stream, and five feet below the present ground level
is a hearth of burned rock, charcoal and ashes,
overlaid with horizontally deposited beds of clay
and gravel. A new stream bed and terrace have been
formed below the terrace in which the hearth is
located.
Two additional sites in which mammoth bones
occur have been found.
Many additional surface archeological sites have
been located, three of which contained pottery
sherds.

found. There seems to be little flint in this
area and many artifacts have been made
from quartzite. Manos and metates are
found.
E. B. Sayles, of Abilene, reports that
during the past year his work has been
largely exploratory. He has located and
plotted thirteen new sites in this section.
The principal of these are: A large campsite
occupied by pottery users, covering
approximately fifteen acres, and showing
evidence of longer occupation than other
similar sites recorded by this observer.
Two small rock shelters have been found,
and a dual burial in a rock mound grave
located on a high point. One of the burials
had been almost entirely destroyed by
cremation, and many of the bones of the
other likewise charred. A new site at which
numerous mammoth bones are eroding out,
has been located, and from the condition
of these bones it appears that this is an
original deposit and not a redeposit as is
frequently the case with similar bones found
in gravel.
Field trips have been made in the
Abilene section with Dr. Cyrus N. Ray for
the purpose of photographing several of his
sites.
An exploratory trip was made to the sand
dune area to the northwest of Odessa where
a number of sites discovered by T. J. Kellis
of Wickett were visited. Here black on white
pottery was found.
Several days were spent at Amarillo
looking over some of the numerous sites
located in that section by Floyd V. Studer.
