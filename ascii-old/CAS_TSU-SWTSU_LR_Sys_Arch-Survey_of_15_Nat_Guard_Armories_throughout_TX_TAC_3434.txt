Abstract
The Center for Archaeological Studies was contracted by the Texas Army National Guard to
conduct a systematic archaeological survey of 15 National Guard armories located throughout Texas.
The current archaeological survey was conducted during the months of May through August of
2004 under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 3434. C. Britt Bousman served as the project’s Principal
Investigator, while Project Archaeologist Abby Weinstein oversaw all fieldwork. Approximately 255
acres were examined through systematic pedestrian survey and the excavation of shovel tests. The
entire survey yielded no significant archaeological sites and it was recommended that no further
archaeological investigations are warranted. A National Register eligibly assessment of armory
buildings are presented in a detailed study of the standing architecture conducted by the National
Guard (Williams 2005a, 2005b).

Introduction

Project Archaeologist Abby Weinstein oversaw
all fieldwork, which was conducted by Abby
Weinstein, Kody Potts, Jacob Hooge, and David
Peyton.

During the months of May through August of
2004, a systematic phase one archaeological survey
of 15 National Guard armories was conducted
throughout Texas (Figure 1). Approximately 255
acres of property were surveyed within the confines
of these armories. The project was conducted
by the Center for Archaeological Studies (CAS)
under the supervision of C. Britt Bousman, who
served as the project’s Principal Investigator.

Project Description
This survey was conducted under the
auspices of Texas Antiquities Permit No. 3434,
and it complied with guidelines of the Texas

investigations. No archaeological sites were
encountered.

Coastal, Plains, and Caddo regions (see Collins
1995; Hester 1995; Pertulla 1995).
The historic and architectural significance of
buildings, structures and objects associated with
the Texas Army National Guard program between
1945 and 1958 were the subject of an architectural
study conducted by Diane E. Williams in 2005.
This investigations examined the development
of the Texas Army National Guard program and
related properties within the context of state and
national military policies and programs. Fifty
facilities were visited and documented by Williams
(2005a, 2005b) in which physical attributes,
historical background, associated Texas National
Guard programs, and the potential for National
Register of Historic Places listing were described
and discussed (see National Register assessment
of buildings; Williams 2005a, 2005b).

The purpose of the current survey was to
ascertain whether archaeological resources could
be adversely impacted by construction activities
in the project area. This was determined by
the presence or absence of cultural materials
within the selected armory property boundaries.
Armories investigated included: Arlington,
Atlanta, Baytown, El Campo, Hondo, Houston,
Laredo, Mexia, Midland, Nacodoches, Rosenberg,
Saginaw, Stephenville, Temple, and Witicha Falls.
The majority of the armories were 10–20 acres in
size. With the exception of the Houston and Midland
properties, all the armories were considered to
be up to 60 percent disturbed by construction of
buildings, roads, drainages, ditches, and trash
piles. The Houston and Midland properties,
however, were devoid of existing structures and
were noticeably less disturbed, which allowed
for a greater potential of intact archaeological
materials. Therefore, these areas were considered
to have a medium probability of archaeological
remains, whereas the majority of the remaining
properties were deemed low–medium probability.

Evaluation Methodology
Data collected during survey of the 15
National Guard armories was to be used to
evaluate the properties for eligibility for listing
in the NRHP; however, the study results were
negative. Evaluation for listing in the NRHP was
to be conducted because areas surveyed were
within National Guard property boundaries.

Environmental and Cultural
Background

When federal jurisdiction or funding is
associated with a cultural resource survey project,
all sites surveyed must be evaluated for nomination
for listing in the NRHP. Criteria for nomination
extend to both historic and prehistoric properties.
Criterion include the demonstrated quality and
significance in American history, architecture,
archeology, engineering, and culture that is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures,
and objects that possess integrity of location,
design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling,
and association and:

The 15 armories are located in 13 separate
counties that stretch from the Rio Grande to
the Red River. A great diversity of locations and
environmental zones are represented in these areas:
South Texas Brush Country, Blackland Prairie, East
Texas Piney Woods, Gulf Coastal Prairie, Mixed
Grass Prairie, and the Cross Timbers. Because
of this environmental diversity, a wide range of
archaeological sites and depositional environments
are also likely to be encountered. Archaeological
culture areas include: South Texas, Central Texas,

made significant contribution to the past; or

appropriate provenience information recorded.
The number of shovel test units excavated at each
armory was calculated according to the survey
standards issued by THC.

significant persons of the past; or

or that possess high artistic values, or that 		
represent a significant and distinguishable 		
entity who’s components may lack
individual distinction; or

Laboratory Methods
All excavation forms, maps, drawings,
photographs, and field records were processed and
prepared for curation in accordance with Federal
Regulation 36 CFR Part 79 and Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory standards. All field notes,
forms, photographs, and drawings, in addition to a
copy of this report, were turned over for curation to
the Texas Army National Guard.

prehistory.

Survey Methods

Results

The primary goal of this investigation was to
ascertain the nature of archaeological deposition
within armory boundaries. This was accomplished
through the implementation of a 100 percent
systematic pedestrian survey and the excavation of
shovel tests at each armory. The geomorphologic
setting and depth of encountered cultural resources
were recorded for each armory.

A total of 15 days of fieldwork resulted in
the excavation of 140 shovel tests (Figures 2–17).
All shovel tests were negative. No archaeological
materials of either prehistoric or historic nature
were encountered in the project area.

Conclusions and
Recommendations

Shovel test units were placed at 60-m or 120m intervals, depending on whether the area was
considered to have a medium or low probability
of archaeological materials. The maximum depth
of all shovel test unit was 50 cm; however, some
were terminated at shallower depths for reasons
such as impenetrable bedrock, roots, underground
utilities, or modern trash piles. The location of each
shovel test was recorded by a Trimble GeoExplorer
GPS and plotted on a detailed schematic of the
property. Stratigraphic profiles were described
and recorded using a standard shovel test form,
and any encountered artifacts were collected with

Based on this investigation, no archaeological
resources were identified on the National Guard
properties in the project area. As no archaeological
sites were identified, CAS recommends no further
archaeological investigations.
