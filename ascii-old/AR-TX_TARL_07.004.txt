INTRODUCTION
This report is intended to present the results of various
specialized research efforts directed primarily at refining the
analysis of collections made during several seasons of field
work in the Amistad International Reservoir area, Val Verde
County, Texas. This major salvage program has been carried out
under a number of cooperative agreements between the National
Park Service and the Texas Archeological Survey (formerly the
Texas Archeological Salvage Project), The University of Texas at
Austin. Specifically, the information presented herein is that
cited by the terms of Memorandum of Agreement No. CX 7000 3 0221.
Most of the results presented will not be interpreted at
length as the information derived from these various analyses
is designed for use in final reports currently in preparation.
The only field work specified under terms of this contract
was further investigation of two previously designated sites
in the Comstock and Rough Canyon Development Areas in the
Amistad National Recreational Area. Both of these sites are
endangered by these recreational facilities. The results of
our field observations at these two localities are included
as a section of this report.

RADIOCARBON ASSAYS:
ARENOSA SHELTER AND CONEJO SHELTER
Arenosa Shelter (41 VV 99) and Conejo Shelter (41 VV 162)
represent two of the better stratified archeological sites
investigated during salvage operations in the Amistad Reservoir
area. Arenosa Shelter, an extremely deep site now inundated by
the reservoir, was excavated during portions of three field
seasons. Only the results of the first season has been reported
(Dibble, 1967); final reports on the additional field seasons
are in preparation. Conejo Shelter, a dry rock shelter .located
in a short tributary canyon near the Pecos River Rio Grande con­
fluence, is the subject of a recently completed Ph.D. dissertation
by Robert K. Alexander (1974).

Three series of radiocarbon dates from Arenosa Shelter
have been previously published (Valastro, Pearson and Davis 1967;
Valastro and Davis 1970a; 1970b). Commentary on the initial
series of dates has been supplied by Dibble (1967). Conejo
Shelter had not been dated by radiocarbon methods previous to the
determinations provided for under terms of this contract.
A total of 21 dates listed below have been provided by the
Radiocarbon Dating Laboratory, The University of Texas at Austin,
and the Radiocarbon Laboratory of the Smithsonian Institution.
Both of these series are scheduled for eventual publication in
the journal Radiocarbon; the results here have been made available
through personal communication with these laboratories.

From Stratum 11 (general) yielding materials characteristic
of a late phase Middle Archaic assemblage.
Comment: Date overlaps within one sigma of two previously
dated samples from this stratum (Valastro, Pearson and Davis
1967) and compares very favorably with dates derived from
samples associated with typologically similar materials at
Bonfire Shelter (Dibble and Lorrain 1968) and Nopal Terrace
(Sorrow 1968) in.Jthe Amistad Reservoir area. In terms of radio­
carbon years, the chronological position of these materials
appears well established.
3600±70 B.P.
2650 B.C.

TX 1975 (Arenosa 618)

From a lens occurring in middle portion of Stratum 23, an
occupational layer yielding a predominantly Middle Archaic
assemblage. Portions of this stratum show evidence of redeposition;
however, the physical integrity of this particular lens ~s an
essentially intact primary depositional feature is considered
highly probable.
Comment: Date is in general accord in terms of a one
sigma overlap with underlying TX 324 and a two sigma overlap
with overlying TX 287 (Valastro, Pearson and Davis 1967: 444).
2

TX 1979

4450±150
2500 B.C.

From Feature 13 hearth, a discrete structural feature
associated with Stratum 28 and in primary association with a
late phase Early Archaic assemblage. One-half of this sample
was submitted to the Smithsonian Institution Radiocarbon
Laboratory (see Smithsonian listing below for comment).
5520±280
3570 B.C.

TX 1976 (Arenosa 163)

Sample from a general charcoal collection from Stratum 28.
Comment: Date does not overlap within two sigma range
of underlying TX 660 (Valastro and Davis 1970a; 26a) or over­
lying TX 1979 (see above). Sample TX 1979, from a discrete
feature associated with Stratum 28, appears to be nearer the
true age for this deposit.

Smithsonian Institution Dates
2l30±l05
180 B.C.

SI 1394 (Arenosa 156)

From the basal portion of Stratum 5 yielding a typologically
consistent assemblage of Late Archaic materials.
Comment: This date is in excellent one sigma agreement
with sample TX 537 originating from this stratum and dated
by the Texas Lab (Valastro and Davis 1970a; 268). Strati­
graphically, Stratum 5 falls in the mid-range of Late Archaic
deposits at the site.
SI 1395 (Arenosa 153)

2l65±70
215 B.C.

From Stratum 7 (general) yielding a consistent assemblage
of previously defined Late Archaic artifact forms.
Comment: Date is almost identical to TX 536 (200 B.C.;
Valastro and Davis 1970: 268). This determination provides
positive support for previous date and stratigraphic assumptions
made in the field.

3

SI 1396

2785±75
835 B.C.

From base of Stratum 9, a layering yielding materials con­
sidered diagnostic of late phase of Middle Archaic.
Comment: Date somewhat older than expected and not internally
consistent with SI 1397, a sample dated from lower stratum (see
below).
SI 1397 (Arenosa 584)

2540±75
590 B.C.

From Stratum 10 (general), yielding predominantly artifacts
considered diagnostic of the Middle Archaic period.
Comment: Date is consistent with estimates made on the
basis of previously dated series.
4685±lOO
2735 B.C.

SI 1398 (Arenosa 658)

From Stratum 21 (general) yielding Middle Archa

diagnostics.

Comment: Date is much too old for its stratigraphic position.
The magnitude of this apparent error is sufficient to suspect mis
labeling of sample in the field.
3350±85

SI1403 (Arenosa 650)

l400SB~C.

From Stratum 22C, a minor yielding non-diagnostic cultural
debris only.
Comment: Sample submitted to check on stratigraphic
assumptions made in the field. The derived date is consistent
with expectations made on the basis of relative depositional
position in the column.
4465±110
2515 B.C.

SI 1399 (Arenosa 167)

From Stratum 23B, the uppermost deposit at the site yielding
Early Archaic materials.

4

Comments: Date somewhat older than expected but overlaps
in the two sigma range with Texas date from a closely associated
layering, Stratum 23D (TX 324~ Valastro, et al. 1967: 444).
3875±55
1925 B.C.

SI 1402 (Arenosa 613)

From Stratum 25 (general) which yielded typical Early
Archaic diagnostics.
Comment: Indicated age is somewhat younger than anticipated
but is internally consistent with the balance of Smithsonian
dates from lower stratigraphic positions (see SI 1400 and SI
1401 below).
SI 1400 (Arenosa 170)

3985±110
2035 B.C.

From Stratum 25B, the lowermost lens of Stratum 25.
Archaic lithic diagnostics were associated.

Early

Comment: Date agrees well with samples originating from
above and below locus of this sample.
S1 1401

4630±lOO
2680 B.C.

From Feature 13, a discrete fire hearth associated with
upper surface of Stratum 28 (a thin layering of cultural debris
yielding Early Archaic lithic diagnostics).
Comment: Sample represents approximately one-half of
eld sample; the balance of this sample was dated by the Texas
Lab at 4450±150 B.P. (TX 1979, above). Dates thus overlap with­
in one-sigma and together apear to provide strong estimate of
the radiocarbon age of Stratum 28.

Sample originated from Lens 38 and was associated with
the first appearance of Ensor type projectile point, a Late
Archaic time diagnostic.
Comment: Date somewhat early when compared with radio­
carbon age of Ensor producing strata at Arenosa Shelter.
TX 1761

1360 B.C.

From Lens 50, a stratigraphic unit associated with Val
Verde type projectile points. This type is considered
diagnostic of the Middle Archaic period in the lower Pecos
River region.
Comment: DAte appears appropriate when compared with
strata from Arenosa Shelter which have produced Val Verde
type materials.
TX 1763

5020±80
3070 B.C.

From Lens 87, a vegetal layer associated with the upper­
most deposits yielding Pandale type projectile points. This
1S considered diagnostic of late phases of Early Archaic period.
Comment: Indicated age is generally within time range of
Panda1e point popularity suggested at ~renosa Shelter but
appears much too early for late manufacture of this style in
this region.

TX 1762

From Lens 103, a vegetal layer associated with Pandale
type projectile points. This sample derived from the approximate
center of Pandale producing layers.
Comment:

Date overlaps within one sigma of TX 1763 (above).

TX 1760

4890±90
2940 B.C.

From Lens 115, suggested as dating the approximate begin­
ning of Pandale associated deposits at this site.
Comments: This date, TX 1762 and TX 1763 all overlap' within
one sigma. A literal interpretation of the age correspondence
in Pandale producing layers suggests the possibility of a rapid
build up in deposits during this occupation.

NOTES ON CHRONOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT
AT ARENOSA SHELTER
All radiocarbon dates reported for the first time in this
letter as well as previously determined date series listed in
Figure I are given without use of "correction" factors. They
are provided here as reported by the laboratories; dates are
based on the original 5,568-year half life and not corrected
for possible fractionation nor correlated with assumed changes
through time of the atmospheric inventory of e14 02 (e.g., see
Ralph, et al. 1973). A more complete assessment of radiometric
dates from Arenosa Shelter now in preparation will consider
these possible corrective adjustments at some length.
In evaluating the general radiocarbon assay at Arenosa
Shelter it is clear that a basically sound "absolute" time scale
for certain of the stylistic and technological changes throughout
Archaic period can be derived. This chronology should be of
utility and application in the lower Pecos and immediately
surrounding regions.

Although in a comparative sense the date list at Arenosa
Shelter is internally consistent--and in this quality appears
to reflect the generally well demonstrable physical strati­
graphy--there are significant variations in the assumed depo­
sitional and post-deposition environments from stratum-to­
stratum which appear to have affected the "integrity" of any
given deposition unit. These effects seem to be reflected in
the results of the radiocarbon assay. For purposes of illu­
stration, the cultural deposits may be categorized into one of
the following:
(1)

Cultural debris of limited thickness deposited on
a compact, fine-grained fluvial deposit and sub­
sequently mantled by a similar deposit by low
velocity flooding of the site. The occurrence of a
few strata in the stratigraphic column allow con­
siderable confidence in assuming close contemporaniety
of associated materials and features under these
circumstances. Examples include Strata 7 and 11.
Interestingly, each of these hase: been dated by three
laterally separated samples which overlap within one
sigma of their stratigraphic equivalents.

(2)

Thick occupational accumulations without significant
additions of sterile fluvial deposits throughout~the
span of accumulation. In cases such as Stratum 9,
much of the volume of the matrix represents human­
induced intrusions: fire-fractured rock, ash, shell,
etc. The resultant matrix lacks coherence and inten­
sive foot traffic on various surfaces would theoretically
contribute significantly to mixture. Unusual anomalies
in the dates of three radiocarbon samples from this
stratum may have resulted from this effect.

(3)

Occupational debris accumulations which show evidence
of partial redeposition due to water action. Examples
in the Arenosa Shelter column include Strata 21 and
23. In the case of Stratum 23, stratigraphic evidence
indicates partial deposition on an angular unconformity.
Considerable variability in the dates of samples
collected from these layerings may be due to this
post-depositional environment.

The deep deposits at Arenosa Shelter owe much of their
generally excellent definition to periodically deposited layerings
of fine-grained alluviam resulting from past rises in the Pecos
River and/or Rio Grande drainages. In the majority of cases this
flooding appears not to have disturbed the condition of extant
cultural debris; in a few instances, however, erosion by flood
waters has clearly been distuPted'~. Other stratigraphic irregu­
larities within stratigraphic units are assumed to have been
9

contributed to by intensive human activity on surfaces lacking
sufficient coherence. The radiocarbon series from Arenosa Shelter
seems to be sufficiently sensitive to reflect such variations in
depositional and post-depositional environments.

RESULTS OF FAUNAL MATRIX PROCESSING
AND SEDIMENT SAMPLE ANALYSIS
Faunal Matrix Processing
A series of raw matrix samples from Arenosa Shelter were
processed. These samples were relatively small, averaging
about one gallon in volume; they represented one series of
previously unanalyzed matrix samples resulting from controlled
field collections. The intent of this processing was to aug­
ment, if possible, the numbers of small faunal specimens from
this site which are presently available for study. During
excavation of Arenosa Shelter, faunal recovery was largely limited
to materials found during basic coarse mesh (1/4 inch) screening.
The results, therefore, were biased toward the larger fauna.
The procedure used in this matrix processing was as follows:
Matrix was sieved using HIO and #18 (U.S. standard) mesh sizes.
All matrix~materiils~ailer thin 'IB m~§h was poured back into
the origifial bag and ret~itied 'for polsible later" use. The
remaining matrix 9 ~v8ragiyg~ahout[a~eequjIDter~ef~tfue total sample,
was washed in #10, #18, and #35 mesh sizes. After the matrix was
dried, bones and teeth were picked out with the aid of low
power magnification. All potentially identifiable elements were
picked out with tweezers and placed in labeled plastic vials.
The residues were also saved.
Table 1 provides the results of this processing. Genus
and species ident ications of specimens listed in the table
are limited to those which could be identified confidently with­
out lengthy study. Samples are listed in the table in their
stratigraphic order of occurrence (youngest to oldest),

A REPORT ON TWO SITES IN THE COMSTOCK AND ROUGH
CANYON DEVELOPMENT AREAS, AMISTAD NATIONAL RECREATIONAL AREA
Field work associated with this Memorandum of Agreement
was limited to further investigation at two localities reported
initially by Bruce A. Anderson, Southwest Region, National Park
Service, in a survey of areas to be affected by the planned
Comstock and Rough Canyon Development Areas (Anderson 1973).
41 VV 430
This site consists of a series of at least six definable
fire hearths surficially exposed on a caliche flat and situated
generally east of a small, rounded, ~solated knoll rising approxi­
mately 50 feet above the general level of the surrounding terrain.
The site is located approximately 0.7 miles due north of the
former course of the Rio Grande at an elevation of about 1,190
feet msl; it occurs between two shallow left bank tributaries of
an ephmeral unnamed drainage entering the Rio Grande mainstem
canyon 0.6 miles upstream from the mouth of Rough Canyon (map
references: USGS 7.5 preliminary series IIMouth of Pecos NE" and
"Feely NW").
The observed hearths varied from well-patterned, generally
circular enclosures made up of angular, highly fossiliferous
limestone spalls (Fig. 2) to scattered concentrations of like
materials (Fig. 3, right center). The ground surface, an
unsorted matrix of yellowish silt, angular pebbles and eroded
fossil shell appears to have been severely deflated: over the
entire extent of the site. Some of the hearthstones, for example,
were pedastled.
Maximum observed diameters of six defined features varied
from 2.5 to 7.5 feet. An examination of three hearths indicated
that charcoal relatable to utilization was minimal and not suf­
ficient for dating purposes. A widely dispersed scattering of
chert flakes was observed in general association with the
features; nQ collection was attempted since it was felt that
erosion of this surface had seriously affected their original
position.

Figure 2.

blocky, angular fossiliferous limestone
rock fragments, measures approximately 3.5
feet in maximum diameter.

,.

Geologically, the area of the site is included with the
area mapped as Buda Formation. The ledgy outcrop forming the
top of the nearby hill (and the apparent source of the hearth­
stones) is indicated as Boquillas Formation (Sharpe and Freeman
1965) .
Most, if not all, of the observed structural features
appear to be of aboriginal origin. The associated lithic debris
(including a dart point fragment collected by Anderson during
the initial survey) seems sufficient to demonstrate significant
aboriginal usage of the site. Because, however, of the known
occurrence of upland sheep herding camps prior to the 1930's in
this region, it is possible that some of the visible debris is
of the late historic age.
Although knowledge of this site does add materially to the
evidence of aboriginal utilization of the uplands in the Amistad
Reservoir area, its presently eroded condition seriously limits
its potential for further productive investigation.
41 VV 426
This site consists of an extensive (approximately 150 x 1,000
feet) surface exposure of chert debris in the area to be modified
in the Rough Canyon Development Area. Presently this exposure
extends to the north and south of the access road and lies partly
within the already modified parking lot area. The locality was
initially recorded by Anderson (1973) and subsequently inspected
by a field crew of the Texas Archeological Survey (Prewitt 1973).
The results of the latter inspection are summarized below.
An intensive examination of the surface over the entire area
failed to find any definite, recognizable artifacts or flaking
debris of unquestionable human origin. Natural cobbles of chert
and a few flakes were noted but no examples of bifacially worked
edges were found. Test probes indicated that the clastic deposits
were thin~-rarely extending to as much as 10 cm. in depth. Although
this examination did not negate the possibility that the locality
was a source area for chert, no evidence of on-site chipping (as
in the production of preforms) was encountered.
Similar appearing lithic accumulations, most of which include
a high percentage of rounded chert cobbles of a quality suitable
for tool manufacture, are known to occur in spotty conce"ntrations
adjacent to the major streams at elevations of a few feet to as
much as 300 feet above the present stream levels. These accumu­
lations have been roughly mapped as "terrace gravels" and are
presumably of Pleistocene age (Freeman 1966). Although these
upland gravels have not been systematically investigated from
an archeological standpoint, casual observations have indicated
that these deposits were used to some extent as lithic source
17

areas by aboriginal populations. No detailed geological
mapping of the Rough Canyon area is available; it is probable,
however, that Site 41 VV 426 includes a reworked exposure of
these gravels.
Since the intensive examination of the site failed to
demonstrate significant human utilization, no further investi­
gation is recommended.

SUMMARY AND COMMENTARY
The results of various analyses carried out under terms of
this contract vary in their immediate archeological utility.
All have, however, contributed information (positive or negative)
which will be of use to current or future studies in the general
Amistad Reservoir area.
The addition of 21 radiocarbon dates from stratified con­
texts at Arenosa Shelter and Conejo Shelter are of immediate
and significant usefulness in evaluating the traditionally held
time scale for Archaic developments in the area. In large,
these new dates have strongly supported the existing column at
Arenosa Shelter and have supplied a basic radiometric time scale
for the cultural sequence at Conejo Shelter.
The faunal matrix processing, although not as productive in
terms of number of identifiable animals as had been hoped, adds
to the existing collection and tends to remove some of the in­
herent bias which resulted from the limited use of fine mesh
recovery techniques in the field. In general the results of
this analysis support the general impression developed during
excavation at Arenosa Shelter, i.e., that differential preser­
vation through time has occurred. This factor must be accepted in
any assessment of human subsistence changes or in use of faunal
data per se in judging paleo-environmental shifts.
An appendix to this letter report by Dr. Vaughn M. Bryant
details the results of additional processing of pollen samples
from Arenosa Shelter. The poor preservation or visibility of
pollen grains in the samples was disappointing; Dr. Bry~nt con­
cludes that the environment at the site was not conducive to
pollen preservation at the level required for analytical purposes.
Presumably this would also be the case at other riverine-alluvial
terrace localities in the region. This negative information
should influence future investigations of the Quaternary pollen
record to concentrate efforts at other locality types.

Dear Dave:
This represents a progress report concerning our pollen studies of
sediments from Arenosa Shelter. It does not represent a final report or
our final efforts in this project.
As you recall, an extensive attempt to recover fossil pollen from
Arenosa Shelter was decided upon because of the great importance of this
site and the overall importance of the Amistad Reservoir area. Past attempts
at pollen studies in the area had proven successful at Bonfire Shelter
(41 VV 162) and at the Devils Mouth Site (41 VV 188). However, attempts
to recover pollen from the Devils Rockshelter (41 VV 264), Eagle Cave
(41 VV 167), and 41 VV l62-A did not meet with much success due either to
a lack of preserved pollen or excessive amounts of charcoal in the samples.

Unfortunately, our hopes of using the pollen record from Arenosa
Shelter as a method of reconstructing the past environment of the region
has not met with much success. A total of 63 pollen samples from many
areas of the site were each subjected to careful analysis yet only 19 of
those samples contained fossil pollen. The remaining 44 samples did not
contain preserved pollen or had excessive amounts of charcoal thereby
preventing an analysis (see enclosed list). I shall attempt to count the
remaining 19 samples which contained some fossil pollen and I will present
you with a final report of my findings later this year.
The material we collected was ample and I have material remaining
from each sample should you wish these unused portions returned. The pro­
cedures I utilized incorporated approved laboratory techniques developed
over the past several decades for pollen analytical studies. These
consisted of a number of basic steps:
1)

Screening to remove large pebbles, shell fragments, and other
detritus.

2)

10% HCL to remove calcium carbonate.

21

3)

Heavy density fluids to remove coarse-grained silicates.

4)

HF to remove fine-grained silicates.

5)

Acetolysis to remove non-pollen organic residues.

6)

15% KOH to reduce charcoal concentrations (in many cases
the charcoal was so excessive that this step did not achieve
the desired results).

After processing was completed each sample was carefully examined under
a microscope. This examination showed that a few samples contained at
least some fungal spores and pollen while other samples were totally void of
both spores and pollen or contained so much charcoal that further analysis
was impossible.
The inability to use most of these samples for pollen analytical studies
could have resulted from any, or all, of the following causes:
1)

The almost total absence of pollen and the presence of at
least some fungal spores suggest the possibility of some
pollen destruction from fungal attack.

2)

Repeated wetting and drying of the sediments in 41 VV 99
would speed the breakdown and oxidation of non-carbonized
organic materials, such as pollen.

3)

The presence of charcoal in many of the samples suggests the
repeated use of fires within the site area. This would also
tend to speed pollen destruction.

4)

Alluvial sediments in general (but not always) tend to be
low in fossil pollen yield due to a mechanical weathering of
the organic fraction.

During the course of my analysis I processed some samples twice to
make certain that pollen loss and/or destruction was not occurring during
any phase of my procedure. In addition, I made wet mounts of each soil
sample before using any chemical treatment to see if pollen was present.
In summary, I believe that the environment of deposition at 41 VV 99
is not conducive for the preservation of most pollen. As such, I would
suggest that additional attempts to recover fossil pollen from that site
will also result in similar failure. I regret not being able to send you
more positive results, as I realize this is an important archeological site.
However, when .the destruction of fossil pollen is severe, it is impossible
to conduct a total analysis.

I would like to suggest a possible alternative project which I
would be willing to undertake should you be able to help secure the
needed samples. Past experience has shown that Bonfire Shelter does con­
tain pollen in most strata and I believe that additional analyses of those
sediments could offer us a more detailed explanation as to the paleo­
environmental changes which took place in the general Amistad Reservoir
area. These data from Bonfire Shelter could then be used to formulate
some general statements as to possible similar changes at Arenosa Shelter.
Beyond this, I do not know how we can obtain more fossil pollen data from
that region unless some new archeological sites are located and excavated
within the Amistad Reservoir area or in nearby adjacent regions.
