Archeological Resources Survey—City Grand Prairie Proposed Robinson Rd Waterline, Dallas County, Texas

ABSTRACT

On March 19–21, 2019, archeologists from AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra) conducted an
archeological survey of a proposed 8,870-foot long (16.3 acres) water pipeline starting east of
President George Bush Turnpike (SH161) along Robinson Road and terminating at the intersection
of E. Gramley Drive and SE 4th Street in the City of Grand Prairie. Fieldwork was conducted to comply
with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) and the Antiquities Code of Texas
(ACT) under Antiquities Permit 8769. Thirty subsurface shovel tests and three mechanically
excavated trenches revealed no cultural material in the proposed project footprint. Field staff found
a survey area with dense clay and some areas of urban fill, with minimal potential for containing
archaeological material. One potential historic structure was identified within or near the APE during
pre-field background research and this location was targeted for a 100 percent pedestrian survey at
5m interval transects. No extant remains of structures, features or artifactual evidence of historic
occupation were encountered during this intensive field survey; no additional subsurface testing
within the vicinity of this area of interest was warranted. Based on the results of the survey,
AmaTerra recommends that no further work is warranted and that the proposed project should
proceed with no Historic Properties or State Antiquities Landmarks affected. All notes and forms
generated while conducting fieldwork will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION

This report details the results of an archeological survey for the 8,870-linear foot proposed Robinson
Road Water Line within the City of Grand Prairie in Dallas County, Texas (Figure 1). Over three days
of fieldwork, March 19 through 21, 2019, archeologists conducted an 100% pedestrian survey and
excavated thirty shovel tests and three mechanical trenches along the proposed project’s footprint.
All subsurface testing yielded no historic or prehistoric cultural material. AmaTerra recommends
that the proposed project has minimal potential to adversely impact significant archeological
resources and should proceed with no further work or coordination required.

1.1

Project Description

The proposed Robinson Road Water Line is located East of President George Bush Turnpike (SH161),
beginning in the West along Robinson Road and terminating in the East at the intersection of E.
Gramley Drive and SE 4th Street in the City of Grand Prairie. The project consists of the installation of
8,870 linear feet of new water pipeline which runs roughly parallel with Cottonwood Creek in its
entirety, and crosses over Cottonwood Creek near its eastern terminus just south of E. Gramley Road
(Figures 1 and 2).
Freese and Nichols, Inc. (FNI) is the City of Grand Prairie’s engineering contractor for this project.
The proposed pipeline is to be installed within a 30-foot-wide permanent easement along with a 3050-foot wide temporary construction easement (up to 80 feet [24.2 meters] wide total). This
undertaking is proposed on land managed by the City of Grand Prairie, a governmental jurisdiction
of the State of Texas.

The project will use a combination of open-cut trenching and subsurface bores under three water
crossings. Open-cut trench components will be installed to a depth of approximately 9–15 feet (2.7–
4.6 meters) below the ground surface within a 7-foot-wide (2.1 meter) trench. Bores will run
approximately 25 feet (7.6 meters) below the ground surface with sending and receiving pits being
approximately 20 feet (6.1 meters) wide.

1.2

Management Summary

Project engineers have identified that the water line’s Cottonwood Creek crossing will require an
Individual Permit under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act to be issued by the United States Army
Corps of Engineers (USACE). This permit calls for federal-level cultural resource regulatory oversight
outlined in Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (Section 106).
In addition, the City of Grand Prairie owns and manages all lands within the Area of Potential Effect
(APE). Accordingly, all construction is subject to state-level archeological resource regulation defined
in the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). The project was submitted to the Texas Historical Commission
(THC) in an initial coordination letter, receiving a recommendation for intensive linear archeological
survey for ACT and Section 106 compliance on November 19, 2018 (THC project 201901553). Survey
for above-ground cultural resources was recommended as not warranted. Field survey was
conducted under Antiquities Permit 8769.

CHAPTER 2: ENVIRONMENTAL AND CULTURAL SUMMARY

The project is located within the North-Central Plains physiographic region (Bureau of Economic Geology
1996), within the Blackland Prairie vegetation region as defined by Gould et al. (Gould et al. 1960). The
Blackland Prairie was historically characterized as a prairie consisting of tall grasses, productive soils,
and gentle topography; however, much of the region is currently comprised of crop land and other
agriculture uses (Texas Parks and Wildlife 2019). According to Collins, geographically the project area is
characterized as an area of low topographic relief and poor drainage that is prone to frequent flooding
(Collins 1995).

The survey corridor is in an area consisting of maintained park land, fallow pasture/fields, woodland
areas, and encroaching wetlands. There is roadway development adjacent to both the easternmost and
westernmost sections of the project area and two other high traffic roadways crossing through the center
of the project area; disturbances associated with this development are frequent throughout the project
area. Disturbances include existing facilities, terraformed park lands, fence lines, roadways crossing
Cottonwood Creek and culverts and residential construction adjacent to its tributaries.

2.1

Geology and Soils

According to the Geologic Atlas of Texas (USGS 2019), the entire project footprint overlies the Late
Cretaceous-era Ozan Formation. Recorded soils include several bands of silty clay, clay and urban land
complexes. The Trinity-Urban land complex that composes the Cottonwood Creek floodplain with
associated Lewisville silty clay, Ferris-Urban and Houston Black-Urban land complexes comprise the
clays encountered on adjacent terraces (USDA-NCSS 2019; Figure 3).

2.2

Cultural History

The project area is located within the northeastern portion of the North Central Texas archeological
region. The cultural history of the project area is generally divided into four major time periods:
Paleoindian (9000–6500 BC), Archaic (6500 BC–AD 750), Late Prehistoric (AD 700–1600), and Historic
(AD 1600–present) (Prewitt 1981). The prehistoric periods are principally defined by the presence of
diagnostic projectile points and other technologies that are intended to delineate change in socio-cultural
patterns. However, cultural change proceeded at somewhat different rates over the vast area of Texas; in
some regions, hunting and gathering cultures persisted throughout prehistory; in others, cultures with
farming and settled village life dominated. Prehistoric cultures in North Central Texas appeared to
maintain a hunter-gatherer lifestyle throughout the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods, with moderate
changes in technology.

Paleoindian (11,000–8500 BC)

The earliest undisputed time of human occupation in North America is the Paleoindian Period. In north
Texas, it is generally considered to date from about 11,000 to about 8,500 years before present (BP). The
archeological evidence suggests that during this time the earliest residents of northern Texas were highly
nomadic hunters and gatherers (Brown and Lebo 1990:16). Populations were likely small and dispersed,
and they exploited a variety of wild food resources. Stone tool technology and faunal remains suggest
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

6

Archeological Resources Survey—City of Grand Prairie Proposed Robinson Rd Waterline, Dallas County, Texas

that Paleoindian peoples relied heavily on exploitation of mega-fauna such as mammoth and bison. This
focus on big game hunting fostered a distinctive lithic technology characterized by large, leaf-shaped
fluted projectile points. Folsom and Clovis points are diagnostic of this time period. However, it has been
acknowledged through more recent studies that a generalized hunting and gathering subsistence
economy that included exploitation of medium to small animals, marine resources, and various plants
was common.

Archeological sites dating to this period are often found deeply buried near water sources. A small
number of archeological sites dating to this earliest time period are known to occur in north-central
Texas. In counties surrounding the project area, only seven archeological sites have been dated to the
Paleoindian Period (two percent of the total datable sites recorded; Biesaart et al. 1985, Collins 1995).
Over the 2,500-year span of the Paleoindian Period, this calculates to about one known site per 357 years
of occupation. Due to this scarcity, these inherently valuable archeological sites are considered to be
significant cultural resources.

Archaic (8500 BC–1250 BC)

Much of Texas prehistory resides within the Archaic Period—a long time span dominated by hunting and
gathering societies. This period is notable for changes in the style of projectile points and tools and the
introduction of grinding implements and ground-stone ornaments. This indicates a gradually increasing
population that utilized abundant plant and animal resources of environments similar to those of modern
times. The primary weapon during the Archaic was the spear-thrower or atlatl. Climate patterns wavered
during the Archaic Period but were generally warmer than in the Paleoindian Period.

Near the end of the Paleoindian Period, global climate began to change slowly, becoming gradually
warmer and dryer (Brown and Lebo 1990:16). In response, plant and animal populations also changed,
and the human populations in north Texas began to exploit a wider variety of food resources. Large game
was no longer the primary focus of subsistence. Changes in technology included a more diverse suite of
lithic tools, increased use of grinding stones and the development of basketry. Pottery is absent. This
adaptation is known as the Archaic Period and has been dated in north Texas as occurring between about
8500 BP and 1250 BP. The Archaic Period is subdivided into the Early Archaic (8500–6000 BP), the
Middle Archaic (6000–3500 BP), and the Late Archaic (3500–1250 BP). Each of these subdivisions has
characteristic types of artifacts, especially projectile points, which suggest differences in economy and
possibly regional affiliations.

Of the more than 240 datable prehistoric archeological sites recorded in surrounding counties, 54
percent date to the Archaic Period (Biesaart et al. 1985). Over the 7,250-year span of the Archaic Period,
this calculates to about one known site per 54 years of occupation, a five-fold increase over the
Paleoindian Period. Archaic Period archeological sites are thus not quite so rare as Paleoindian sites, but
their data potential can be significant, especially if they are undisturbed. Consequently, a high proportion
of Archaic Period sites are considered to be significant cultural resources.

Late Prehistoric (1250–250 BC)

During the Late Prehistoric Period (1250–250 BC), major changes in technology were adopted by the
people living in North Central Texas. The development of ceramics and the introduction of the bow and
arrow allowed for significant changes in economic strategies and shifts in social structures. Also, during
this time crops such as maize appeared in Late Prehistoric peoples’ diet (Brown and Lebo 1990:16). It is
uncertain whether this multitude of changes were locally produced or acquired through trading, but the
ramifications of such activity resulted in a more diversified economy. Settlement patterns also changed
to include larger villages with houses (Ferring and Yates 1997:6). At about 1060 BP, there is some
evidence that the climate in north Texas became somewhat drier. During the latter half of the Late
Prehistoric Period, bison spread over the plains of North Texas and became a vital resource (Brown and
Lebo 1990:16).

Of the more than 300 datable prehistoric archeological sites recorded in surrounding counties, about 44
percent date to the Late Prehistoric Period (Biesaart et al. 1985). This calculates to about one known site
per eleven years of occupation during the 1,150 years of this time period— a five-fold increase over the
preceding Archaic Period and 30-fold increase over the Paleoindian Period. This higher density of
archeological sites dating to the Late Prehistoric Period is likely due to a combination of variables,
including better preserved (and thus more likely to be discovered) sites, as well as higher levels of human
population. Consequently, Late Prehistoric Period sites are common in northern Texas. Their significance
is evaluated with respect to the degree of preservation, site type, and artifact content.

Historic (250 BC–present)

During the Historic Period (250–100 BC), contact with Europeans to the south and east intensified and
the widespread use of metal tools, firearms, and the horse dramatically altered and largely replaced
earlier economic and social adaptations. During this period or early contact, the Wichita peoples
practiced limited cultivation in northern Texas (Prikryl 1987:178). During the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries, the Comanche migrated from the northern plains into much of Texas. On the eastern margins
of this area were the Caddo peoples.

The city of Grand Prairie is located between Dallas and Fort Worth in Dallas County. Settlement around
Grand Prairie began in the middle of the nineteenth century, though the town was not organized until
1863 when A.M. Dechman purchased a 239-acre tract on land granted to the Caruths in 1850 (Maxwell
2017). Dechman donated land for the townsite and a post office was established in Deckman (now Grand
Prairie) in 1874. The town name was officially renamed Grand Prairie in 1877, even though the railroad
has referred to the town as such for a number of years (Maxwell 2017). Grand Prairie was a center of
local trade and commerce in the late nineteenth century, and the town grew with the expansion on
manufacturing and mills. The economy was significantly boosted in the 1940s with operation of a Naval
Reserve Aviation Base at Hensley Field and the North American Aviation aircraft factory (Maxwell 2017).
The economy suffered a setback after World War II, however, the town encouraged the development of
new businesses and growth has continued into the late twentieth century.

2.3

Previous Archeological Studies and Site Potential Data

Background research for this project consisted of an online records search through the THC
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas 2019) and a review of historical maps and aerial photographs. Research
focused on the identification of archeological sites, sites listed as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs),
Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks (RTHLs), sites and/or districts listed on or determined eligible for
the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), cemeteries, and previously conducted archeological
surveys within one kilometer (0.62 miles) of the project area (Figure 4).

This search identified one archaeological site, 41DL354, located about 460 meters north of the
pipeline’s western terminus (see Figure 4). This site was recorded in 1993 by the Texas
Department of Transportation (TxDOT) and consisted of prehistoric bifaces and lithic chipping
debris along with 19th-Century glass bottle fragments and other historic period domestic debris.
The site was assessed as not eligible for listing as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) nor for
listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and it was destroyed during highway
construction.

In addition, the THC Atlas plots one State of Texas Historical Marker within 1,000 m of the
project area. Marker #6728 (“Goodwin, Micajah”) is shown along S. Carrier Parkway just south
of Cottonwood Creek, but no other information is available on the Atlas. The Proposed pipeline
will not affect this location.

Finally, one cemetery is located within 1,000 meters of the project area. The Southland Memorial
Cemetery is located approximately 270 meters west of the eastern terminus (see Figure 4) but
will not be affected by the proposed pipeline.
Three previously conducted surveys occurred within a kilometer of the project footprint, but they do not
overlap with the project area.

Based on historic maps and aerial photographs identified a possible historic age structure. The structure
is visible on recent (1953 and 1968) historic aerial photographs on the south edge of the APE
approximately three-fourths of the way toward the eastern terminus (Figures 5 and 6) and was
investigated.

CHAPTER 3: FIELD METHODOLOGY

Archeologists followed the CTA’s standards for 100 percent intensive linear survey during their field
investigations for the Robinson Road Water Line Project. Thirty shovel tests (with two additional shovel
test locations marked at paved, un-testable locations) were placed approximately 75–100 meters apart
along the proposed pipeline’s 1.7-mile length, and three backhoe trenches were excavated within the
project footprint (Appendix B: Tables 1 and 2).

Shovel tests measured 30 centimeters (cm) in diameter and extended to a maximum depth of 35 cm
below the surface (cmbs). The shovel tests were excavated in 10-cm increments and all soil was screened
through a ¼-inch hardware cloth. Relevant information for all shovel tests was recorded on a
standardized form while the test locations were recorded using hand-held Global Positioning System
(GPS) units. Backhoe trenches measured approximately 90 cm wide and between 260–325 cm long. Each
was excavated in approximately 10-cm layers and extended to at least 1.5 meters deep until the
archeologists assessed sterile soil had been reached and no cultural material was present, as one
archeologist monitored excavation while another screened sediment approximately every three to four
backhoe buckets.
Site definitions outlined in the Antiquities Permit application were defined as resources containing a
certain number of cultural materials or features older than 50 years within a given area. The definition
included: (1) five or more surface artifacts within a 30-m radius, or (2) a single cultural feature, such as
a hearth or burned rock midden, observed on the surface or exposed during shovel testing, or (3) a
positive shovel test containing at least three total artifacts, or (4) two positive tests located within 20
meters of each other. However, no such resources were present within the survey corridor.

CHAPTER 4: RESULTS OF FIELD INVESTIGATIONS

The survey area consists of public park grounds (McFall’s Park), wooded marsh, wetland associated with
Cottonwood Creek and its tributaries, urban drainage systems bordering several residential blocks, a
clear-cut ROW for electric utilities, newly built commercial lots and asphalt roadways. The project’s
western terminus consists of a concrete parking lots, new office buildings, and modern debris along
bulldozed ditches and berms in the westernmost section (Figure 7 and 8). The central portion of the
project, between S. Carrier Parkway and SW 3rd Street, contains the limits of McFall’s Park, which has a
man-made canal trending East-West through part of the project area, and buried utilities, a cell tower
and extensively graded slopes of maintained park grass along the remaining project area (Figure 9 and
10). East of SW 3rd Street, the project crosses an agricultural pasture with mixed tall and short grasses
and scrub, transitioning to an area that is dominated by a narrow woodland that flanks Cottonwood Creek
and its tributaries. Cottonwood Creek and the surrounding area are regularly flooded, fostering swathes
of long marsh grasses that grow in shallow, stagnant ponds. Slightly higher elevations within this area
have created mostly by slump extending from residential blocks bordering the southern and eastern
sides of the project area, creating a thick understory of green briar, mixed grasses and poison ivy and a
sparse, secondary forest growth of juniper, cedar and white oak trees (Figure 11). East of the tree line is
an encroaching wetland area with standing water, tall grasses, and a developing wetland habitat. The
project crosses over three concrete culverts within this central portion (Figures 12 and 13). Modern
trash and household debris are very common throughout much of the project area. The project’s eastern
terminus is comprised of a residential zone adjacent to an overgrown and partially bulldozed asphalt
road which parallels a large tributary of Cottonwood Creek (Figure 14). The proposed waterline follows
the length of this old road until it descends a 40 percent slope along the deep ravine within which
Cottonwood Creek currently flows. Across the creek, the asphalt road continues, and it is probable that
there was once a bridge connecting this old road to an intersection with E. Gramley Rd (Figure 15 and
16). The project footprint has high traffic roads located at each end.

Thirty shovel tests were excavated throughout the project area (Figure 17). Soils between the project’s
western terminus and the maintained park consisted of 10-20 cm of clay, frequently containing modern
plastic or metal fragments and/or construction debris (10YR 3/2 -10YR 3/4) followed by a clay with
<1cm CaCO3 inclusions (10YR 5/4-10YR 4/3). Shovel tests within this area were terminated at 25–30 cm
due to compact, sterile clay or encountering the water table.

Ten shovel tests were excavated within McFalls Park, and many of these soil profiles showed evidence of
disturbance and the addition of grading fill to the upper terraces of the park. For example, the first 20
cm in both shovel test MH05 and Backhoe Trench 02 (BHT02), located toward the eastern end of the
park, were comprised of a 7.5YR 4/6 strong brown sandy loam with 60% pea gravel inclusions, followed
by a very dark 10YR 3/1 clay. Both have been determined to be fill layers, associated with the grading of
the park slope.
One shovel test was marked within the project area but was untestable due to concrete paving (DB05).

The soil was less disturbed east of SW 3rd Street throughout the woodland and wetland areas flanking
Cottonwood Creek and consisted of very dark gray to dark brown (10YR 3/1-10YR 3/4) clays, and the
soils were often saturated making deep, hand-excavation difficult. Shovel tests were excavated to depths
between 10 and 35 cmbs.

Three mechanical trenches were excavated within the project footprint. Backhoe trench one (BHT01)
measured 84 x 264 cm and was excavated west to east to a depth of 154 cm to ensure undisturbed soil
had been reached and no cultural material was present (Figure 18). The trench was excavated less than
10 m from the edge of a man-made canal, and excavation did not go deeper than the water table, reached
at approximately 1.5 meters below ground surface. Two zones of clay were observed in BHT01, both
inclusions of varying sizes CaCO3, deposits typical of consistently inundated soils. Zone A (10YR 3/2)
included occasional gravel and small fragments of pink plastic in the first 20 cm; Zone B had mottled,
ancient clays (10YR 4/3 mottled 40% with 10YR 5/4). The trench was taken down to sterile clay at the
water table.

BHT02 measured 93 x 302 cm and was excavated east to west to a depth of 165 cm. Trenching was
terminated after the second level of sterile clay was reached in Zone D (Figure 19). The top Zone A (020 cm) was comprised of an allochthonous, 7.5 YR 4/6 strong brown sandy loam with 60% pea gravel
inclusions, followed by Zone B (20-52 cm) which was a very dark greyish brown 10YR 3/1 clay with
gravel inclusions. Both Zones A and B have been determined to be fill layers, associated with the
terraforming of the park slope. Zones C and D are characterized by frequent CaCO3 inclusions and
smearing within the clay, and Zone D had ubiquitous CaCO3 inclusions, more so than in any other soil
profile we encountered within the project area.

BHT03 measured 87 x 324 cm and was excavated north to south to a depth of 172 cm to ensure
undisturbed soil had been reached and no cultural material was present. BHT03 was comprised mostly
of very compact, wet clay and the excavation terminated at the water table (Figure 20). BHT03 was
located approximately 5 meters east of an old asphalt road which had been partially bulldozed in the
past, and a slow-moving tributary of Cottonwood Creek flowed about 15 m east of the trench. Some
modern asphalt, concrete and gravel inclusions were observed within the first 20 cm of Zone A. Zone B
was completely sterile.

The field survey included an inspection of an area where a possible historic structure had been identified
during background research on 1953 and 1968 aerial photographs of the project area. No extant
structures or artifacts were found.

CHAPTER 5: CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Working under Antiquities Permit 8769, archeologists intensively surveyed approximately 16.3 acres of
land in Dallas County to be impacted by the proposed Robinson Road Water Line Project using a
combination of 30 shovel tests and three backhoe trenches. The project footprint was devoid of
archeological sites, features, or artifacts. Additionally, the project area has little to no research potential
since subsurface cultural materials were not encountered during the survey.

In accordance with Section 106 and the ACT, the Principal Investigator recommends that the proposed
Robinson Road Water Line Project should proceed, and there is no need for further coordination or field
investigations. In the unlikely event that potentially SAL-eligible archeological resources are
inadvertently encountered during construction, all work should cease until such time as those resources
can be investigated by a professional archaeologist and coordinated with appropriate representatives of
the THC.
Complying with stipulations of Antiquities Permit 8769, all project-generated photographs, notes, and
forms will be permanently curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin.
