Abstract

Medina Consulting, Inc. of San Antonio, Texas contracted with Tierras Antiguas Archaeology
to conduct a cultural resources survey of 5.688 acres in northeast Orange, Orange County, Texas.
The tract was proposed to be developed as a multi-residential HUD complex named Oakmont
Apartments. Because federal monies were being used to develop the property, this project fell
under the purview of a federal Section 106 undertaking. On June 15, 2009 the Texas State
Historical Preservation Officer (SHPO) advised that the tract had never been surveyed for cultural
resources, the tract was located on a landform that could potentially contain cultural resources,
and that a professional archaeologist should survey the area before any ground disturbing actions
could occur.
Although funds were provided by HUD, the development was to occur on privately owned
property and no city or other public entity was to construct infrastructure utilities through the
tract at their expense, no Texas Antiquities Permit was required. However, the(SHPO) provided
general oversight and a review of the report of investigations.
Tierras Antiguas conducted the survey on 15 August, 2009. A thorough pedestrian survey of the
surface area was conducted, and 16 shovel tests were excavated. No evidence of prehistoric
cultural material was observed either on or below the surface. An historic site consisting of a
small concrete slab and an ephemeral scatter of ca. 1940s or later artifacts were located. The site
was assigned trinomial 41OR92. The site is heavily disturbed, essentially destroyed, and
possesses little or no integrity. No artifacts were collected or curated.
As such, Tierras Antiguas Archaeology recommends to the SHPO that the development of the
tract be allowed to proceed as planned. However, Tierras Antiguas further recommends that if
any previously undiscovered cultural resources were encountered during development, work
should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds could be examined and evaluated by
Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and by the Texas Historical
Commission.

Introduction

On August 15th 2009, Tierras Antiguas
Archaeology conducted a 100%
pedestrian survey of 5.688 acres in the
City of Orange, Orange County, Texas
(Figures 1 - 3). The tract was proposed
to be developed as a HUD residential
housing complex named Oakmont
Apartments.
Because federal monies were being used
to develop the property, this project fell
under the purview of a federal Section
106 undertaking. On June 15, 2009 the
Texas State Historical Preservation
Officer (SHPO) advised that the tract
had never been surveyed for cultural
resources, the tract was located on a
landform that could potentially contain
cultural resources, and that a
professional archaeologist should survey
the area before any ground disturbing
actions could occur.

County in Texas.

Although funds were provided by HUD,
because the development was to occur
on privately owned property and no city
or other public entity was to construct
infrastructure utilities through the tract
at their expense, no Texas Antiquities
Permit was required. However, the

a review of this report of investigations.

Consulting, and the Texas SHPO. Their comments if any, were addressed and incorporated into
this Final Report.

Project Setting
Geology and Soils
The project area where the new
development is to be located is
illustrated in Figure 4. The underlying
sediments are fluvatile terrace deposits
of the Beaumont Formation, and are
mid-late Pleistocene in age (ca. 12,000
to 100,000 years old).
“The Beaumont Formation is mostly
clay, silt, and sand; includes mostly
stream channel, point bar, natural levee, Figure 4. Geologic map of the project area.
backswamp, and to a lesser extent
coastal marsh and mud-flat deposits” (Barnes 1992). Specifically, sediments and soils within the
Oakmont Apartments’ nearly 6-acre project area are classified as areas that are predominantly
clayey sand and silt (Qbs).
Overlying and imbedded within these Pleistocene sediments are Orcadia-Urban land complex
(OuA) loamy and clayey sediments laying on very gentle (0-2 percent) slopes, and pedogenically
derived from the Beaumont formation. A typical pedon of Orcadia-Urban land soils consists of
a 10-cm surface layer of dark grayish brown silt loam, and then underlain by greater than 20 cm
of dark gray clay with red, gray, yellow, and brownish gray clay mottling (Soils 2009).

Modern Physiography and Climate
The entire area of Orange County is low
in elevation, rising from sea level on its
extreme southeastern edge formed by
Sabine Lake and its confluence with the
Gulf of Mexico, to only 30 feet above sea
level on its northern boundary. It lies
within the Central Prairie physiographic
region of Texas, and more specifically is
subdivided by the Piney Woods
ecosystem with pine and hardwood
forests, amidst grasslands in its
northwestern portion, and the Gulf

data for Orange Texas, 1960 - 1990 (World
portion, where predominate patches of
Climate 2009).
bald cypress and water tupelo
swamplands surround patches of grasslands. The current Oakmont Apartment project area lies
within this latter ecosystem (Mason 1996).
Remarkedly, none of the other 253 counties in Texas receives more average annual rainfall than
does Orange County; about 56 inches (Figure 5). With this large amount of precipitation, an
annual average temperature of 680 F, and a very high daily average humidity of 89 percent, the
climate is categorized as subtropical humid (Mason 1996).

Local Modern Fauna
A very wide diversity of animals abound from the Gulf Coastal salt sea environs in the south, to
the heavily forested Piney Woods in the north. Along the southern shores, modern-day visitors and
locals enjoy watching aviaries either native to the area or seasonally migratory. Common-named
species include white pelicans, herons, egrets, wood storks, white ibis, sandhill cranes, gulls, terns,
upland plovers, the ever-popular sandpipers, dowitchers, snipes, and woodcocks. Just offshore,
pheasants, quail, turkeys, sandhill cranes, ducks, geese, woodcocks, and jacksnipes are not
uncommon (Mason 1996).
Common mammals that persist in the wooded and grassland hinterlands of Orange County include
squirrels, opossums, muskrats, beavers, otters, mink, ring-tailed cats, badgers, raccoons, skunks,
civet cats, nutrias, coyotes, foxes, deer, and bobcats. Amphibians include toads, frogs, American
alligators, turtles, and diamond-back terrapins. Reptiles include black-striped snakes, speckeled
racer snakes, Texas cat-eyed snakes, Louisiana Pine snakes, and smoothed green snakes (Mason
1996).

Cultural Context and Chronology
Paleoenvironment

Examining changes in the faunal and pollen data for Southeast Texas, Aten (1983) has argued that
from about 12,000 to 10,000 B.P. there was little variation in seasonal temperatures; the summers
were cooler and the winters were milder. Also, the sea level along the Gulf Coast in that period
was 18 meters (59 ft.) lower than today. Between 10,000 and 5000 B.P. there appears to have
been less rainfall and less fluctuations in temperature. Between 8500 and 5000 B.P. Aten notes
likely warmer temperatures resulting in a thermal optimum during that period. From 5000 B.P. to
the present the available paleoenvironmental data suggest that the climate began shifting, resulting
in what we see today in modern vegetation, and barrier islands and estuaries along the Gulf Coast
(Aten 1983).
Archaeological Record
The Oakmont Apartment project and Orange County fall within the Southeast Texas
Archaeological Region as defined by Perttula (2004). Interest in Southeast Texas archaeology began
in 1879 when Edward Palmer of Harvard University’s Peabody Museum visited sites in the region and
collected artifacts for the museum. It wasn’t until 1903 that a shell midden was investigated by an amateur
archaeologist. Then in 1919 and 1931 the University of Texas at Austin conducted surveys in the region
(Guy 1990).

Humans have lived in the Southeast Texas area for at least 11,000 years. The currently accepted
framework of prehistoric culture history for the Southeast region is outlined by Ricklis (2004).
This region identifies populations ranging from the Paleoindian period (prior to 8000 B.P.), to
Archaic foraging cultures (ca. 8000-2,000 B.P.), to the Ceramic period (2000-1300 B.P.), and to
the Late Prehistoric period (1300-ca. 500 B.P). These cultural time periods are based on changes
archaeologists perceive in the material record related to environment, technology, subsistence
practices, and/or population size of prehistoric cultures.

Paleoindian Period (ca. 11,000-8000 B.P.)
Paleoindian sites are rare and often consist of isolated finds of diagnostic artifacts such as those
that have washed up on McFaddin Beach (41JF50) over the years (Long 1977). Lanceolate
projectile points with ground, concave bases and longitudinal fluting typical of Paleoindian tool
technology recovered in this region suggest that early occupations were principally distributed
along the valleys of major stream basins (Perttula 1995) or along the Gulf Coast (Ricklis 2004).
However, beyond defining point types, archaeologists know very little about Paleoindian lifeways
in Southeast Texas because no sites with intact components have ever been systematically
investigated (Ricklis 2004). Applying more complete data from other parts of Texas,
4

archaeologists generally assume that Paleoindians in Southeast Texas practiced a nomadic hunting
and gathering lifestyle, and that this lifestyle continued well into the Archaic period, despite
changes in climate and environment (Story 1990).

Archaic Period (ca. 8000-2000 B.P.)
Changes in technology accompanied climate and environmental changes during the Archaic period
(8000 - 2000 B.P.). Following the sequence for other parts of Texas, the Archaic Period is
subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late divisions. Each of these subdivisions has characteristic
types of artifacts, especially projectile points, which suggest differences in economy, technology,
and possibly regional adaptations. A general outline of dart point chronology during this period
in Southeast Texas is available (Ricklis 2004), and many Archaic sites represented by flaked stone
dart points and other lithic tools have been found in the inland region of southeast Texas, mostly
near major streams. Neches River, Bell/Calf Creek and Trinity points represent the Early Archaic;
Bulverde, Yarborough, Travis and Palmillas represent the Middle Archaic. However, the paucity
of other evidence (i.e. faunal, botanical, etc.) allows for little generalization regarding subsistence
strategies other than the suggestion that these groups were likely engaged in some form of hunting
and gathering. In general, sites with intact Early and Middle Archaic components are rare in
Southeast Texas. On the coast, Archaic period sites of Southeast Texas consist mostly of shell
middens located along the shores of secondary bays, or in and around river mouths and deltas
(Ricklis 2004). The most complete Archaic sequence of occupation in this region was recovered
from the Eagle’s Ridge site (41CH252) in Chambers County. In this densely stratified shell
midden, a large sample of features and artifacts (comprising mostly of Rangia cuneata, but also
oyster shells) from the earliest part of the period to the latest were recovered.
The number of known Late Archaic period sites is much higher than any previous period and this
has led researchers to suggest significant population growth occurred during this time. Data from
Late Archaic sites in Southeast Texas also indicate that people were becoming more sedentary.
These data include the use of poor quality local lithic materials, which suggests that there was
reduced mobility and smaller, more localized territories. Cemeteries such as the Ernest Witte
Cemetery (41AU36) at the western edge of the Southeast Texas region, also become more
common. These cemeteries could be quite large and often contained grave goods. For example,
Group 2 of the Ernest Witte cemetery contained 145 individuals along with lithics, bone pins, shell
beads, and shell pendants (Ricklis 2004). Based on investigations at Late Archaic period sites,
archaeologists posit that indigenous people retained a hunting-gathering subsistence economy but
also developed more regionally specialized approaches toward exploiting their environment (Story
1990).

5

The Early Ceramic Period (ca. 2000-1300 B.P.)
The Archaic period generally ends with the introduction of ceramics in prehistoric sites (20001300 B.P.). During the Early Ceramic period, there is not much evidence of major changes in
lifeways. Early Ceramic period artifacts recovered overlying Archaic ones near river drainages
suggest consistent patterns in subsistence and settlement over time. The earliest ceramics include
thick walled, blocky paste ceramics with little to no temper other than natural sand inclusions.
These chunky pottery types ultimately gave way to the thinner-walled sandy paste ceramics known
as Goose Creek Plain (Aten 1983) that dominate prehistoric assemblages of Southeast Texas until
well into the Historic Period. Story (1990) coined the term ‘Mossy Grove Tradition/Culture’ to
describe groups that occupied areas in Southeast Texas during the Ceramic period. It is thought
that most Mossy Grove groups were hunters and gatherers who practiced a seasonal-round
subsistence pattern with no permanent settlement.

Late Prehistoric Period (ca. 1300-500 B.P.)
The Late Prehistoric is usually defined by the introduction of the bow and arrow. Evidence from
the Mitchell Ridge site (41GV66) suggests that the Late Prehistoric in Southeast Texas can be
divided into the Initial Late Prehistoric subperiod, represented by Scallorn arrowpoints, and the
Final Late Prehistoric period. This latter period correlates with the well-documented Toyah phase
common throughout Texas, represented by an abundance of bison bone and a lithic assemblage
geared towards processing the meat and hides of large game (Ricklis 2004). Unlike the more
sedentary Caddo Indians to the north, the Native Americans of Southeast Texas, practiced a
pattern of seasonal migration, fishing along the coast during the Spring and Summer months and
hunting deer, bison and bear inland during the Winter (Newcomb 2002).

Historic Period (ca. 500 B.P.)
Spanish and French explorers traveled through East and Southeast Texas beginning in the sixteenth
century. They encountered a number of Caddoan and Atakapan groups living along the coast and
in the piney woods to the north. It is from these reports that archaeologists and historians have
learned much of what is known about prehistoric lifeways in Southeast Texas. According to
Newcomb (2002), the area around the Oakmont Apartments project area was very sparsely
occupied. Those who lived in the area spoke one of the Atakapan languages. Unlike the Caddo
region farther inland, this area was not conducive to agriculture, due to its salt-saturated and
marshy environment. The Atakapan groups who lived in the coastal region of Southeast Texas
typically retained a hunting and gathering lifestyle well into the eighteenth century, moving
seasonally from the coast (in Summer) where they fished and gathered shellfish and oysters, to
inland areas (in Winter) where they hunted deer, bear, alligator, and occasionally bison. They
traveled inland primarily by dugout canoe along the wide, slow-moving creeks and bayous. They

6

traded dried, smoked fish to inland groups, and from the Caddos to the north received some
ceramics in exchange (Newcomb 2002).
In 1690, the Spanish began establishing a series of missions in East Texas, starting with San
Francisco de los Tejas near Nacogdoches (Weddle 2008). In 1756, in response to intelligence that
the French were building trading outposts in the region, the Presidio San Augustín de Ahumada
was built near the mouth of the Trinity. Fifty families moved from Mexico to occupy it (Newcomb
2002). The Mission Nuestra Señora de la Luz located at the former location of a French trading
post, was established in 1765 near the Trinity River delta, approximately 60 miles wset-southwest
of the Oakmont Apartments project. The Indians that were sheltered by this Presidio and Mission
were mainly inland Atakapans, such as Bidais and Deadoses. They were initially friendly to the
Spanish, but eventually aligned themselves with the French, trading with them for arms. As these
indigenous groups were increasingly exposed to Europeans, trade items such as glass beads, metal
points, buttons, and gun parts made their way into the archaeological record. Unfortunately,
contact with the Europeans also brought new diseases, which severely reduced the populations of
indigenous villages. By the early nineteenth century there were perhaps only 100 Bidais, while
other Atakapan-speaking groups had effectively ceased to exist or had become so few that they
joined Caddo groups to the north for survival (Newcomb 2002).
Though lightly populated during the historic period, the area was nonetheless well-known to many
East Texas Indians who visited the Sour Lake area to bathe in the hot mud and mineral waters in
that area. Settlers of European descent did not begin to permanently inhabit the region until the
1830s, and even then only sparsely. White settlers who came to the area migrated primarily from
the southern United States. These immigrants established small farms, and if they had the means,
most of them also owned or brought slaves to help work the farms. Though East Texas was longrecognized as a valuable resource for its thick forests of loblolly and longleaf pine, the ability to
exploit the region’s timber was limited without a means of transporting it to mills and markets
(House 1967).
Early timbering efforts involved cutting forests near major creeks and rivers, then floating them
downstream to mills located near Beaumont. Rail transportation was slow to come to this region;
the costs of opening rail lines did not justify their construction in the sparsely populated regions
of East Texas. However, once the Texas legislature began offering generous land incentives in
exchange for track-building, rail construction surged (Miller 1972). In between the increasingly
dense grid formed by the major railroads, the lumber companies built smaller tracks and spurs
leading into the pine forests. The Gulf Beaumont and Kansas City Railway (later the Gulf
Colorado and Santa Fe) was built in 1894, connecting a mill in Beaumont to Silsbee and opening
the forests north of Orange to logging (Reed 2009). Within just a few decades the seemingly
endless forests of east Texas were almost completely cut down.

Orange, and Orange County History
Orange County was formed out of part of Jefferson County in 1852. Initially, the community that
was to become the county seat for Orange County was named Green’s Bluff. It was named
7

Green’s Bluff for Reason (Resin) Green who had settled in the area by 1830, and who plied his
trade as a boatman on the Sabine River. Obviously, President James Madison had made a
significant impression on the majority of local citizens because the community was renamed
Madison in 1840. By 1850, it had a post office, and when the boundaries for Orange County were
surveyed and the land separated from Jefferson County in 1852, Madison became the county seat.
However, there was another community in the new county named Madisonville, so when Madison
was officially incorporated in 1858, the citizens once again renamed it; this time as Orange,
supposedly for an orange grove owned by local citizen George Patillo; or for a bunch of orange
groves located on the lower reaches of the Sabine River (Kleiner 1996; Mason 1996).
In a strategically political quagmire sensitively located directly on the heated and sometimes
volatile border between French Louisiana and Spanish Colonial-owned territory, Spaniard Alonso
Alvarez de Pineda visited the coastline in 1519 and named the river San Francisco de Sabenes
(Sabine). Two centuries later Frenchman Louis de St. Denis founded Natchitoches as a French
trading post in the lands occupied by the Caddoan Natchitoch Indians on the Red River in 1713.
This opened the door for French trade in Spanish-owned territory. The Spanish retaliated by
opening East Texas missions to not only recruit neophyte Christians among the Native Americans,
but also to serve as a buffer to French encroachment. Nevertheless, the Sabine River was no
impediment to the French traders. By the 1863 Treaty of Paris, the French ceded Louisiana to
Spain. However, in 1800, after Napoleon came to power, he sold the Louisiana Territory to the
United States. Border disputes between the U.S. and Spain were often heated until the AdamsOnis Treaty between the two countries effectively established the Sabine River as the official
border (Kleiner 1996; Mason 1996).
After Mexico gained its independence from Spain in 1826 and claimed jurisdition of the area west
of the Sabine, large land grants were granted to settlers. The Sabine river and lake became
navigable to steamboat traffic in 1837 when the U.S. cleared a path through the logs and snags.
Settlers came from Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee, and elsewhere. Located
at the mouth of the Sabine River, and on the Gulf of Mexico, the community of Orange benefitted
from new arrivals seeking to pass through there enroute to new lands in the mid-section of Texas.
Following the Mexican War with the United States, the territory was granted to the United States
under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848 (Kleiner 1996; Mason 1996).
Just before the Civil War, cotton was the cash crop in Orange County. In 1861, 20,000 bales of
cotton were shipped out of Orange. The Orange Grey and the Orange Light Guard fought for the
Confederacy during the Civil War. One of the more famous Civil War naval conflicts in the Gulf
of Mexico took place during the Battle of Sabine Pass on September 8, 1863. The Union states
needed cotton, and the Union Navy attempted to penetrate the Confederate-held coastline at
Sabine Pass in order to wrest control of the port and a railway from Houston into the interior of
Texas. However, the accurate and fearsome artillery fire from Fort Griffin by the Confederacy’s
Davis Guards thwarted the Union Navy’s efforts and repelled the attack (Barr 1996; Kleiner 1996;
Mason 1996).
Relatively unscathed by the Civil War, Orange was ravaged by a hurricane on September 13, 1865.
But the community and Orange County rebounded in the 1870s with the re-opening of the Texas
8

and New Orleans Railroad and opening of the Lutcher and Moore Lumber and Sawmill. Logging
and ship building in the county created many new jobs for the county’s nearly 3,000 people in
1880. The arrival of the Southern Pacific Railroad through Orange in 1881 then provided a direct
route to either San Francisco or New Orleans, and quickly established Orange as a major rail and
port center. The Orange community and county further boomed with the discoveries of major oil
wells in 1913 and 1922. The Sabine-Natches waterway was dredged from Orange through Sabine
Lake to the Gulf in 1916, allowing large ships access to the city. But the city of Orange was not
without its detractors at the time. With the shipping and oil boom in the 1920s came speakeasies,
gambling halls, and bootlegged liquor. Crime and violence became associated with such enterprises
as the Silver Slipper and Show Boat nightclubs (Kleiner 1996; Mason 1996).
As with most of the U.S., Orange County also felt the detrimental effects of the Great Depression,
and industry, manufacturing, and shipping decreased significantly. But, also like most of the U.S.,
the demand for goods during World War II brought back the Orange County economy. Besides
shipbuilding and manufacturing, the county’s economy received huge shots in the arm with the
opening of Du Pont, Allied, Spencer, Firestone, and Goodrich-Gulf chemical and petrochemical
manufacturers in the 1940s (Kleiner 1996; Mason 1996).
During the last half of the 20th century, the population and number of businesses in the City of
Orange has ebbed and flowed with the state’s oil economy. As of a decade ago the city’s
population was below 19,000. Although farming and ranching were slowly displaced by industrial
operations, the county’s farmers still produce fruit, rice, corn, oats, hay, cotton, and truck
vegetables (Kleiner 1996; Mason 1996).

Project Goals and Methods
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with limited shovel testing. The topics addressed were
site type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The theoretical framework is
structured around both prehistoric and historic patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and
social systems for the Southeast Texas region.
The goals of the project were to:
1)

locate and record cultural locations and sites in the project area using a systematic
survey methodology;

2)

quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy; and,

3)

place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.

Methods and Levels of Effort
Prefield Preparation
Before the official survey began, the Principal Investigator reviewed 19 on-site photographs of the
parcel and surrounding immediate area that were taken by Medina Consulting in June 2009. Next,
the project location and surrounding area was viewed on the Texas Archeological Site database
to determine what archaeological sites had been recorded within one mile of the parcel. Following
that, a thorough review of the literature pertaining to the area was conducted and site and survey
reports from the area were examined. Then, USGS 7.5 quadrangle maps, a soils map, and a
geological atlas sheet were consulted.
The Survey
In accordance with Texas Historical Commission (THC) and Council of Texas Archeologists
(CTA) Archaeology Survey Standards, a systematic, 100% pedestrian survey of the tract was

conducted. Surface visibility was poor because as
stated, there is an abundance rainfall and sunshine
in Orange County and at the time of the survey
dense grass limited surface visibility to only 0-10
percent across the area. However, the tract had
recently been cleared of large trees and brush, so
that numerous tree-fall cavities were exposed to
ca. 40 cm below the surface, large heavy
machinery ruts were commonly visible, and rodent
backdirt piles and crayfish chimneys were common
(Figures 6-8); all of these exposures were visually
inspected for the presence of cultural material. Figure 8. Crayfish chimneys and rodent
burrow backdirt piles were also common.
10

A total of 11 shovel tests were placed in areas that had not been heavily disturbed, with particular
attention given to the drainage ditches that coursed through the eastern and southeastern portions
of the project area. Shovel tests were dug in 10-cm levels, and all sediments were screened through
1/4-inch wire mesh. Following our designed research plan, any artifacts recovered from shovel
tests were not to be collected, but were to be placed in the upper 20 cm of the backfilled shovel
test. Shovel Test 11 was placed on 41OR92, and five additional shovel tests were excavated in the
immediate are to determine the vertical and horizontal extent of cultural material.

The only archaeological site discovered consists of a concrete slab with an ephemeral scatter of
historic artifacts (Figure 10) just north of West Bilbo Avenue. The hard, very well-made slab
measured approximately 10 feet by 12 feet. In August 2009, the area was heavily overgrown with
dense grasses after large trees had been cleared with heavy machinery. No artifacts were observed
on the surface, but surface visibility was heavily impeded by the dense grasses. Out of six shovel
tests placed around the concrete slab, only Shovel Test 11 was positive; a clear glass sherd with
no patina or hue, and a highly fired whiteware sherd with ribbed design were recovered from the
upper 10 cm.

A review of an aerial photograph
taken in 1943 shows what
appears to be a very small
probable structure at this location
(Figure 11). Aerial photographs
from 1964 and 1970 show what
appear to be two structures, one
possibly a small house and one
possibly a shed or small barn. By
1987 an aerial photograph
indicates that both structures
were gone. Orange City
Directories from 1917 and 1948
do not list West Bilbo Avenue.
Figure 10. Site map, 41OR92.
The street first appears in the
1958 City Directory and lists the street
as consisting of vacant and residential
lots. Attempts to contact nearby
neighbors with inquiries about the site
were not successful.
Nevertheless, the hard concrete with
crisp, sharp edges, clear glass, highly
fired whiteware, and aerial photographs
suggest that the site may have been
occupied as early as the 1930s, but more
than likely sometime between ca. 1940
and 1987. The lack of construction
materials or broken glass suggest that
any structures that existed on the site
were likely moved rather than bulldozed.
In sum, in its current condition the site
has little to no integrity, and is
considered as insignificant. Therefore, it
is recommended that development of the
project area be allowed to proceed with
no further investigations.

possible structure that is 41OR92 appears as a small
black dot in the lower south-central portion, along

Possible 1950s or Earlier Structures Around the Project Area
At the request of the 15 June 2009 letter from the SHPO, TAA took photographs of ‘possible’
1950s or earlier structures around the project area. They are included in Appendix A.

Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
A 100% pedestrian survey of the surface that offered up to 100% visibility of sporadic composites
of barren soil within the project area was conducted, but no evidence of neither prehistoric nor
historic occupation of significance was found. In addition, no cultural materials of significant value
were found in any of a total of 16 shovel tests excavated.
Therefore, we recommend that the project should proceed as currently designed by the project
sponsor. The project should be considered as having “no effect” on any properties considered as
eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places or inclusion in the State
Archaeological Landmarks Program. As such, the project should proceed without further
archaeological work. However, if any cultural resources are encountered during construction,
work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds are examined and evaluated by
Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and by the Texas Historical
Commission.
