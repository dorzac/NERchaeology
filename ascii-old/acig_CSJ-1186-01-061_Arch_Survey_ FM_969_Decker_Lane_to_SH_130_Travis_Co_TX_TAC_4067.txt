Archaeological Resources Survey Report for the FM 969
Improvement Project
Executive Summary
aci consulting conducted an intensive archaeological survey of the proposed Texas
Department of Transportation (TxDOT) District 14, FM 969 Improvements Project in
east-central Travis County, Texas (Figures 1 through 4). Fieldwork was done between 13
April and 18 May 2006. The project involves improving FM 969 by upgrading to a sixlane divided urban facility with turn lanes and median breaks. The project will include a
grade-separated interchange at FM 973. As a TxDOT project, the cultural resource
studies are guided by the First Amended Programmatic Agreement (PA-TU) among the
Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the Texas Department of Transportation
(TxDOT), the Texas State Historic Preservation Officer (TSHPO), and the Advisory
Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP).
The PA-TU outlines a process by which TxDOT may assist the FHWA in meeting its
federal obligations under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966
(NHPA), requiring all federal agencies to take into account the effects of their
undertakings on historic properties. Furthermore, the Antiquities Code of Texas (13 TAC
26) designated the Texas Historical Commission (THC) as the state agency overseeing
the preservation of archeological and historic resources on state property. A
Memorandum of Understanding exists between the THC and TxDOT streamlining the
compliance process, and integrating the process outlined in the PA-TU.
The Area of Potential Effect (APE) or total project limits include approximately 4.2
kilometers of FM 969 from FM 3177 (Decker Lane) to SH 130. The existing ROW of
FM 969 is 30.5 meters wide and the new ROW is 61 meters wide. Proposed Road
construction may impact all surface areas within the Area of Potential Effect (APE) and
impact to bedrock is anticipated (USDA, 1974).
A records search was conducted at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL) and the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas to locate any previously recorded
historic and prehistoric cultural resources within the project area. Survey methods
complied with THC/Council of Texas Archaeologists (CTA) survey standards for the
overall project area. A pedestrian survey of high-potential areas within the APE was
conducted to locate any archaeological or historical sites that may be adversely affected
by construction.
The upland setting of FM 969, existing roadway disturbance, and the long-term
residential and commercial disturbance of most of the corridor meant that a 100 percent
pedestrian survey of the entire 62.03 acre APE was not warranted. Approximately half of
the APE was existing ROW that did not need to be resurveyed (31 acres). The original
1

construction of the FM 969 highway would have disturbed any cultural resources within
the existing ROW, so a survey of the existing ROW was not conducted.
Within the additional proposed ROW, a single high-potential area, suitable to preserving
intact cultural resources, was identified (16.1 acres). The rest of the project area was on
sloped landforms and in highly developed areas that are not suitable for preserving intact
cultural resources (14.9 acres). Undulating to steeply sloping landforms are poorly suited
environments for the preservation of cultural resources, in good context, due to the
instability of the soils that creep and waste downslope from natural weathering processes.
Areas of residential and/or commercial development have had construction activities that
usually disturb the soils during landscaping, earth moving, foundation construction, and
utility line installation. Such disturbances make these areas unsuitable for the
preservation of cultural resources in good context. For these reasons, not all of the 62
acres of the APE required pedestrian survey and subsurface testing.
The section of Elm creek running between FM 969 and FM 973 included 16.1 acres of
alluvial deposition (Figure 4). This survey area was walked in 30 meter parallel transects.
A total of 21 shovel test pits (STP) and 10 backhoe trenches were excavated.
The most significant physiographic features near the APE are the Colorado River 1,130
meters to the southwest and the confluence of Elm Creek and Decker Creek 8.7
kilometers southeast. The FM 969 ROW crosses Elm Creek 930 meters from the eastern
terminus of the project area (Figure 4). Elm Creek at the FM 969 bridge is cut through
alluvial deposition and into the limestone bedrock. South of the FM 969 bridge however,
there are substantial alluvial deposits.

Late Pleistocene Lower Colorado River terrace deposits and Taylor Group clays border
the Holocene Trinity alluvium deposited with Elm Creek. The survey area is moderately
flat and is prone to flooding (Garner and Young 1976).
A 100 percent pedestrian survey with a total of 21 shovel tests and 10 backhoe trenches
were performed within the 16.1 acre high probability within the proposed ROW of the
FM 969 Improvements Project. No survey was warranted in the remaining 45.9 acres of
the proposed ROW. No surface finds were recorded, but one shovel test pit (STP) was
positive for cultural materials. Ceramic and metal artifacts along with fragments of
eroded concrete were located in the first shovel test adjacent to the bridge at FM 969.
Further STPs and a backhoe trench confirmed that these artifacts were in a disturbed
context. The additional shovel tests and backhoe trench showed that the artifacts were in

6

a context of mixed and undeveloped soil that is not a part of the Trinity alluvium. Soil in
the rest of the project area is entirely Trinity clay, frequently flooded. This welldeveloped clay is likely Quaternary and formed during the late Pleistocene or early
Holocene. The clay is considered flood prone. According to the Soil Survey for Travis
County, in this Trinity series, flooding occurs several times each year causing a continual
change of scouring and depositional patterns (USDA, 1974: 42). Shovel tests were also
excavated in disturbed areas to confirm the disturbance and test the depth of the soils.
Soil profiles that are naturally exposed through erosion were also examined.
Within the 16.1 high probability area, a thorough survey conforming to the revised THC
minimum standards has been completed. Only 16.1 acres were isolated as having high
probability for intact cultural resources. No significant cultural resources were found or
recorded within the APE. Results of an intensive 100 percent pedestrian survey, 21
shovel tests, and 10 backhoe trenches indicate that there is little or no potential of any
significant cultural resources existing within the survey area. Approximately 45.9 acres
of the APE of the FM 969 Improvements Project were determined to have a low
probability and were not surveyed.
Subsequently, minor changes were made to the alignment of the APE resulting in
approximately 0.4 acre of new ROW near Elm Creek and a 1.7-acre drainage easement
east of Imperial Drive (Figure 26). Matthew Senn evaluated these areas and their
potential for intact cultural resources with Allan Morton consulting. A breakdown of the
acreage considered in this report is found on Table 1.

and federal laws and regulations. The findings of the cultural resource survey and records
search are summarized and assessments and recommendations concerning cultural
resources are presented. A brief environmental background is provided. The remaining

INTRODUCTION

aci consulting conducted an intensive archaeological survey of 16.1 acres within the
proposed TxDOT District 14, FM 969 Improvements Project in east-central Travis
County, Texas (Figures 1 through 4). Fieldwork was done between 13 April and 18 May

7

2006. The project involves improving FM 969 by upgrading to a six-lane divided urban
facility with turn lanes and median breaks. The project will include a grade-separated
interchange at FM 973. (Figure 1 through 4).
In 2007, minor changes were made to the alignment of the APE resulting in
approximately 0.4 acre of new ROW near Elm Creek and a 1.7-acre drainage easement
east of Imperial Drive (Figure 1).
The APE or total project limits include approximately 4.2 kilometers of FM 969 from FM
3177 (Decker Lane) to SH 130. The existing ROW of FM 969 is 30.5 meters wide and
the new ROW is 61 meters wide. Proposed road construction may impact all surface
areas within the APE and impact to bedrock is anticipated on the upland portions of the
corridor (USDA 1974).
TxDOT and the FHWA will fund this project. TxDOT Environmental Affairs
Department (TxDOT ENV) on behalf of TxDOT, has conducted and will conduct all
THC coordination under the criteria outlined in the First Amended Programmatic
Agreement between the ACHA, the FHWA, the THC, and TxDOT. THC approved the
initial scope of work (SOW) and Permit # 4067 was issued to Allan T. Morton as
principal investigator for aci consulting. On 7 March 2007, a request was approved to
change the principle investigator to Matthew J. Senn.
Location of the Project Area
The western end of the project area is private land located at the intersection of FM 969
and FM 3177 (Decker Lane). The eastern end of the project area is approximately 4.2
kilometers east to SH 130. The existing ROW of FM 969 is 30.5 meters wide and the
new ROW is 61 meters wide. The survey area is located near the intersection of FM 969
and FM 973 on the eastern side of the City of Austin, in Travis County, Texas. The FM
969 bridge over Elm Creek is situated 400 meters west of the intersection of FM 969 and
FM 973. The creek flows in a southeasterly direction, crossing FM 973 100 meters south
of the intersection of FM 969 and FM 973.
Project Description
The project involves improving FM 969 by upgrading to a six-lane divided urban facility
with turn lanes and median breaks. The project will include a grade-separated interchange
at FM 973. This project is a TxDOT project and cultural resource studies are guided by
the First Amended Programmatic A
greement between the FHWA, TSHPO, ACHP and TxDOT.

Area of Potential Effect
The APE is the existing ROW and the proposed ROW within the limits of construction
(Figures 3 and 4). The limits of construction include approximately 4.2 kilometers of FM
969 from FM 3177 (Decker Lane) to SH 130. The existing ROW of FM 969 is 30.5
meters wide and the additional proposed ROW is 30.5 meters, for a total of 61 meters.
The corridor will be centered largely on the current ROW, but adjustments to the
alignment to allow for gentler curves mean that some variation exists. These variations
are indicated in Figure 3.
The total acreage of the APE is 65.23 acres. Additional ROW accounts for approximately
half of the total acreage (31.03 acres). The total acreage for the survey area is 16.5 acres.
Outside of the survey area, within the additional ROW, approximately 17.7 acres of the
APE was in upland settings and highly disturbed residential areas unsuitable for
preserving intact cultural resources. The existing ROW is also unsuitable, as it has been
in use as a major transportation corridor for over one hundred years, with multiple
construction and highway improvement activities taking place within the existing ROW
during that time. Proposed road construction may impact all surface areas within the
APE. Soils within the APE are relatively thin in the upland portions of the corridor and
impact to bedrock is likely. In the survey area, the alluvial deposition is extensive with an
unknown depth to bedrock (USDA 1974).
Environmental Setting
Physiography
The project area includes Blackland Prairie physiographic subdivision for most of the
corridor. It is bisected at Elm Creek by Colorado River Terraces physiographic
subdivision (Garner and Young 1976). Blackland Prairie is characterized by low rolling
terrain composed of deep, rich clayey soils. Colorado River Terraces is characterized by
uncolsolidated gravel, sand, silt, and clay.
The vegetation within the region consists of live oak (Quercus fusiformis), mesquite
(Prosopis glandulosa), Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei), agarita (Mahonia trifoliolata),
prickly pear cactus (Opuntia sp.), and medium to tall grasses. The land is used primarily
for livestock, but some agriculture takes place along the eastern edge of the region.
The most significant physiographic features near the APE are the Colorado River 1,130
meters to the southwest and the confluence of Elm Creek and Decker Creek 8.7
kilometers southeast. The FM 969 ROW crosses Elm Creek 930 meters from the eastern
terminus of the project area (Figure 4). Elm Creek at the FM 969 bridge is cut through
alluvial deposition and into the limestone bedrock. South of the FM 969 bridge however,
there are substantial alluvial deposits. Late Pleistocene Lower Colorado River terrace
deposits and Taylor Group clays border the Holocene Trinity alluvium deposited by Elm

9

Creek. The survey area is moderately flat and is prone to flooding (Garner and Young
1976).
Elevation within the APE ranges from 164 meters above Mean Sea Level (MSL) at FM
969 and Decker Lane to 142 meters above MSL at FM 969 and FM 973.
Flora and Fauna
Upland soils are thin to non-existent and support a live oak savanna. Ashe juniper, agarita
(Mahonia trifoliolata), and prickly pear cactus are common. Riparian forest consisting of
hackberry trees, elms, and oaks parallel the creek. Blairâs (1950) Balconian biotic
province encompasses the project area.
Geology and Soils
The project area includes the Upper Cretaceous Navarro Group and Marlbrook Marl
overlain by Quaternary Fluviatile terrace deposits. These Pleistocene deposits are
described as âterraces along streamsâ and consist of three or more levels which may
correspond to coastal Pleistocene units with siliceous, coarse gravel, sand, silt, and clay
along the Colorado River. Nine soil types are identified within the project area and these
are outlined in Table 2. The soil type in the survey area is Trinity Clay, frequently
flooded. The USDA soil survey soil description (USDA 1974) indicates a very well
developed soil at depth. This very old depositional record has a low potential for intact
buried archaeological sites. Limited potential exists only in the less-developed upper
strata (i.e. 0 to 28 inches).

Prehistoric Background
The property falls within the central Texas archaeological region (Collins 1995).
Prehistoric archaeological sites in central Texas represent continuous human occupation
starting around 11,500 years ago. Throughout its occupation, hunting and gathering is
believed to be the exclusive resource procurement strategy of prehistoric central Texans.
Sites have been interpreted to represent relatively short-term occupations. Deeper sites
with large amounts of cultural materials are thought to be camps that were returned to
through the years, possibly on a regular basis.
Michael B. Collins (1995) authored a synthesis of central Texas archaeology. The
prehistoric background will be based in large part on his synthesis. Collins divides the
prehistory of central Texas into three periods: (1) the Paleoindian, (2) the Archaic, and
(3) the Late Prehistoric. Each of these has further been divided into subperiods, such as
early and late. Smaller units of time referred to as âstyle intervalsâ are used to coincide
with the interval of use of a particular point style or group of point styles. These style
intervals can overlap or extend over more than one subperiod. Most, however, can be
used to subdivide the subperiods. Information pertaining to burned rock middens, if
found, will be based primarily on Blackâs (1989) research.

Historic Background
Historic exploration and settlement of the Travis County area began in the late
seventeenth century when Domingo TerÃ¡n de los RÃ­os, the first known European to visit
the area, traveled through the region during an inspection tour to east Texas. In 1730 the
Spanish moved the East Texas missions of San Francisco de los Neches, Nuestra SeÃ±ora
de la PurÃ­sima ConcepciÃ³n de los Hasinai, and San JosÃ© de los Nazonis to a temporary
location at the confluence of Barton Creek and the Colorado River (no evidence of the
missions has been found at the confluence). These missions were moved to San Antonio
in 1731.
Anglo-American influence in the area began with a series of land grants from the
Mexican government following Mexicoâs independence from Spain in 1821. In an effort
to colonize the Mexican frontier, the Mexican government issued land grants to
empresarios, or land agents, who would settle families in the newly formed colonies
(Sons of Dewitt Colony Texas 2003). In 1826, Benjamin Rush Milam received an
empresario contract from the Mexican government to settle 300 families between the
Guadalupe River and the Colorado River. Fifty-five land titles were granted to colonists
in 1835 (General Land Office 1889). Travis County eventually developed as an offshoot
of Milamâs Colonies.
In 1835 Thomas Jefferson Chambers surveyed the area that is now Austin, and by 1838,
four families lived in the community of Waterloo, which was located at the site of
present-day Austin. Waterloo was renamed Austin in honor of Stephen F. Austin and was
officially designated the state capital in 1840. Travis County was named in honor of
William Barret Travis and established the same year. The initial boundaries of Travis
County included approximately 64,400 square kilometers. However, the area was later
reduced when additional counties were created from Travis County territory.
Travis County grew significantly in the late 1840s and early 1850s. Most of the county
residents lived in small communities outside of Austin. During the 1850s, several rural
post offices were established throughout the county (Smyrl 2002).
After the U.S. Civil War, many former slaves remained in Travis County. Germans,
Swedes, and Mexicans also contributed to the diverse ethnic makeup of Travis County.
The economy in Travis County suffered considerably after the war and during the
Reconstruction period. The county began to show signs of recovery by 1880. The county
population rose from 13,153 in 1870 to 27,028 in 1880, and the 1880 census reported
1,912 farms. The amount of improved land rose from 83,200 acres in 1870 to 139,800 in
1880. Corn, cotton, wheat, and oats took up half of the improved farmland, while
livestock dominated the rest. The arrival of the Houston and Texas Central Railway, the
International and Great Northern Railroad, the Austin and Northwestern Railroad, and the
Missouri, Kansas and Texas line in the last quarter of the nineteenth century greatly
enhanced the commercial opportunities and boosted the county economy (Smyrl 2002).

12

Outlying communities like Cedar Park benefited greatly from the arrival of the railroads.
The Austin and Northwestern Railroad, which laid tracks through Cedar Park in 1882,
provided a feasible means of exporting the areaâs cut limestone and cedar fence posts.
By the early-twentieth century, cotton farming preceded the cattle industry. With the
dramatic growth in cotton farming, a shift in farm tenancy developed. Farm tenancy
increased steadily since 1890 and peaked in 1930. The tenancy rates continued to drop
during the Great Depression as many tenant farmers either moved away or turned to other
occupations. The cotton industry suffered economically during the 1920s from the effects
of soil depletion, falling prices brought on by overproduction, and the boll weevil
infestation. The Great Depression of the 1930s worsened the economic situation and
encouraged farmers who remained in the area to shift away from cotton to livestock and
alternative crops such as corn, wheat, and sorghum (Smyrl 2002).
Significant population and economic changes occurred in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.
The construction and expansion of roads throughout the undeveloped areas of Travis
County meant urban populations now had easier access to the Hill Country and vice
versa. Local development in the mid-1980s brought a growth spurt to outlying
communities like Cedar Park, Jollyville, and Volente. The consolidation of rural schools
also meant children could now attend schools outside of their rural communities. Today,
much of the area surrounding the APE is being commercially developed and subdivided
for residential lots.
Hornsby Bend was the first permanent white settlement in Travis County and existed
prior to the establishment of the City of Austin. It was named after Reuben Hornsby, who
settled with his family in 1832. To fulfill his claim of a league and a labor of land, he
found a spot on a horseshoe bend of the Colorado River where he built a cabin with slave
help and later a stockade. Hornsby came to Texas as a surveyor with Stephen F. Austin's
"Upper Colony". He served in John J. Tomlinson's Company of Texas Rangers from
1835 to 1836. He was also instrumental in securing a mail route from Bastrop in 1838,
and was one of Edwin Waller's surveyors who laid out the new city of Austin in 1839.
Hornsby, along with later settlers, built a gristmill, cotton gin, sawmill, blacksmith shop,
general store, and eventually a post office. In 1847, the community built the first school,
known as the Old Rock Schoolhouse, in Travis County. Hornsby Cemetery was the first
cemetery in Travis County and is located 760 meters southwest of the survey area.
Hornsby served as postmaster during the Republic of Texas era. Hornsby Bend had a
United States post office in 1856. It was closed during the civil war and reopened in 1886
for five years. At the time of the opening of Travis State School, 10 people were reported
to have been residing in Hornsby Bend. The population rose to 20 from the 1950s
through 1990 (Smyrl 2002).

13

According to the City of Austin: Online Exhibits from the Austin History Center, nothing
of the original settlement remains. Maps from the Austin History Center were reviewed
for their potential to provide information on structures in the vicinity of the survey area.
A map regression with sections of maps from 1889, 1896, 1898, 1917, and air photo from
1941 is in Appendix 1 (Figures 10 through 27). Most maps are unhelpful and provide no
information other than property owner. The 1896 map shows three structures within the
project area and as a result, these loci warranted focus during the archaeological survey.
The 1941 air photo shows much of the project area under plow. It also indicates much
variability in the placement of the creek as it meanders across the landform. No structures
are visible within the survey area on the air photo.
Inventory
Eligible Property Types in Surrounding Area
There are no designated State Archaeological Landmark (SAL) or National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) eligible properties in or near the project area. However, eligible
prehistoric properties in central Texas are typically sites buried with alluvium or
colluvium or both, rock shelter or cave sites, sites containing burials, and sites that
contain or may contain information that is significant in history or prehistory. Eligible
historic properties are typically sites associated with an important event, set of events, or
a person(s) that is important in our past. Eligible properties are also sites that display
characteristics of a class, style, a school of architecture, or a period of architecture. The
properties may be eligible if the sites contain or may contain significant data. The
properties must display a high degree of integrity. For historic properties, the site is
usually ineligible if buildings and structures lack sufficient structural or contextual
integrity or are no longer present.
Previously Recorded Sites and Cemeteries
A records search was conducted at TARL and the THC to locate any previously recorded
prehistoric and historical archaeological sites, cemeteries, and completed surveys. There
are no known archaeological sites within the APE. Twelve sites have been recorded
within 1,000 meters of the project area (Table 3). There are four known historic sites,
three prehistoric sites, one multi-component site and four with no available information.
There are no SAL or NRHP eligible properties within 1,000 meters of the project area.
There are no cemeteries located in the APE, but there are two cemeteries near the APE.
The Rogers Hill cemetery is located 260 meters west of FM 969 and Decker Lane. The
Hornsby cemetery is located 900 meters south of FM 969, east of Blue Bluff Road. A
track leads to Hornsby Cemetery south of FM 969 about 915 meters west of FM 973. The
cemetery is located at the end of the track, about 915 meters south of FM 969. On the
west side of the track to the cemetery, a historical marker delineates the former location
of the Hornsby Homesite. Two monuments at the cemetery were erected by the State of
Texas in 1936. Inscriptions are as follows:

14

"To John Williams and Howell Haggett. Killed by Indians in May 1836
while detailed from Captain John J. Tumlinson's Company of Rangers to
help protect the families of the Hornsby's settlement on return from the 'run
away scrape'."
"To William Atkinson, Pioneer Ranger buried near Daniel Hornsby when
both were killed by Indians 7 Jun 1845."
"Josephus Hornsby, 15 Mar 1822 - 21 Mar 1862, son of Reuben, settled
here 1832, Bastrop Ranger 1837, in Flores Fight 1839, in Battle of Plum
Creek 1840, Brushy Fight 1840, Vasquez and Woll Campaign 1842. Led

Table 3: Archaeological sites located within 1,000 meters of the project area
According to TARL records and field investigations, none of these sites have any
components that extend into the current APE.

METHODS

The upland setting of FM 969 and the long-term residential and commercial disturbance
of most of the corridor meant that a 100% pedestrian survey of the 65.23 acre APE was
not warranted. A single 16.5 acre high probability area within the APE was identified.
This location was at the crossing of Elm Creek and included the only area of alluvial
deposition within the APE. Alluvial deposition is a high probability area because of its
greater potential for containing intact cultural resources. Approximately half of the APE
was existing ROW that did not need to be resurveyed (31.03 acres). The original
construction of the FM 969 highway would have disturbed any cultural resources within
15

the existing ROW, so a survey of the existing ROW was not conducted. The rest of the
project area (17.7 acres) was on sloped landforms, narrow side slopes, rolling hills, ridges
and convex ridges and side slopes. All of these upland landforms have exceedingly thin
soils, are subject to extensive erosion. Archaeological surveys in these types of landforms
consistently show that cultural resources in this context is deflated or disturbed. Further,
it was the recommendation of Mr. John Budd, archaeologist for the Austin District Texas
Department of Transportation, that archaeological sites occurring in the upland landforms
found along FM 969 are consistently eroded and in disturbed contexts (Jon Budd,
personal communication April 2006). Additionally, these upland sections of FM 969 are
in highly developed areas that are not suitable for preserving intact cultural resources.
Areas of residential and/or commercial development have had construction activities that
usually disturb the soils during landscaping, earth moving, foundation construction, and
utility line installation. Such disturbances make these areas unsuitable for the
preservation of cultural resources in good context. For these reasons, not all of the 65.23
acres of the APE required pedestrian survey and subsurface testing. The section of Elm
creek running between FM 969 and FM 973 included 16.1 acres of alluvial deposition
(Figure 4), as well as 0.4 acres that were added in 2007 (Figure 26), for a total of 16.5
acres that had a high probability for buried cultural resources.
An intensive pedestrian survey was conducted in the original 16.1-acre high probability
area at Elm Creek to âidentify obvious or well known propertiesâ and âareas where
certain kinds of properties are likely to occurâ [36 CFR Â§ 64] (Derry et. al. 1985). These
include both historic and prehistoric-aged properties. A thorough records search was
completed in order to determine: (1) if there were any recorded sites within the project
area; and (2) the nature of the recorded sites in the general area. Based on these data, a
strategy for an intensive archaeological survey of the project area was devised. The
survey strategy included a 100 percent pedestrian survey, shovel testing, and backhoe
trenching. Extra consideration was given to areas with a higher potential for historical
sites or unmarked graves.
After changes were made to the preferred alignment in 2007, the additional 0.4 acres
added to the high probability area in the alluvial deposition of Elm Creek were evaluated
to determine if additional survey or subsurface testing would be required. The additional
acreage was contiguous with the previous APE. This area was carefully examined using
USGS 7.5 minute quadrangle maps, aerial photographs, and USDA soil maps (USDA
1974) to determine if additional pedestrian survey and subsurface testing would be
required, or if the previously conducted fieldwork would be sufficient to make a
determination of the presence/absence of significant cultural resources. The
determination was made that the area was small enough, and in a taphonomic context that
has already received thorough examination during the 2006 survey.
Sites as defined by Hester et al. (1997:42) are âany discrete bounded location where
humans lived, worked, or carried out a task - and where evidence of their behavior can be

16

recovered by the archaeologist.â Isolated artifacts would be plotted on a USGS 7.5
minute topographic map.
Pedestrian Survey
The revised minimum survey standards, as implemented by the CTA and THC, for
project areas of 200 acres or less require a transect interval no greater than 30 meters.
Parallel transects at 10-meter intervals were walked across the entire survey area. In total,
seven transects were walked. Transects 1 through 6 were walked on the west and south
side of Elm Creek and transect 7 was on the east side (Figure 4). Overall ground visibility
was fair to good in the treed area at the northwest and south portions of the survey area.
Visibility in the rest of the survey area was fair. Close transects allowed for a confident
appraisal. Transects of better visibility received additional attention. If an artifact were
found, the surrounding area would be cleared and carefully searched. Notes were taken
describing conditions, environment, and any other factors affecting the survey.
Photographs were taken of environmental settings, cultural artifacts, and features
encountered during the survey. All naturally exposed profiles were examined.
Cemeteries are normally found near abandoned residential sites. The landscape in these
areas were carefully examined for atypical features, such as unusual depressions or field
stones, and non-native or ornamental vegetation, such as crape myrtle (Lagerstroemia
indica), iris (Iris albicans), and lily (Lilium spp.), that may indicate the presence of an
unmarked cemetery or burial.
If a possible cemetery or burial site had been found, the area would be tested with surface
scrapes to demarcate inconsistencies in soil color or type (i.e., disturbed areas) or
subsurface probing to determine the density of soils (i.e., disturbed versus undisturbed).
However, probing would be minimal so as not to disturb shallow burials. If an unmarked
or unrecorded cemetery were discovered during the survey, TXDOT would be notified.
aci consulting personnel would thoroughly document the cemetery or burial through
detailed notes, photographs, and maps. Archival research would be conducted to
determine the names of the individual(s) interred there, the locations of the burials, and
the boundaries of the cemetery. If no evidence of a cemetery or burial were found during
historical archival research, further data recovery in the form of testing would be
undertaken under a separate Texas Antiquities Code permit and SOW.
Newly discovered sites would be investigated and recorded at TARL. If the surface
visibility at the sites were less than 30 percent, then a minimum of six shovel tests would
be executed to delimit site boundaries. Based on the results of the shovel tests and surface
inspection, the newly recorded sites would be evaluated for potential significance.

Subsurface Testing
Shovel Tests and Probes
The minimum survey standards for Texas, as implemented by the THC, requires 1 shovel
test every 2 acres (for locations between 11 and 100 acres), unless the geomorphology or
terrain conditions demonstrate that this number is unnecessary. The total acreage of the
survey area is 16.1 acres. One shovel test per two acres equates to eight shovel tests for
this survey area. A total of 21 shovel tests were performed with eight of those excavated
as radials to a single positive result adjacent to the Elm Creek Bridge.
Soils in the survey area are almost entirely clays that were likely formed during the
Pleistocene or earlier and predate known human occupation of the region. The clay soils
are stable to erosional and have a low probability of containing buried cultural deposits.
The clay soils were tested with a combination of shovel tests and backhoe trenches. In all
tests, a minimal A-horizon was encountered followed by extremely hard well-developed
clay. Soil profiles that are exposed by road cuts or naturally exposed through erosion
were also examined.
Shovel tests were 30 centimeters in diameter and were excavated to the bottom of
Holocene deposits, if possible. With the exception of shovel tests in transect 1, the
extremely hard clay made excavation very difficult. Positive shovel tests were dug in
levels no thicker than approximately 20 centimeters. Negative shovel tests may be dug in
levels corresponding to the natural stratigraphy. Excavated sediments were screened
through Â¼-inch hardware cloth unless high clay or water content required that the
material be troweled through or sorted by hand. Shovel test locations were mapped by
global positioning systems (GPS). Notes were taken describing the area, depth, soils,
stratigraphy, and any artifacts found. If a site were located during the pedestrian survey,
additional subsurface testing would be conducted to evaluate the depth and nature of
cultural deposits. The minimum survey standards for Texas require at least six shovel
tests to define site boundaries, unless the site has more than 30 percent surface visibility.
Backhoe Trenching
Testing of areas that may contain deeply buried sites is required by the THC minimum
standards. Backhoe trenching is a suitable means for testing these deposits for
archaeological deposits. Proposed locations of bridges or any other constructions that
may impact alluvium deeper than 1 meter would be tested with a minimum of one
backhoe trench. Shovel tests demonstrated that extensive alluvial deposits existed in the
survey area. The extreme hardness of the clay meant that testing of these deposits by
shovel was impossible and that backhoe trenching would be required. The trenches would
be approximately 4 meters to 8 meters long, 2 meters wide and would be dug to the water
table, bedrock, or the reach of the backhoe. Profiles would be examined, described, and

18

photographed. Representative profiles would also be drawn and/or photographed. There
were 10 backhoe trenches excavated.
RESULTS OF FIELD INVESTIGATIONS

The upland setting of FM 969, existing roadway disturbance, and the long-term
residential and commercial disturbance of most of the corridor meant that a 100 percent
pedestrian survey of the entire 62.03 acre APE was not warranted. Approximately half of
the APE was existing ROW that did not need to be resurveyed (31 acres). The original
construction of the FM 969 highway would have disturbed any cultural resources within
the existing ROW, so a survey of the existing ROW was not conducted.
Within the additional proposed ROW, a single high-potential area, suitable to preserving
intact cultural resources, was identified (16.1 acres). The rest of the project area was on
sloped landforms and in highly developed areas that are not suitable for preserving intact
cultural resources (14.9 acres). Undulating to steeply sloping landforms are poorly suited
environments for the preservation of cultural resources, in good context, due to the
instability of the soils that creep and waste downslope from natural weathering processes.
Areas of residential and/or commercial development have had construction activities that
usually disturb the soils during landscaping, earth moving, foundation construction, and
utility line installation. Such disturbances make these areas unsuitable for the
preservation of cultural resources in good context. For these reasons, not all of the 62
acres of the APE required pedestrian survey and subsurface testing.
No sites or anthropogenically altered soil horizons were encountered during the
pedestrian survey or in any shovel test. Flooding from Elm Creek has disturbed large
portions of the survey area, especially proximal to the bridge and areas south of the
channel. Flooding is known to occur in association with Trinity Clay several times per
year and causes a continual change of scouring and depositional patterns. Extensive
flooding is evident in the survey area based on the preponderance of scoured hollows
running east-west in the treed area in the northwest portion. Additional evidence of
extensive flooding and scouring is the artificial berm pushed into place along the length
of Elm Creek from 30 meters south of the bridge to 60 meters west of FM 973. Anecdotal
evidence from the tenant farmer indicates that in the late 1950s, the land owner (Mr.
Byers) tried to control flooding. Mr. Byers scraped the area south and west of the creek
with a bulldozer and pushed the soil into a continuous berm along the southwest bank of
the creek. The tenant farmer remarked further, âThe berm didnât work very well. Itâs
breached in the center and the property still floods regularly.â (Personal communication,
Mr. J. Meredith). The berm remains extant along the creek â standing up to 2 meters in
height.
Shovel test and backhoe trench results in the survey area were negative for any evidence
of historic or prehistoric archaeological sites. A total of 22 shovel tests and 10 backhoe

19

trenches were performed within the survey area. No artifacts or evidence of human
occupation in an undisturbed context were found in any shovel tests, backhoe trenches, or
during the surface survey of this project.
The survey area will be divided into three areas for convenience and are delineated in
Figure 4. Area A is designated as the portion west of Elm Creek. Area B is designated
south of Elm Creek. Area C is designated north of Elm Creek. The additional ROW, as
added in the 2007 realignment, is less than half an acre in size. The additional ROW is
located adjacent to Area B, south of Elm Creek, stretching between backhoe trenches
four and five (Figure 27). Each area has identical depositional environments with similar
disturbances. Shovel tests and backhoe trenches in each area will be summarized (see
Table 4 for formal shovel test results). The blue line in Figure 4 delineates the survey
area. It is based on two variables: the blue boundary to the southwest of Elm Creek
indicates the maximum extent of highway construction, and the blue boundary on the
northeast side of Elm Creek indicates the extent of Trinity clay alluvium. Between the
Trinity alluvium and the intersection are eroded and unstable soils unsuitable for the
preservation of cultural resources. Survey was not performed in areas of the APE that
have previously been disturbed by construction or that are in unstable upland contexts,
such as this.
Area Summaries - Surface Survey and Shovel Testing
Area A
Area A is the portion west of Elm Creek. It is bounded by the fence line at FM 969 on the
north, Elm Creek in the east, and the limit of alluvial deposition to the west. The
topography is generally flat at Elm Creek except for the bulldozer-pushed berm
beginning 30 meters south of the bridge. The landform slopes upward to the west and is
intersected by linear and serpentine scours resulting from flood events. Vegetation is
hardwood canopy, minimal understory with grass and leaf litter on the surface.

Table 4: Results of shovel testing near Elm Creek.
All shovel tests for the entire survey area were performed in Area A. A total of 21 shovel
tests were excavated in this field. A single positive shovel test uncovered 3 artifacts (1
ceramic plate fragment, 1 snuff bottle fragment, and a fragment of heavily eroded peagravel concrete). Table 5 lists the artifacts, their potential dates of use and level found
within the shovel test. According to historical specialists, Miller and Morton, the plate
fragment, a blue-on-white transfer ware, may date to as early as 1820 or may be modern.
(see figure 23) The bottle fragment and concrete are typical of material in use from the
turn of the century to present day (see figure 24) (References: Miller 2000 and Morton,
personal communication 2006).
Two shovel tests (radials) were performed in each of the cardinal directions to establish
the extent of this potential deposit. All radial shovel tests were negative. Revealed in
these further tests was evidence of extensive soil disturbance in the form of sandy
deposits located at the initial shovel test and extending north between 5 and 10 meters
and 30 meters east to the cut bank at Elm Creek, based on the findings within the radials.
Soil identified in these shovel tests indicate an atypical solum for this location. Instead of
the Trinity Series Alluvium, this shovel test and its radials (along with evidence of
bulldozer activity) indicates extensive mechanical disturbance. This disturbance is

21

evident for the following reasons: lack of soil development, lack of intact soils, mixing of
surface objects with deeper sand, and the presence of a bulldozer-pushed berm. The
artifacts were apparently pushed into place by the landowner while using sand to
construct a flood-control berm. Anecdotal evidence from the tenant farmer indicates that
in the late 1950âs, the land owner (Mr. Byers) tried to control flooding. Mr. Byers
scraped the area south and west of the creek with a bulldozer and pushed the soil into a
continuous berm along the southwest bank of the creek. The tenant farmer remarked
further, âThe berm didnât work very well. Itâs breached in the center and the property still
floods regularly.â (Personal communication, Mr. J. Meredith). The berm remains extant
along the creek â standing up to 2 meters in height.
A backhoe trench was excavated 5 meters north of the positive shovel test in order to
understand the depositional history of the location and to test the alluvium for buried
cultural horizons. It corroborated the findings of the shovel test and its radials. A horizon
of very dark gray clayey sand was observed from 29 to 74 cm below surface. The lack of
soil development in this horizon points to a recent origin. This layer may be the result of
the bulldozer activities described above. This overlies a light yellowish to grayish brown
coarse sand. The sand does not fit within the recorded Trinity Clay series, nor is it found
in any other profile along the creek. Below this soil lens is the massive olive gray clay
that is characteristic of the Trinity Series.

Additional fragments of the eroded concrete were on the surface in the vicinity of this
disturbed area as well as within the Elm Creek channel. Large blocks of this material

22

were found all along the creek bed. Some fragments are very large, suggesting that they
are the remnants of a bridge across Elm Creek and not a house foundation. Based on
these observations, the spread of this concrete may be the result of at least one storm
event. There is also evidence of extensive mechanical disturbance. A bulldozer-pushed
berm was observed on the south side of the creek extending from the vicinity of the
single positive shovel test to 60 meters west of FM973. This single positive shovel test
does not constitute an archaeological site as defined above by Hester et al. (1997:42).
These artifacts do not represent a âdiscrete bounded location where humans lived,
worked, or carried out a task.â Additionally, the disturbed nature of this deposit means
that no âevidence of human behavior can be recovered.â Had these artifacts been found in
an undisturbed context, they could have been considered an archaeological site or an
isolated find. Because these artifacts are not diagnostic to age AND were recovered from
a location disturbed in modern times, they should not be considered an isolated find.
A backhoe trench was excavated five meters north of the positive shovel test in order to
understand the depositional history of the location and to test the alluvium for buried
cultural horizons. It corroborated the findings of the shovel test and its radials. A horizon
of very dark gray clayey sand was observed from 29 to 74 centimeters below surface. The
lack of soil development in this horizon points to a recent origin. This layer may be the
result of the bulldozer activities described above. This overlies a light yellowish to
grayish brown coarse sand. The sand does not fit within the recorded Trinity Clay series,
nor is it found in any other profile along the creek. Below this soil lens is the massive
olive gray clay that is characteristic of the Trinity Series.

The remaining 12 shovel tests were excavated along the five pedestrian transects. Ground
visibility was fair to poor due to leaf litter. All shovel tests included a high clay content.
There was some variability in sand and gravel lenses. In all cases, the extremely hard clay
made shovel testing difficult if not impossible. A representative soil profile is shown in
Figure 6. All additional shovel tests in Area A were negative, the pedestrian survey found
no artifacts or features on the surface, and no sites were recorded.

Area B is located southwest of the creek and south of Area A (Figure 4). Most of the

FM 969 to 60 meters west of FM 973. The bermâs
height varies between one and one half and two
meters. Ground surface of the scraped area was very
flat and grass-covered with sparse mesquite trees. No
shovel tests were excavated in Area B because of the
extreme hardness of the clay. Five backhoe trenches
were excavated in Area B. Profiles were examined,
described, and photographed. Results of all backhoe

Area C is located on the northeast side of Elm Creek (Figure 4). The ground surface in
Area C is generally flat and slopes gently to the north. The section of Area C closest to

into Elm Creek. On the 1896 Texas topographic map (Austin Quadrangle) (Figure 7), a
single structure is evident adjacent to the highway and the bridge over Elm Creek.
Special attention was paid to this area, but no structural remains or artifacts were
identified. It may have been removed during construction of the highway because its
placement seems to be within the soil deposited as part of the road bed. No shovel tests
were excavated in Area C because of the extreme hardness of the clay. Five backhoe
trenches were excavated in Area C. Profiles were examined, described, and
photographed. Results of all backhoe trenches in Area C were identical; therefore, a
representative profile is shown in Figure 9. Differences were noted between the trenches
on the west and east side of the creek. These differences appear to be related to the
extensive bulldozer scraping and subsequent flooding on the west side. The Profiles from
the east side of the creek indicate a developed A horizon, but identical C horizons were
evident. All backhoe trenches in Area C were negative, the pedestrian survey found no
artifacts or features on the surface, and no sites were recorded.

Additional ROW
The additional ROW is a narrow sliver approximately 133 meters long, 20 meters wide,
located adjacent to the original high probability area, south of Elm Creek, stretching
between backhoe trenches four and five. Examination of the soil profiles in trenches one
through six indicated that the upper soil horizons, where cultural materials are likely to be
found, were disturbed by scouring of the surface associated with frequent flooding and
bulldozing of the area during berm construction. The additional ROW is located entirely
within the disturbed soil horizon found between backhoe trenches four and five (Figure
27). The only cultural materials found during the course of the 2006 survey were isolated
artifacts found in a disturbed context, likely associated with a storm event or bulldozing.
The remaining four portions of additional ROW (totaling approximately 1.1 acres) are
located along the western half of the current FM 969 alignment, in deflated upland
contexts, not suitable to preserving intact cultural resources, as described in the 2006
report; therefore, they were not surveyed. The 1.7-acre drainage easement located on the
north side of FM 969, east of Imperial Drive, was not surveyed because the current
construction project, as proposed, is not anticipated to impact surface or subsurface
cultural resources that may exist in this area.

27

CONCLUSIONS

Within the high probability area of Elm Creek between FM 969 and FM 973, a thorough
survey conforming to the revised THC minimum standards has been completed. No
artifacts, features, or sites in undisturbed contexts, were found or recorded within the 16.5
acre survey area. Results of an intensive 100 percent pedestrian survey, shovel testing,
and backhoe trenching indicate that there is little or no potential of any significant
cultural resources existing within the APE of the FM 969 Improvements project. There
were no cultural resources that could be deemed eligible for inclusion in the NRHP (36
CFR 60) or for designation as a SAL (13 TAC 26).
RECOMMENDATIONS

It is aci consultingâs recommendation that no further work is warranted and that this
undertaking will have no adverse effect on historic properties (36 CFR 800). No survey is
warranted in areas that have a low probability of preserving cultural resources in good
context. Approximately 31.03 acres of the APE are in the existing ROW of FM 969,
which has been significantly disturbed by previous highway construction, and
approximately 17.7 acres of additional proposed ROW are in upland and disturbed
contexts. The existing ROW is unsuitable for preserving cultural resources in good
context, as it has been in use as a major transportation corridor for over one hundred
years, with multiple construction and highway improvement activities taking place within
the existing ROW during that time .These activities would have thoroughly disturbed any
intact cultural resources that may have once been present in the 31.03 acres of existing
ROW. Outside of the survey area, within the additional ROW, approximately 17.7 acres
of the APE was in upland settings and highly disturbed residential areas unsuitable for
preserving intact cultural resources. Undulating to steeply sloping upland landforms are
poorly suited environments for the preservation of cultural resources in good context due
to the instability of the soils that creep and waste downslope from natural weathering
processes. A total of 48.73 acres of existing and additional ROW do not warrant survey,
for these reasons.
No further testing of the 16.1-acre high probability area is required. The 0.4 acre of
additional ROW that has been added to the preferred alignment since the 2006 survey is
within the disturbed portion of Area B, south of Elm Creek. Previous backhoe trenching,
conducted adjacent to and on either side of the 0.4-acre area and the pedestrian survey
confirmed that this area has little or no potential for preserving significant cultural
resources; therefore, no additional survey will be necessary. No survey was warranted in
areas that had a low probability of preserving cultural resources in good context. No
impacts to cultural resources are anticipated in the 1.7-acre drainage easement east of
Imperial Drive.
If any cultural remains are encountered during construction, all work should cease, and
an aci consulting professional archaeologist should be called to assess the site. If the site

28

is assessed to be significant, further consultation with TxDOT and the THC should be
pursued.

APPENDIX 2: ABSTRACT

Abstract
aci consulting conducted an intensive archaeological survey of the proposed Texas
Department of Transportation District 14, FM 969 Improvements Project in east-central
Travis County, Texas. Fieldwork was done between 13 April and 18 May 2006. The
project involves improving FM 969 by upgrading to a six-lane divided urban facility with
turn lanes and median breaks. Within the additional proposed ROW, a single highpotential area, suitable to preserving intact cultural resources, was identified (16.1 acres).
A 100 percent pedestrian survey with a total of 21 shovel tests and 10 backhoe trenches
were performed within the 16.1 acre high probability within the proposed ROW of the
FM 969 Improvements Project. No survey was warranted in the remaining 45.9 acres of
the proposed ROW. No surface finds were recorded, but one shovel test pit (STP) was
positive for cultural materials. Ceramic and metal artifacts along with fragments of
eroded concrete were located in the first shovel test adjacent to the bridge at FM 969.
Further STPs and a backhoe trench confirmed that these artifacts were in a disturbed
context. Subsequently, minor changes were made to the alignment of the APE resulting
in approximately 0.4 acre of new ROW near Elm Creek and a 1.7-acre drainage easement
east of Imperial Drive. Matthew Senn evaluated these areas and their potential for intact
cultural resources with Allan Morton consulting. Based on the data summarized in this
report, aci consulting recommends that no further work is warranted.
