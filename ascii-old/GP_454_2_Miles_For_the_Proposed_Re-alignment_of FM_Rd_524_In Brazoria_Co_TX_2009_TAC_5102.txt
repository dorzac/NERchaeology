ABSTRACT
HRA Gray & Pape, LLC, of Houston, Texas, performed a reconnaissance and intensive
pedestrian cultural resources survey on a total of 3.3 kilometers (2 miles) of proposed roadway
re-alignment for Farm-to-Market Road 524 in Brazoria County, Texas. The lead agency is the
Texas Department of Transportation. At the time of survey, approximately 95% of the property
was owned by ConocoPhillips and the Chevron Chemical Company. However, plans are for this
land to eventually be given to the Texas Department of Transportation. Therefore, a Texas
Antiquities Permit was requested and received for this project (#5102).
Fieldwork was conducted in June and August of 2008 and February of 2009, and required 65
person hours to complete. All fieldwork and reporting activities were completed with reference
to Texas minimum survey standards as approved by the Council of Texas Archaeologists and
the Texas Historical Commission.
The Area of Potential Effect for this project includes all land to be subsumed by the construction
and re-alignment of a roadway. This survey area was approximately 3.3 kilometers (2 miles)
long. The survey corridor was 42.7 meters (140 feet) wide, yielding an area of 15.0 hectares
(37.2 acres) of both existing and proposed new right-of-way. The approximate depth of impact
will be 0.92 meters (3 feet). Approximately 11.5 hectares (28.5 acres) of the project is located
outside of existing right-of-way on privately owned land.
The Potential Archaeological Liability Map developed for the Texas Department of
Transportation displays the project area as containing areas with both a high and low
probability for intact buried cultural materials. These are represented by Units 1 and 3,
respectively. In Map Unit 1, only surface survey is recommended and deep testing is only
necessary in areas of deep impacts. In Map Unit 3, no surface survey is recommended and
deep testing is only necessary in areas were there are deep impacts. A total of 56 tests were
excavated in undisturbed areas of the Area of Potential Effect, all of which were within
proposed new right-of-way. These entailed 33 shovel tests, 7 auger tests, and 18 shovel tests
with supplemental auguring in an attempt to reach deeply buried cultural deposits. Tests were
conducted within all liability map unit areas with the highest concentration taking place
within Unit 1 locations.
No new or previously identified archaeological sites were recorded during the investigation.
Testing results displayed soil profiles indicative of those that are mapped for the area and
gave no indication of buried cultural horizons within the proposed depth of the Area of
Potential Effect. Based on the negative results of the intensive pedestrian survey, HRA Gray
& Pape, LLC recommends no further work and that the project be allowed to proceed as
planned.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
On behalf of Berg Oliver and Associates, HRA Gray & Pape, LLC (HRA Gray & Pape)
conducted an archaeological assessment on property associated with the proposed re­
alignment of Farm-to-Market (FM) Road 524 for the Texas Department of Transportation
(TxDOT), Houston District (Project CSJ Number 1004-01-040) in Brazoria County, Texas.
The Lead Agency for this project is TxDOT; the Texas Antiquities Permit (TAP) Number is
5120.
This cultural resources survey is part of an Environmental Assessment that will evaluate the
environmental impacts of the issuance of this permit and is to be undertaken with the
assistance of federal funding. As a result of federal involvement with the project, this cultural
resources survey is required to comply with federal laws requiring agencies to take into
consideration the effects of the undertaking on cultural properties. Procedures for complying
with these federal regulations are given in Procedures for the Protection of Historic and
Cultural Properties (36 CFR 800) and National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) (36 CFR
60) (United States Department of the Interior [USDI] 1983).
The steps that a federal agency must take to insure proper review of any undertaking funded
or permitted by that agency and to comply with the requirements of Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) are elucidated by 36 CFR 800. According to 36
CFR 800, all National Register and National Register-eligible properties that may be
impacted must be identified. The Criteria of Effect (36 CFR 800.3[a]) must then be applied
in consultation with the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) to determine whether the
undertaking will have an effect on any NRHP-eligible properties. The Criteria of Adverse
Effect (36 CFR 800.3 [b]) is then to be applied to any effected properties to determine the
nature of the effect. If no adverse effect will result from the undertaking, the Advisory
Council on Historic Preservation must be furnished with documentation of this finding. If the
undertaking will have an adverse effect, the agency must consult with the Advisory Council
on Historic Preservation and SHPO to consider alternatives that could avoid, mitigate, or
minimize the adverse effects.
This archaeological investigation was conducted in order to determine if the initiation of this
project would affect any cultural properties as defined by Section 106 of the NHPA of 1966,
as amended (36 CFR 800), or historic properties with the potential for listing on the NRHP
(36 CFR 60), located within the project’s Area of Potential Effect (APE). All fieldwork and
reporting activities were completed with reference to state (13 TAC 26), and federal (36CFR
800; 36 CFR 60) guidelines.

1.1 Project Description
The project consists of the proposed re-alignment of an existing portion of FM 524 located in
Brazoria County. The project area is located on the Sweeny United States Geological Survey
(USGS) 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle map in Brazoria County, Texas (see Figure 1).

The project area is located near the town of Old Ocean. The project area extends from the
junction of the current alignment of FM 524 with County Road (CR) 359 (Damon Black
Ferry Road), follows, then parallels a portion of CR 359 to the northeast, and then swings
north-northwest until reaching State Highway (SH) 35. Vegetation in the area consists of
mixed hardwoods and grassy pasture land with surface visibility less than 10%. The nearest
water source to the project is an unnamed creek that runs through the southwestern portion of
the project APE (Figure 1). There are however, two to three remnant oxbow lakes adjacent to
the project area. Topographic maps and aerial imagery show these abandoned creek channels
as being shallow and/or partially or fully filled in. Otherwise topography associated with the
project is featureless and level.
As currently planned the project will entail 3.3 kilometers (2 miles) of two 3.7-meter (12foot) lanes with 2.4-meter (8-foot) shoulders. Additional components include roadside
drainage ditches and a 2.1-kilometer (1.3-mile) long outfall ditch with a width that varies
from 14.6 to 20.4 meters (48 to 67 feet) wide and an estimated depth of approximately 0.92
meters (3 feet) (see Appendix A for project schematics). This outfall ditch would continue
along the proposed re-alignment from an existing ditch along CR 359 and terminate at the
Salt Water Canal. The total APE measures 42.7 meters (140 feet) in width, entailing an area
of approximately 15.0 hectares (37.2 acres) of right-of-way (ROW), of which approximately
11.5 hectares (28.5 acres) is new and will be located on private land.

2.0 RESEARCH DESIGN
2.1 Site File and Literature Review Research Strategy
Site file research was initiated by reviewing records maintained by the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas, and by consulting on-line research archives
maintained by the Texas Historical Commission (THC). Research was conducted within a
1.6-kilometer (1 mile) study radius of the project area to identify all previously recorded
archaeological sites, historical markers, and historic structures eligible for NRHP listing. Site
file research was used to provide a historic context to the archaeological survey. There are no
previously recorded archeological sites within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the project area.

2.2 Field Methods
The archaeological investigations associated with the current undertaking were designed to
identify and record the existence of cultural resources within the defined project boundaries.
The APE was subjected to intensive pedestrian cultural resources survey. Archaeological
investigations included a combination of pedestrian walkover and systematic and judgmental
testing.
Prior to initiating the field survey topographic quadrangle maps, recent aerial imagery, and
soils data were closely examined and information about previously recorded sites in the
general area was collected in an effort to determine which areas along the proposed road realignment were most likely to contain archaeological sites. Using this information, the route
was divided into areas of low and high probability for containing buried, intact
archaeological sites. This was essentially based on the project setting as well as TxDOT’s
own PALM (Appendix B). A discussion of the PALM system and how it guided survey
efforts is described in the following chapter.
Per THC guidelines, minimum standards for surface reconnaissance and subsurface testing
on linear projects call for 16 shovel tests per 1.6 kilometers (1 mile), within a 30-meter (100foot) wide corridor or two shovel tests per acre for projects between 4.45 and 40.47 hectares
(11 and 100 acres) in size. Our survey strategy used THC standards as a guide, while
focusing survey efforts on sections of the road re-alignment that contained the highest
potential for discovering buried resources.
The field strategy entailed surveying areas considered to have a low probability at a less
intensive shovel test interval, thereby allowing the survey crew to concentrate their efforts on
high probability areas most likely to contain intact, significant buried resources. Thus,
sections of the re-alignment were investigated at a closer interval than others. These areas
were generally located within 100 to 200 meters (300 to 600 feet) from existing or remnant
waterways or exhibited high potential landforms or soils. Likewise, certain areas were
surveyed at a less intensive shovel test interval if evidence of prior disturbance, the presence
of saturated or ancient low probability soils, excessive slope, or other factors were noted.
4

Close-interval testing consisted of tests located 30 to 60 meters (100 to 200 feet) apart. At
larger intervals testing was typically placed at a distance of every 100 meters (300 feet) per
Texas state minimum standards. For the current project, the use of judgmental testing was
used instead of the minimum 100-meter (300-foot) standard for low probability testing.
Judgmental tests were excavated at unsystematic intervals or locations for the purpose of
confirming the low probability status of an area within the APE or to explore locations that
may not follow the cultural probability model for the area.
The intensive pedestrian survey included the systematic placement of shovel tests along one
to two transects within the survey corridor. All shovel tests measured 30 x 30 centimeters (12
x 12 inches) in diameter. Vertical control of each shovel tests was maintained by excavating
in arbitrary 10-centimeter (4-inch) levels. One wall of each shovel test was profiled and the
walls and floor of each shovel test were inspected for color or texture change potentially
associated with the presence of cultural features. Descriptions of soil texture and color
followed standard terminology and soil color charts (Munsell 2000). Additional information
concerning soils encountered was recorded on standardized forms for each excavation.
Whenever possible, shovel tests were excavated into sterile subsoil, and soils were screened
through 0.64-centimeter (0.25-inch) wire mesh; soils with high clay content were hand
sorted.
In several instances, a manually operated bucket-auger was used to supplement or take the
place of a shovel test in an effort to collect deeper test samples. The bucket-auger is capable
of obtaining 20-centimeter (8-inch) long samples that measure approximately 10-centimeters
(4 inches) in diameter to a maximum depth of 3 meters (9.9 feet) below the ground surface.
This method of deep testing allowed the field survey crew to obtain additional information
beyond the data resulting from shovel testing to determine the likelihood of the proposed
project’s effect on unknown deeply buried sites. Excavated auger tests measured 7.6
centimeters (3 inches) in diameter and were typically excavated to a maximum depth of 1
meter (39.4 inches) into the underlying substratum, or until culturally sterile subsoil was
encountered.
If buried resources were located, an attempt was made to define their boundaries. Additional
delineation shovel tests were excavated in four radiating directions in intervals between 10
and 30 meters (33 and 100 feet) within the confines of the survey corridor. In general, two
sterile shovel tests were used to define a site’s size and location. At a minimum, between six
and eight delineation shovel tests were excavated unless surrounding landforms or
topography suggested the presence of a natural site boundary.

2.3 Site Definition
Cultural resources, if located, were to be defined according to THC standards (as referenced
in 13 TAC 26.20). However, no sites were located during survey and thus a discussion of
site definition is not included within this report.

3.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
There are two factors that affect the possibility of habitation within a certain area. These
include the geologic setting and soils in the area. A brief description of each of these topics
as they relate to the survey area is provided below.

3.1 TxDOT PALM
The Texas Department of Transportation’s PALM (Abbott 2001) covers Brazoria County
and other counties in the greater Houston area. These maps are based on a combination of
data, including soil associates, landform types, cultural and natural resource distribution, and
historic and modern land use data. The PALM is a cultural resource management tool that
predicts the likelihood of detecting intact prehistoric cultural resources in various
topographic settings around Houston. The model also recommends the type of archaeological
survey strategy that should be implemented for a given PALM unit.
Portions of the project are located in PALM Units 1 and 3. In PALM Unit 1, surface survey
is recommended and deep testing is necessary in areas of deep impacts. The current project is
classified as being PALM Unit 1 in the southern half of the project area (approximately 1.6
kilometers [1 mile]) and PALM Unit 3 for the remainder. For areas designated as PALM
Unit 1, tests were placed at 30-meter (100-foot) intervals. Many of these tests were also
staggered in order to cover the entire survey corridor. For PALM Unit 3, no surface survey is
recommended and deep testing is only necessary in areas were there are deep impacts. This
area was subjected to pedestrian survey with judgmental shovel testing in order to confirm
that low probability soils were present.

3.2 Project Area Geomorphology
The Texas Coastal Plain is part of the larger Gulf Coastal Plain. The coastal plain is
characterized by a low topographic relief and extends from Florida to Mexico. The Texas
Coastal Plain reaches as far north as the Ouachita uplift in Oklahoma, and as far west as the
Balcones escarpment in central Texas. The basic geomorphological characteristics of the
Texas coast and associated inland areas, which includes Brazoria County, resulted from
depositional conditions influenced by the combined action of sea level changes from glacial
advance in the northern portions of the continent, and subsequent downcutting and variations
in the sediment load capacity of the region’s rivers. Brazoria County is underlain by
relatively recent sedimentary rocks and unconsolidated sediments ranging in age from the
Miocene to Holocene (Abbott 2001; Van Siclen 1991).
Although older geologic units have been identified in the region (see Abbott 2001; Barnes
1992; Van Siclen 1991), units relevant to the study of long-term human occupation within
the project area include the Beaumont formation. The Beaumont formation is composed of
mostly clay, sand, and silt. Abbott states that based on the age of these deposits, it is unlikely

6

that there would be deposits “dating from demonstrated, culturally relevant periods”
(2001:141).

3.3 Soils
The project area contains soils consisting primarily of Asa silty clay loam (3), Lake Charles
clay, 0 to 1% slopes (24), Norwood silt loam, 1 to 5% slopes (34), and Pledger clay (36). All
of these soils, their slope, topographic position, and their potential for archaeological
resources are listed in Table 1 (using Abbott 2001: 21-23).

Asa series soils are very deep and well drained. They are typically found on flood plains,
river valleys, and coastal plains. This soil is formed mainly from Permian-aged loamy
alluvium and is characterized as having a combined A horizon of black (5YR 2.5/1) silty clay
loam from 0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches) deep followed by a layer of black (10YR 2/1)
silty clay loam from 15 to 35.5 centimeters (6 to 14 inches) deep. Beyond those layers are
Bw and Bk layers of brown (7.5YR 4/4) silty clay loam to a depth of 96.5 centimeters (38
inches). These are followed by alternating B’w layers of brown (7.5YR 4/4) and reddish
brown (5YR 4/3) layers of silt loam and layers of reddish brown (5YR 4/4) silty clay loam to
a depth of 203 centimeters (80 inches) (United States Department of Agriculture, Natural
Resources Conservation Service [USDA, NRCS] 2007, 2003). This soil has a high potential
for containing cultural materials due to the recent age of the soils, their ability to drain water,
and their location near water, where human activity is likely (Abbott 2001).
Lake Charles clay, 0 to 1% slopes is a very deep and well drained soil found on flats and
coastal plains formed from Late Pleistocene-aged clayey fluviomarine sediments. The
combined thickness of the A horizons is 20 to 52 centimeters (8 to 20 inches) in thickness
and is typically very dark gray (10YR 3/1) clay. This is underlain by three Bss horizons that
range in thickness from 40 centimeters (15-inches) of thick very dark gray (10YR 3/1) to
light gray (2.5Y 6/1) clay with fine to medium angular blocky structure with few ironmanganese concretions, many pressure faces, common slickensides, and some calcium
carbonate concretions. The lower Bss horizons commonly have some strong brown (7.5YR
5/6) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) mottles. The C horizon is generally 26 centimeters (10
inches) in thickness and is composed of massive, very hard yellowish red (5YR 4/6) clay
with calcium carbonate concretions (USDA, NRCS 2007, 1997a). This soil has a low

7

potential for containing cultural materials due to its foundation from ancient parent material
(Abbott 2001).
Norwood series soils are very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils developed
from reddish calcareous in loamy alluvial sediments of mixed origin. They typically exhibit
Ap-Bw-Bk-BC zonation. The Ap horizon is generally 0 to 51 centimeters (0 to 20 inches)
thick and composed of light brown (7.5YR 6/4) loam in its upper portion and brown (7.5YR
4/2) loam in its lower portion. The Bw-horizon is 10 to 66 centimeters (4 to 26 inches) thick
yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam. The Bk horizon, where present, is typically up to 51
centimeters (20 inches) thick reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) silt loam. There can be three BC
horizons including BC1 which is a 15 centimeter (6 inch) thick reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6)
silt loam, BC2, a 10 centimeter (4 inch) thick light brown (7.5YR 6/4) silt loam, and BC3 a
13 centimeter (5 inch) thick brown (7.5YR 5/4) silty clay loam (USDA,NRCS 2007, 2000).
This soil has a high potential for containing cultural materials due to the potential for a buried
paleosol located well below 1 meter (3.2 feet) in depth. This is due to the recent loamy parent
material of recent age that the soil developed from (Abbott 2001). This paleosol is
identifiable by the yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very fine sandy loam it is described as
containing (USDA, NRCS 2007, 2000).
Pledger series soils are generally very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable
soils found on nearly level flood plains. These soils formed from Quaternary-aged
calcareous, reddish stratified clayey, and silty alluvium in floodplain positions lower on the
floodplain than Asa and Norwood soils. The combined thickness of the A horizons is 30 to
76 centimeters (12 to 30 inches) in thickness and is typically black (10YR 2/1) clay
exhibiting moderate fine granular and fine subangular blocky structure. This is underlain by
two Bss horizons: Bss1, typically a 25-centimeter (10-inch) thick black (10YR 2/1) clay
similar in structure to the A-horizon but exhibiting common prominent slickensides and
many pressure faces; and the Bss2, an approximately 50-centimeter (20-inch) thick dark
reddish brown (5YR 3/3) clay that also can contain a few pitted concretions of calcium
carbonate. A clear wavy boundary separates the Bss2 from the underlying BCss-horizon,
which is approximately 76 centimeters (30 inches) thick. This stratum is composed of reddish
brown (5YR 4/3) clay with weak coarse prismatic structure. Thin discontinuous strata of silt
loam and silty clay and fine calcium carbonate concretions are also present in this stratum
(USDA, NRCS 2007, 1997b).
These soils have a moderate to high potential for containing cultural materials due to a buried
dark-colored paleosol Ab-horizon which may occur well below depths of 1 meter (3.2 feet)
(USDA, NRCS 2007, 1997b). Also the soil results from a parent material of recent age
(Abbott 2001).
The soils in the project area that have a high potential for buried cultural deposits are
associated with the former creek channel(s), now in the form of ox-bow lakes, that crossed
the project area. These silty soils once lay adjacent to a strong flowing waterway that has
since been diverted, channelized, or otherwise has been reduced in its water carrying

8

capacity. The result is a landscape that once may have been highly appealing to prehistoric
people. It is these areas that are entailed within PALM Unit 1 for the current project.

3.4 Likelihood of Intact Deposits
Despite the high potential nature of the soils themselves, the impacts that have occurred in
the proposed APE reduce the potential for locating intact cultural deposits within the
proposed project depth of impact. The proposed project area lies adjacent to oil refineries and
hazardous waste disposal areas, and has potentially been subjected to activities such as the
clearing of vegetation, leveling, grating, or other earth moving activities in the past. The
project also overlaps an existing road and associated drainage ditch for approximately half of
its length.

4.0 CULTURAL OVERVIEW OF THE STUDY AREA
The southeast Texas region is divided into inland and coastal margin subregions, which have
archaeologically distinctive subsistence patterns, settlement patterns, and artifact types.
Archaeological and historic evidence suggests that some groups exploited inland resources
year round, while other groups spent parts of the year both inland and on the coast.
Based on aspects of material culture, researchers have identified six archaeological time
periods associated with Native Americans in southeast Texas; in general, these include the
Paleo-Indian, Archaic (with Early, Middle, and Late subdivisions), Ceramic, Late Prehistoric,
Protohistoric, and Historic Indian. Archaeologists within the region agree on the general
framework of cultural time periods, while disagreeing on the temporal boundaries of these
periods. Despite these differences, the chronologies developed by researchers are based
primarily on changes in projectile point technologies within the region and the introduction
of pottery. It is generally recognized that a broad-based hunting and gathering lifestyle was
used throughout all time periods.

4.1 Paleo-Indian Period
Evidence is sparse for Paleo-Indian habitation. Much of what is known about the period in
the area comes from a compilation of materials gathered from around the state of Texas and
across North America. At the close of the Pleistocene, large game hunters crossed the
Bearing Strait, and within a few millennia had penetrated into South America (Culberson
1993; Newcomb 1961). The Paleo-Indian people traveled in small bands (Culberson 1993)
and were mega-fauna hunter-gathers with the bulk of their meat protein derived from
mammoths, mastodons, giant bison, and giant sloths.
With the retreat of the glaciers (the Hypsithermal period), the mega-fauna, upon which the
Paleo-Indian peoples depended, gradually became extinct. This shift in food supply is seen as
the pivotal transition point between the Paleo and Archaic periods (Culberson 1993; Biesaart
et al. 1985; Newcomb 1961).

4.2 Archaic Period
Culberson (1993) places the beginning of the Early Archaic at 8000 B.C. Aten (1984) states
that the transition from Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric-Woodland began around A.D. 100.
There are three progressive stages recognizable during the Archaic period: Early, Middle,
and Late.
Currently, research indicates that Early Archaic peoples were small, isolated bands of huntergatherers that remained in relatively restricted regions (Aten 1984). With the loss of the
mega-fauna as a food source, the Early Archaic peoples adopted the hunting of smaller game
such as bison and deer and increased their reliance on foraging (Culberson 1993).

10

The Middle Archaic period saw the largest growth in technology and in the number of stone
tools used. Specialized tools appeared for the milling of wild plant foodstuffs (Culberson
1993) along with a large assortment of tools for food preparation and procurement.
The Late Archaic period saw a dramatic increase in the population densities of Native
American groups. Human habitation of areas rich in diverse flora and fauna intensified, as
did the variety of materials and artifacts (Culberson 1993; Aten 1984). Late Archaic peoples
began relying heavily on foraging tubers, berries, and nuts and hunting small game such as
deer, rabbits, raccoons, as well as fish and shellfish, and birds. Groups became socially more
complex than earlier periods and the result was an increasing intercommunication with
neighboring groups.

4.3 Transitional to Late Prehistoric Periods
The transitional period between Late Archaic and Woodland-Late Prehistoric is a period
marked by an intensification of group dynamics across Texas. Turner and Hester (1993) see
the first signs of village sites in the lower Pecos valley as well as the preliminary stages of
Caddo development in the east. The advent of the bow and arrow is believed by most (Aten
1984; Culberson 1993; Newcomb 1961; Turner and Hester 1993) to be from this period,
though some place it later. Most importantly for archaeological investigations, the first
evidence of pottery began to emerge at sites from this period. Although the amount and
variety of pottery intensified during the Late Prehistoric, pottery is an excellent way of
determining the terminus post quem of a site.
The Late Prehistoric (also known as Woodland and Ceramic Periods) continue from the end
of the Archaic period to the historic period brought in by the Spanish Missions and AngloAmerican settlers. It is during this period that peoples known today as the Caddo, Atakapan,
and Bidai, are identifiable both culturally and materially. This is mostly due to the historical
sources of the seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries that aid in the reconstruction of
the past cultures in the area.

4.4 The Historic Period
Hernando De Soto encountered the Native Americans of the region during his expedition in
1542; it was the first recorded meeting with the Caddo peoples. The first expeditions by La
Salle in 1687 and the subsequent settlement in the eighteenth century by Europeans
continued to document the presence of Native American groups in the area (Aten 1984).
French traders and Spanish missionaries encountered the Hasinai, also known as the Neches
Angelina, who became allies of the Spanish against the western Apache tribes (Newcomb
1961).
In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Spanish and French used the Native
American groups as pawns in the two nations’ quest to settle the area (Newcomb 1961).
Most destructive for all native groups in the region was the influx of European diseases.

11

When Euro-American settlers began moving into the area en mass around the 1850s, disease
and warfare decimated the groups to near extinction.

5.0 RESULTS OF THE LITERATURE REVIEW AND
CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY
Site file research was initiated by reviewing records maintained by the TARL in Austin,
Texas, and by consulting on-line research archives maintained by the THC. Research was
conducted within a 1.6-kilometer (1-mile) study radius of the project area to identify all
previously recorded archaeological sites, historical markers, and historic structures eligible
for NRHP listing. Site file research was used to provide a historic context to the
archaeological survey. There are no previously recorded archeological sites within 1.6
kilometers (1 mile) of the project area.

5.1 Results of the Literature Review and Background Research
A total of 2 cultural resource surveys were conducted within a 1.6-kilometer (1-mile) radius
of the project area. The survey areas are plotted on Figure 1 and summaries of each
investigation are presented below.
The earliest survey conducted within proximity to the current project area was completed on
behalf of the Federal Highway Administration in 1993. This was the survey of State
Highway 35, and no cultural resources were recorded as a result of this survey. This survey
took place just north of the project area.
In 2003, a linear survey was conducted along State Highway 35 just east of the current
project area. This project was issued TAP #3091, and no cultural resources were
encountered.

5.2 Results of the Cultural Resources Survey
Portions of the project located within existing ROW were clearly disturbed and subjected to
reconnaissance survey only. This entailed 3.5 hectares (8.7 acres) of the APE and included
existing paved road and roadside ditches. Areas of proposed new ROW exhibited less than
10% surface visibility and required subsurface testing. As a result of the intensive pedestrian
investigation, a total of 62 subsurface tests were attempted along the project length. This
resulted in 58 subsurface tests performed across the APE (Figure 2). Four tests were not
excavated due to disturbance. All tests were excavated within proposed new ROW, outside
of existing ROW, and therefore on privately owned property. These entailed 33 shovel tests,
7 auger tests, and 18 shovel tests with supplemental auguring. Testing surpassed the THC
standard of 16 tests per 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of a linear project. A total of 24 tests were
attempted within the southern half of the project, approximately 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of
the project length. This portion of the project allowed only one transect to be subjected to
subsurface testing due to its overlap with the existing road (CR 359). A total of 34 tests were
attempted within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the remaining (north) portion of the project. The
width of this portion of the project allowed two transects to be examined,

although tests were concentrated in areas containing soils with a high probability for cultural
materials (essentially areas designated as PALM Unit 1) and were performed at 30-meter
(100-foot) intervals in these locations. Areas of the APE containing low probability soils for
cultural materials (designated as PALM Unit 3) were tested at wider spaced intervals or on a
judgmental basis to verify the soils mapped for the location. In an effort to determine the
existence of deeply buried and potentially cultural-bearing soils, auguring was performed at
25 test locations spread out across the APE.
Tests throughout the project area ranged in depth from 10 centimeters (3.93 inches) to 125
centimeters (49 inches) below the ground surface. Soil profiles within the APE reflected the
descriptions for those soils mapped for the area, consisting of clay or clay loam. The
construction of the existing CR 359, pipelines, power lines, and other activities within the
land parcels have resulted in some disturbance to the project area, but generally soils
appeared undisturbed. All tests were negative for cultural materials within and beyond the
depth of the APE. Detailed descriptions of all tests are provided in Appendix C.
No archaeological or historic properties were discovered as a result of survey of the APE and
thus will not be affected by the project (see 36 CFR 800.4[d.1]). Subsurface testing across
the project displayed soils consistent with those mapped for the location; however profiles
seemed to lack much of the upper horizons. Deep testing within areas containing high
potential soils did not reach any buried cultural horizons or paleosols within the project’s
proposed depth of impact. Rather instead of loamy recent alluvium, clays were typically
reached within 10 to 30 centimeters (4 to 12 inches) from the surface. In addition, soils
smelled strongly of petroleum. This is likely due to the proximity of the project location to
nearby refineries.

6.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
This report presents the findings of an intensive pedestrian cultural resources survey
conducted on a 3.3-kilometer (2-mile) long roadway re-alignment project. The project area is
42.7 meters (140 feet) wide, yielding an area of 15.0 hectares (37.2 acres) of both existing and
proposed new ROW. The archaeological survey strategy developed for the project included
pedestrian walkover survey, shovel test excavation, and auger testing. Fieldwork was
conducted in June and August of 2008 and February of 2009, and required 65 person hours to
complete. All fieldwork and reporting activities were completed with reference to state and
federal guidelines as outlined in Section 106 of the NHPA. The Lead Agency for this project
is TxDOT; the Texas Antiquities Permit Number is 5120.
Initial investigation consisted of a background literature and site file search to identify the
presence of recorded sites in close proximity to the current proposed project. No previously
recorded sites were located within a 1.6-kilometer (1 mile) study radius of the project area or
within the surveyed area.
Field investigation consisted of reconnaissance survey of existing ROW and intensive
pedestrian survey within proposed new ROW. All portions of project ROW that fall outside
of existing ROW are located on privately-owned land. Testing was based on TxDOT’s
PALM system and soils mapped in the area, thus creating high and low probability areas for
cultural deposits within the project. A total of 62 subsurface tests were attempted across the
project length. Subsurface investigation included the excavation of a total of 58 tests,
entailing 33 shovel tests, 7 auger tests, and 18 shovel tests with supplemental auguring. Four
tests were not conducted because of disturbance. Tests were at short intervals in high
probability areas for cultural deposits but at wider intervals in low probability areas.
The results of the survey indicate that no previously unidentified cultural resources are
located within the surveyed area and no newly identified archaeological sites were recorded.
Based on these results, HRA Gray & Pape recommends no further work and that the project
be allowed to proceed as planned.
All fieldwork and reporting activities were completed with reference to state (Texas
Antiquities Code [13 TAC 26]), and federal (36 CFR 800; 36 CFR 60) guidelines. In regards
to 36 CFR 800, the results of this survey specifically fall under section § 800.4(d.1): No
historic properties affected.
