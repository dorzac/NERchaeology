APPLICAnON OF ORTHOPHOTO MAPPING TO ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROBLEMS
ELTON R PREWITT
ROBERT K HOLZ
The results ofan experiment applying orthophoto mapping techniques to the Loeve-Fox site in Central Texas
are presented. This new mapping technique is described and suggestions for its application to archaeological
situations are made.

The development of scribecoat and, sub­
sequently, orthophoto mapping techniques in
recent years has resulted in significant changes
in the approach to cartography and cartog­
raphic problems. Precise controls can be estab­
lished and maintained in all stages of execution
of the cartographic process. This paper
emphasizes the application of orthophoto map­
ping to archaeological problems.
Scribecoat is "An actinically opaque plastic
coating (on a transparent base) that can be
removed by scraping to produce open areas"
(Robinson and Sale 1969:295). It consists of a
removable emulsion coating on a transparent
hard plastic sheet. The techniques of working
with scribecoat are explained in detail in
Robinson and Sale (1969:322-26). Orthophoto
is simply a variation of scribecoat where the
removable emulsion is light-sensitive and a
photographic print can be made directly upon
the work surface. Local engineering supply
houses should be contacted to determine the
local availability of brand name products.
ArchaeolOgists are generally naive both in
their attitude toward and conception of cartog­
raphy. Often, the drafting of site maps and
profiles are menial tasks assigned without
thought of the steps necessary to produce a
cartographically acceptable product. A glance
through any archaeological journal will reveal
that many archaeologists' conception of cartog­
raphy is limited to the drawing of a few lines on
paper with little regard to style, method,
balance, and content.

USES OF ORTHOPHOTO MAPPING
IN ARCHAEOLOGY

Although there has been widespread use of
remote sensing techniques in recent years, it has
not been oriented toward orthophoto mapping
(e.g., Gumennan and Neely 1972). There are
probably innumerable situations where ortho­
photo mapping can be applied to archaeolOgical
problems; five generalized problems are sug­
gested here. They are: (1) study areas; (2) site
maps; (3) floor plans; (4) profiles, and (5)
specific features.
Study Areas. Much of the archaeological
research done today is salvage directed toward
mitigating losses to be incurred as a direct result
of the construction of reservoirs, highways,
pipelines, housing developments, and the like.
Many of these projects utilize aerial mosaics
and the constituent photos in the detailed
engineering planning stages prior to actual
construction. Thus, the archaeologist has at his
disposal an excellent tool for use in graphically
displaying the physiographic, biotic, and
archaeologic situation within a given study area.
Study area or project outlines can be
superimposed directly upon an aerial mosaic by
use of orthophoto mapping. Attention can be
directed toward relevant phYSiographic or
biotic features, and archaeological sites can be
plotted precisely upon such a map. This could
be an invaluable aid to other archaeologists in
interpreting the relationships between sites and
biotic communities or physiographic features.

AMERICAN ANTIQUITY

Many construction projects are limited to
specific confines such as a pipeline right-of-way
or the immediate vinicity of a dam. Precise
plotting of sites on an orthophoto map can
assist a construction agency in attempts to
avoid damaging the sites, and reasons for
mitigation can be more easily explained by the
archaeologist.
Site distributions plotted on an orthophoto
map become more meaningful to most persons
when they can see where the sites are in
relation to familiar features than they are when
they have to depend upon interpretation (or
misinterpretation) of a contour map. If it is
necessary to depict relief more thoroughly, key
contour lines can be superimposed directly
upon an orthophoto map.
Site Maps. Site maps have always posed
problems for the archaeologist. In many cases
the archaeologist has no formal training in the
use of the transit or the alidade, but must rely
upon informal and often inadequate training
gained piecemeal from his predecessors and
contemporaries through trial-and-error experi­
ence. Orthophoto mapping can provide
accurate site maps upon which contour lines,
excavation units, or other features can be
superimposed with little difficulty. Not only
can the relevant features be shown upon it, but
it provides a permanent photographic record of
a site as it looked prior to excavation. Where
aerial mosaics are available, individual negatives
that include the site area can be selected for use
as the base map.
Floor Plans. Floor plans present a slightly
more difficult problem. Some sort of apparatus
for taking vertical photos would have to be
utilized by the archaeologist to take his own
photographs. This can generally be accomplish­
ed by ladders, scaffolding, or use of a backhoe.
Backhoes are excellent for photographing ex­
posed floors since the photographer can be
maneuvered to the center and can be placed at
a measurable height above the surface being
photographed. Relationships between features
included within a single floor could thus be
shown with more clarity than by simple line
drawings, and the original photograph would
again be a permanent record of this relation­
ship.
Profiles. An even greater problem than site
maps is posed by enigmatic profiles. It is a rare
site indeed when the stratigraphy is so clear

[Vol. 41, No.4, 1976]

that measured line drawings can be made of an
exposed profile with a reasonable degree of
confidence. Through the use of orthophoto
techniques, a more lucid representation of what
the archaeologist can see (or cannot see) can be
presented. Zones, lenses, or features can be
superimposed upon a photograph of the profile,
and the reader is left free to interpret the rest
of the profile himself.
Specific Features. Features encountered
within archaeological investigations are usually
recorded verbally, photographically, and by
measured sketches. These can be combined into
one lucid portrayal through the use of ortho­
photo mapping. As with floor plans, vertical
photographs would have to be made by the
archaeologist, but this should be a reasonably
simple task. The line drawings and photographs
usually presented as two illustrations could be
combined into one, and would give the reader a
more precise ponrayal of what is actually
contained within the ground. Fire hearths,
house floors, pits, and burials are particularly
suitable for orthophoto representation.

EXPERIMENT WITH A SITE MAP

In order to test the techniques we used
orthophoto mapping at the Loeve-Fox site (41
WM 230) in Williamson County, Texas. The
only aerial photo coverage available was from
the United States Department of Agriculture,
Soil Conservation Service. A vertical negative
could not be obtained for use as a base map.
Consequently, the senior author hired an
airplane and personally took aerial photos of
the site with a 2!4X3!4 Graflex camera. It was
not possible to correct for air apeed, and the
wind vibration of a bellows-type camera
produced minor effects in the clarity of the
photographs. Moreover, the photographs were
low obliques with uncontrolled scale variation,
rather than vertical.
For the sake of the experiment, it was
decided that the best of the photographs would
be used to test orthophoto mapping as applied
to archaeology, Thus, one exposure looking
south was selected; the negative was masked to
show the relevant features of the site and the
immediate surroundings. Masking consists of
taping an opaque covering (in this case black
construction paper) over those portions of the
negative which are not considered necessary for

illustration. It is important that the masking be
done so that the remaining exposed portion of
the negative is proportional to the desired size
of the finished print. An 18X24 inch enlarge­
ment was made on Contone brand coated
plastic. Scribing instruments (described in
Robinson and Sale 1969:323-24) with various
blade sizes were then used to outline the site
area and adjacent features.
All lettering, including site designations,
excavation unit designations , and topographic
features was done on a separate sheet of clear
acetate. Register pins were used to correlate
this overlay with the scribed base. Since the
original photograph was an oblique shot , no
attempt was made to depict the precise outlines
of the excavation units. Rather, simple triangles
were used to show the general area of the
excavation units. Relevant modern cultural
features were also drawn on the acetate overlay
rather than scribing them on the Contone.
The result of this experiment is a three-part
series of components designed for the produc-

495

tion of a single map. The basic component is a
masked negative of an aerial photograph of the
Loeve-Fox site. The next component is a
scribed exposure of the first component, and is
a second negative showing outlines of selected
features. The third component is an acetate
overlay containing all lettering and other
relevant information.
These components are used to make a series
of negatives at the size desired for final use in a
monograph or other publication. First, the
masked negative is enlarged to the effective
page size and a halftone negative produced
from it. The scribed and lettered components
are reduced to the appropriate size using the
halftone negative as a guide. If this order of
production is not followed, the resulting print
will not be registered precisely.
Any number of variations in color can be
used for the final print of an orthophoto map .
For instance , Fig. I was originally reproduced
with green tint to intensify the effect of the

County, Texas (not illustrated), was printed
with brown tint to intensify the effect of the
semi-arid desert environment.
Comparison of the finished orthophoto map
(Fig. I) with a standard transit map of the same'
site (Fig. 2) points out the advantages of both
types of maps. The orthophoto map gives the
reader a better "feel" for the current distribu­
tion of wooded versus grassland areas, and their
relationships to the river, fossil stream channels,
and a larger area of the valley as well as to the
site. The standard map lacks the scope of the
orthophoto map, butgives a better depiction of
topogIaphic detail. Conversely, detailed ortho­
photo maps of specific features such as hearths,
living surfaces, and profiles provide clearer
spatial depiction of desired objects or relation­
ships of objects.
One negative feature of orthophoto mapping
is the expense of production. High quality
scribing tools cost about $5.00 per point, light
sensitive scribecoat costs in the neighborhood
of $50.00 per 18X24 inch sheet, and mUltiple
component figure prints increase slightly in cost

per additional component (about one cost unit
per run when more than one ink color is used).

CONCLUSIONS

Orthophoto mapping is a valuable cartog­
raphic tool that can be applied successfully to
archaeological situations. Precise reservoir or
site maps can be made when aerial photo
negatives are available. Specific relationships
among archaeological sites, the biota, and the
physiography can be shown clearly on ortho­
photo maps. It is postulated that the same
success can be applied to floor plans, proftles,
and specific features within a site.
The expenses incurred in orthophoto map­
ping are somewhat higher than those involved
in standard line drawings. However, such cost
increases are insignificant when the results
enhance the visual presentation of archaeologi­
cal data. These conclusions are not intended to
tout orthophoto mapping as a complete re­
placement for conventional line drawings;
rather they are intended to paint out an
alternative method whereby more precise data
may be presented in archaeological reports.

The figurine collection of the late Waldemar
Julsrud, excavated in the vicinity of Acambaro,
Guanajuato, Mexico, during the early 1940s,
has created interest and controversy. Descrip·
tions and analyses have appeared in a number
of publications (J ulsrud 1947; DiPeso 1953a,
1953b; Hapgood 1973). The purpose of this
report is to show that reported therrno­
luminescent (TL) dates for this collection are
invalid. Furthermore, we wish to introduce
evidence that the objects were fired shortly
before they were found.

Previously published thermoluminescent and
radiocarbon dates for this collection range
between 6480±170 BP and 3060±120 BP (Hap­
good 1973: to). The thermoluminescent dates
in this sequence are invalid. Furthermore, a
note in the latest monograph of Hapgood
(1973: 10), concerning the retraction of the TL
dates, is in error. He states the reason these
dates are unacceptable is that the firing temper­
ature is too low for accurate dating. We have
performed measurements that show the firing
temperature was between 450°C and 650°C.
