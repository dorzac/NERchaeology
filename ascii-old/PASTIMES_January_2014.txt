Archeological Investigations at the Colonel John L. Gregg Battle Site
(41RD77), Randall County, Texas, 1872. By Alvin Lynn and Rolla Shaller.
Part II
Results
Of the 209 recorded artifacts collected from the Gregg battle site
(Table 1), 51 percent relate to ammunition and armaments, 21 percent to animal husbandry, 23 percent to equipment and supplies, 3 percent to personal
objects, and 2 percent to miscellaneous items. Recent unassociated artifacts
were collected and removed from the site but not recorded. These items
consisted of nails, fence staples, shot shell brass, nuts, bolts, and other various pieces of broken farm machinery.
Ammunition and Armaments
The majority of the brass cartridge cases collected are .50/70 caliber
(Figure 4: items 1, 3-5, and 6). The .50 caliber carbine was the standard
issue of the U.S. Cavalry in 1872. With the exception of one Berdan
(externally primed) cartridge case, all of the cartridge cases are internally
primed. Four of the recovered cartridges are broken and have never been
fired. Also recovered were two 56/50 Spencer cartridge cases designed by
the Springfield Armory in 1861 (Thomas and Thomas 1996). These cartridge cases were used in the 1865 model Spencer repeating carbine.
Two .44 caliber Henry cartridges (Figure 7: item #116) recovered at the site
were developed by B. Tyler Henry for the lever action repeating rifle that
bears his name and were manufactured by the New Haven Arms Company
(1860-1866). Three .32 caliber rim fire cartridge cases found up-slope to the
northwest of the site are possibly from the firearms used by the Kiowa.
Three spherical lead balls used in percussion type firearms were also recovered: specimen 142, with a diameter of .348 in and a weight of 64.5 grains;
specimen 162, .382 in and 137.5 grains; and specimen 168, .43 in and 137.5
grains.

Additional items collected from the site
include 11 Berdan cartridge cases from a later
period. Five are .40/82 cartridge cases (Figure 4:
item #2) that are head-stamped D.C. Co.
(indicating they were manufactured by the Dominion Cartridge Co.); these cartridge cases
were made for the 1885 Winchester single shot
and also for the 1886 Winchester lever-action
repeating rifle. The remaining 6 were manufactured by the Union Metallic Cartridge Co.: 3
are .44 caliber CFW (center-fire Winchester)
cases, and 3 are .45 Colt cartridge cases (Logan
1959). Two .50 caliber bullets, one of which is

mushroomed (Figures 6 and 7), were also recovered.

Twenty-five conical-shaped .44 caliber

bullets (Figure 5: items 55, 56, and 58) show no
evidence of use. These bullets may be the remains of paper cartridges that were dropped and
lost during the battle since they were all found in
the same general location. These cartridges are
typical of the cartridges used in early Remington
and Colt military handguns. Eight other unidentified lead bullets were also recovered from the

site.

brass brad: #57; musket nipple wrench: #59.
Two military type combination gun tools were also recovered. One, a musket nipple wrench (Figure 5:

item #59) that fits most muskets and rifles, was first issued with the Mississippi Rifle and later used with the
Sharps Rifle. The second tool is a combination screwdriver (3 blades) and mainspring clamp (Figure 6: item
#98) that was issued for the model 1866 rifle. This tool was made from the old percussion lock screwdriver by
cutting off the cone wrench and making a notch in the stump, which serves to clamp the mainspring when dismounting the lock (Kirkland 1989). Two brass pieces shown in Figure 8 (item #150) may be fragments of a
brass trigger guard.

Animal husbandry
Recovered artifacts that relate to animal husbandry consist of metallic pieces
used in the construction of harnesses and
saddles. The following items were found: 5
harness buckles, a cinch ring (Figure 5: item
#54), brass brads and rivets (Figure 5: item
#57), mule shoes and horseshoes (Figure 9:
item #200), 16 horseshoe nails (Figure 9:
item #199), and 1 brass guard plate or oval
(Figure 6: item #101) from the rear of the

tary saddle.
Equipment and Supplies
Four sections of various types of link
k chains collected, along with various hooks
and metal parts, probably came from the supply wagons.

Other identified wagon parts

include a wagon rod spacer and a wagon bow
staple. Several fragments and parts of leadsealed metal cans were also collected. The
largest of the can fragments recorded is a
base section (Figure 8: item #154) that may
have been a container for foodstuffs.
The following artifacts are similar to
those from the Red River War Battle Sites

boxes and crates.

Personal Effects
A limited number of metallic artifacts
of a personal nature were recovered from the
site and surrounding area: three 4-hole metal
clothing buttons and one 2-bladed pocket or
jack knife (both blades hinged from the same
end) that measures 3 5/8 in in length with both
knife blades broken at mid-blade and folded
closed. Attached to one side of the knife body
is a partial, checkered bone grip. The body of
the knife has an unusual square, blunt-metal
distal end. No brand names or manufacturing
information were found on any of these artifacts.
Also recovered was one brass military
eagle uniform button (Figure 7: item #113),
back marked “Wm Lang/Boston, Mass.” This
button was most likely manufactured by William Lang of Boston, Massachusetts, a merchant in West India goods. Lang had an Army
contract on April 14, 1857, for 1,050 gross Figure 8. Decorated brass piece: #150; woodscrew: #151; brass
coat buttons and 1,250 gross vest buttons bracelet: #152; .45 caliber center fire cartridge case: #153; end

the eagle button with the Lang’s back mark is from this contract. Two round wire brass bracelets (Figure 8:
item #152) similar to ones worn by Southern Plains Indians during the mid to late 1800s were found south of
the creek and may be associated with the battle.
Miscellaneous
Several pieces of miscellaneous brass, iron, and lead materials from the site were collected and recorded. Some of these have yet to be identified, so they may or may not be associated with the 1872 battle.
As stated previously, agricultural artifacts of a more recent manufacture and present-day debris were not recorded.

Floyd V. Studer Annual Banquet
Saturday Evening, December 14th, the Panhandle Archaeological Society held the annual Floyd V. Studer
Banquet at the Panhandle Plains Historical Museum in the Hazelwood Room. The evening began with a social
hour of visiting and silent auction bidding. President Donna Otto welcomed members and visitors. A prayer
was lead by Dick Carter, followed by a buffet catered by Hills of Canyon.
A brief business meeting was held. Donna Otto asked Beryl Hughes, Nominating Chair, to present the slate
of officers for the next two years. The following is the slate
presented by the Nominating Committee:
Donna Otto, President
Scott Brosowske, Vice President
Pamela Allison, Treasurer
Mary Ruth Carter, Secretary
There were no nominations from the floor. A motion
was made and seconded to accept the slate of officer as presented. All members voted approval, none opposed.
The evening proceeded to the featured speaker, Battlefield Archaeologist Douglas D. Scott, presenting “A Buf- Michael Grauer, curator of art for PPHM, presented a

He is particularly noted for his expertise in battlefield archeology and firearms identification and has
worked on more than 40 battlefield sites, including Palo Alto, Sand creek, Big Hole, Bear Paw, Wilson’s
Creek, Pea Ridge, Centralia and Santiago de Cuba. He was awarded the Department of Interior Distinguished
Service Award in 2002 for his innovative research in battlefield archeology that started with his work at the
Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument.
The event culminated in raffle drawings, announcement of silent auction winners and a live auction, overseen by Alvin
Lynn. Informational and entertaining, the
banquet was attended by 43 with an additional nine coming to hear the featured
speaker.
The silent and live auctions offered
various items, and, including the raffle,
the society received close to $700.00 in
these fundraising efforts. Our thanks go
