ABSTRACT
On behalf of American Electric Power (AEP) and the Lower Colorado River
Authority (LCRA), archeologists from Hicks & Company (H&C) conducted
mitigation excavations at Site 41UV68 in Uvalde County, Texas (approximately
14 total acres of site area; TAC Permit 3833). While initially observed in the
1970s, Site 41UV68 was intensively studied following an archeological survey of
more than 100 proposed miles of transmission line upgrades connecting Eagle
Pass to Asherton and Uvalde to Del Rio. The site was recommended for testing
following survey documentation and was tested in the summer of 2004.
Following testing excavations at the site (TAC Permit 3539), archeologists
focused excavations on impacted site areas that were found to contain the
highest potential for intact cultural features (particularly along the two-track
access road that runs through the center of the site area). In two phases of
excavation, archeologists dug a series of 13 contiguous and non-contiguous
backhoe trenches along the access road and strung and excavated a series of
five 1 x 2 meter and 2 x 2 meter test units at key feature locations unearthed
during trenching. An additional 1 x 2 meter test unit was excavated at
Transmission Line Pole 1/5, whose location was revised subsequent to testing
excavations. In all a total of 19 features were documented during trenching with
seven investigated in more detail through test unit study. The revised Pole 1/5
test unit was found to be devoid of any intact cultural materials. Diagnostic tool
and organic radiocarbon data recovered during the mitigation investigation
presents the site history along the access road as a series of shallowly
overprinted, and generally intact, Late/Transitional Archaic and Late Prehistoric
occupations within the upper 60 centimeters of sediments. Large earth ovens
(Feature 9) limited to the upper 40 centimeters shed light on food processing at
the site during the Austin Phase of the Late Prehistoric (rare for this region of
the state). Organic materials recovered from within the features (particularly
Feature 9) provided abundant evidence of food (hackberry and wild onion) and
fuel (mesquite) preferences of the site occupants over time.
Immediately
following field work, H&C archeologists submitted an interim letter to the THC
detailing the excavations and initial findings from artifact analysis. The THC
concurred with the recommendation for the construction to begin (letter
7/22/05). H&C further recommends any further work at the site between the
access road and Cooks Slough should be preceded with a detailed investigation
for further significant archeological deposits.
All site-related materials,
including forms, photographs, drawings and artifacts were collected and will be
permanently housed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory.

Executive Summary

1.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
On behalf of American Electric Power (AEP) and the Lower Colorado River
Authority (LCRA), archeologists from Hicks & Company (H&C) conducted limited
data recovery excavations along potentially impacted portions of Site 41UV68,
immediately north of the AEP Uvalde Substation in Uvalde County, Texas
(Figure 1). The site was first tested in 2004 (TAC Permit 3539) in support of a
proposed transmission line upgrade extending from the Uvalde Substation in
Uvalde to the Hamilton Road Substation in Del Rio. During testing, sediments
surrounding Pole 1/5 and along the construction access road contained
discreet, intact archeological materials and feature concentrations as well as
significant organic preservation.
Both areas would have been potentially
impacted by the proposed construction, so H&C recommended mitigation work
in these impacted areas. The excavation proceeded under TAC Permit 3833.
The excavation’s stratigraphic, geomorphic, diagnostic artifact, and
compositional data indicate a series of sequential, well preserved, long lived
prehistoric occupations (4000 to 800 B.P.) at Site 41UV68. The site contains
three reasonably stratified prehistoric occupation zones consisting of discrete
hearth features, associated occupational debris of consistent composition, and
excellent charcoal and floral preservation, located at different elevations within
approximately 80 centimeters of alluvial sediments.
Through two phases of excavation (trenching and test unit hand excavation),
archeologists studied approximately 50.5 cubic meters of sediment from one
long backhoe trench divided into nine sections and four isolated trenches (36.5
cubic meters) and six hand-excavated test units (13.8 cubic meters). In the
process, a total of 19 prehistoric burned rock and sediment stain features of
varying size and composition were documented. Seven of these were subject to
detailed analysis within test units, including one well preserved, large rock-lined
pit feature. A total of 14 projectile points, 73 other stone tools, 22,230 grams of
debitage, seven grams of bone, and 454 grams of shell (snail and mussel) were
recovered/collected in the hand excavations and trenches. Nine diagnostic
artifacts (projectile points) were recovered in feature context. A total of 71
sediment samples (44 column, 17 float, 10 humate dating) and 31 separate
charred organic remains (charcoal samples) were collected from test unit and
feature contexts.
As per the research design, proposed vehicular impacts to a connecting access
road resulting from transmission line upgrades, and the location of intact
archeological deposits at the proposed location of Pole 1/5 are mitigated through
the excavation of the trench and associated hand excavation units.

2.0 INTRODUCTION
2.1

FRAMEWORK
In September of 2004, H&C archeologists conducted the testing phase of site
investigations at all proposed impacted portions of Site 41UV68 (TAC Permit
3539, Miller et al. 2005). Three 1 x 2 meter test units were excavated adjacent
to the site’s three transmission line poles slated for replacement (Units 1-3 at,
respectively, Poles 1/4, 1/5, and 1/6).
In addition, citing potential
construction-related impacts likely along the maintenance road that parallels
the target transmission line, four 1 x 2 meter test units were excavated to the
proposed depth of impact at the road (25 centimeters below the surface, Units 4­
7) at various points on the landform adjacent to Cooks Slough.
The locations of Poles 1/4 and 1/6 were severely disturbed and dismissed from
further investigations. The location of Pole 1/5 (Figure 2) contained a series of
well preserved intact Late and Transitional Archaic archeological deposits
shallowly buried and concentrated at 40 centimeters below the surface. Hearth
features, charcoal and associated projectile points were collected and
documented during the testing phase. Large areas of access road deposits
contained evidence of similar intact, shallowly buried prehistoric materials
located adjacent and parallel to Cooks Slough. The research design for the
limited mitigation was carefully coordinated with the LCRA and THC. The
research design required exploratory trenching of the access road, hand
excavation and documentation of up to 12 cubic meters of access road
sediments, the excavation of another 1 x 2 meter unit at the proposed location of
Pole 1/5, and the complete mitigation level analysis of all excavated
archeological materials. Since the testing phase, AEP offset the proposed
location of Pole 1/5, 11 feet to the northwest as illustrated in Figure 3.

METHODOLOGY
The initial phase of field investigations involved the excavation of a long 135­
meter trench divided into nine contiguous trench segments (Trenches 1-9) along
the center of the road followed by four additional, non-contiguous trenches
extending into gravelly, sterile sediments.
In all test units, sediments were excavated by hand, using standard excavation
equipment (trowels, shovels, picks, brushes, etc.) and screened through ¼-inch
steel wire mesh. All artifacts recovered were collected including lithic debitage,
tools and tool fragments, shell, bone and historic debris. Given their importance
in documenting subsurface disturbance, all relevant provenience data was
recorded for each piece of modern debris. These items were not collected but
were rather discarded following documentation. All collected materials were
given incremental lot numbers, arbitrarily assigned based upon their excavation
context (in some instances the artifacts from an entire unit/level received a
single lot, while in others individual, important tools, etc. were assigned an
individual lot number). At the beginning of each unit/level excavation, a 20 x 20
x 10-centimeter sample of soils from a corner of the unit was excavated and
collected for floatation and sediment sampling. Where warranted (particularly in
feature contexts) additional sediment samples were also collected. Each sample
received its own sample number and a specific lot number. Excavators were
instructed to pay particular attention to possible charcoal fragments that would
be unearthed during digging. Each of these samples was collected individually,
given a sequential C-14 sample number and assigned a unique lot number. A
select group of these samples has been sent to Beta Analytic for further analysis
and dating. All unit excavation was supplemented with thorough records
including individual unit/level, sediment sample, C-14, and feature forms.
Additionally, researchers produced detailed drawings and photographs at the
opening and closing of each unit/level throughout the excavation process.
These graphic representations provide valuable visual information that is lost
following field study. Finally, the project’s Principal Investigator as well as
Project Archeologist documented the crew’s activities through daily journals.
For increased accuracy in the collection of site data as well as its subsequent
presentation, H&C archeologists employed a Sokkia Set 500-F Total Data
Station (TDS) and a Sokkia SDR 33 Data Collector. With the aid of this
equipment, H&C mapped the four corners of each of the excavation units (to
within a five millimeter accuracy), and documented each unit datum to facilitate
an overall “arbitrary 100” site elevation system of depth measurement. Site and
unit datums put in place during site testing were relocated, allowing electronic
surveyors to tie new data in with existing unit and feature location information.
Additionally, the three-dimensional mapping capability of the TDS was employed
to create a detailed, accurate topographic representation of the site area.
Plotting the TDS information into Golden Software Surfer®, a site area
topographic map was produced. These data have been employed to postulate
ancient landforms, interpret geomorphic variation of the landscape and
supplement existing topographic maps of the area. Additionally, following a
brief surface inspection, significant tools, cores and clusters of artifacts were
flagged and mapped, providing a precise yet select representation of surficial tool
distribution across the potentially disturbed portions of the site area.
Once field investigations were completed, all collected materials were brought
back to the lab for analysis. Lithic debitage and tools were cleaned, counted and

weighed.
Additionally, H&C archeologists conducted a lithic analysis of
unbroken flakes and tools recovered throughout the site investigation. Selected
sediment samples recovered from test unit corners or from within direct feature
context were analyzed through flotation screening. Each analyzed sample was
soaked and separated in water then flushed through a series of four nested
mesh screens whose mesh openings ranged from two millimeters to 350
microns. Material types were tallied and weighed for each screen division and
recorded. Select samples of charcoal collected from key site and test unit
contexts were gathered and sent for AMS-standard delivery radiocarbon dating.
Dates provided from these tests were used to better interpret feature integrity
and site age overall. Sediment descriptions gathered through the course of test
unit excavation (excavation narratives, feature descriptions, test unit profile
drawings and photographs) were utilized to construct a geomorphological
representation of the site area and the processes involved in site creation and
erosion over time. Additionally, shell and bone counts from test units were
documented for subsistence studies where warranted. Data from these analyses
was entered into a custom-fabricated site database that incorporates an
exhaustive array of excavation data and produces detailed site trends and exact
tallies of materials and samples collected during the course of test unit
excavation. The information produced from these data, in conjunction with
observations made in the field, was the prime resource for all site discussions
and regulatory conclusions made through the remainder of the site discussions
found in proceeding sections.

ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS
James Karbula functioned as the project’s Principal Investigator while Mason
Miller performed the duties of Project Archeologist. Additionally, Brian King and
Brad Jones acted as Crew Chiefs. Bryan Farabough, Jim Gillentine, Virginia
Moore, Matthew Stotts and Lindsay Flood rounded out the project’s research
crew. Fieldwork was conducted during July and August of 2005 while initial
analysis and interim letter production was conducted through September of the
same year. Formal analysis and report production continued through January
of 2007. Maps, figures and photographs were compiled and produced by Mason
Miller, Hans Jürgen-Dietrich and Kevin Contrino.
All excavation-related
materials, including field notes, samples, artifacts and the final report will be
curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL). Succeeding
sections of this report include a brief cultural chronology of the region followed
by a history of the documentation of Site 41UV68 followed by a description of
the current mitigation research design. Following these chapters, this report
includes a Geomorphic, Environmental and Archeological Setting section which
outlays the overall contextual background of the site area including site
landscape, site formation processes and other information. Next, a Results of
Field Investigations chapter will lay out all discoveries in the field, detailing all
test units, features and surface inspection finds. Finally, a Discussions and
Conclusions section outlines H&C’s interpretations regarding site finds and
recommendations for eventual regulatory project clearance.

Cultural History

3.0 CULTURAL HISTORY
Site 41UV68 lies along the transitional frontier between the central and
southern Texas archeological sub-regions. Found at the western edge of the
Edwards Plateau as it transitions to the Southern Texas Plains and Rio Grande
Valley, Uvalde County exhibits an archeological record that begins roughly 7,000
years ago and generally follows trends observed within both regions (Ochoa
2006). Since south Texas is more accurately defined as an occupational zone
and not a location of unique occupational chronology (Hester 2004) and the
chronology that is present in the area relatively closely mimics that of central
Texas, that region will be summarized in more detail below. The sequence from
Collins (2004) is as follows: Paleoindian period (ca.11, 500-8,800 Before Present
[B.P.]), Archaic period (ca. 8,800-1,200 B.P.), the Late Prehistoric period (1,200­
400 B.P.), and the Historic Period (400 B.P. to present). The 6,600-year Archaic
period is typically further subdivided into Early (8,800-6,000 B.P.), Middle
(6,000-4,000 B.P.) and Late (4,000-1,200 B.P.).

BACKGROUND
3.1.1

TEXAS

PREHISTORIC

ARCHEOLOGICAL

Paleoindian Period (11,500-8,800 B.P.)
Though previous theories postulate that Paleoindian peoples were highly mobile
and heavily reliant on big game hunting (Suhm et al. 1954, Hester 1980), more
current investigations have contradicted this model (Collins 2004). One reason
for this is that until recently, few Paleoindian sites within the central Texas area
had been well studied. However, work at sites such as Pavo Real near San
Antonio, Wilson-Leonard in Williamson County and the Gault Site in Bell
County have shown that Paleoindian peoples adhered to a more generalized
hunting and gathering strategy in which they might return to the same site
repeatedly on a seasonal basis. Within central Texas most Paleoindian sites are
located along the ecotonal region between the Balcones Escarpment and the
Blackland Prairie, suggesting that these campsites were intentionally situated to
exploit a variety of resources. Faunal remains collected from sites like Wilson
Leonard, Pavo Real and the Gault site support this idea. So too do lithic
artifacts and other features. Paleoindian lithic artifact types comprise a diverse
assemblage derived from biface, flake and prismatic blade technology (Collins
2004), in addition to engraved limestone, stone bolas and ochre. Projectile
points typically consist of well-made fluted lanceolate points produced from high
quality chert. A stone-paved floor found in the Kinkaid Rock Shelter attests to
an advanced degree of social organization and stability (Collins 2004).

3.1.2

Archaic Period (ca. 8,800-1,200 B.P.)
The Archaic spans over 9,000 years of prehistory and is typically divided into
subperiods, which reflect changes in technology, site type, and density. Lithic
technology changed radically during this time, from one reliant on prismatic
blades to one oriented more toward multidirectional core utilization. Dart points
typically became smaller and stemmed. In general it is posited that early Archaic
occupations were small, widely distributed, and non-specialized (Black and
McGraw 1985). Like the Paleoindian period that preceded it, the Early Archaic
peopled were highly nomadic hunter-gatherers practicing a generalized

Cultural History

subsistence strategy. Archeologists typically believe that population density was
low during the Early Archaic period, steadily increasing into the Late Archaic.
Burned Rock middens appear first in the Early Archaic period. Burned rock
midden sites are considered to be characteristic of central Texas archeology
(Black 1989) of the Archaic period. These fire-cracked and discolored limestone
rock features are found in creek terrace or upland settings and have other
cultural materials within and around them indicating an open occupation site
(Black 1989). Burned rock middens are circular, mounded accumulations some
10-25 meters across, having a basic annular (concentric) morphology (i.e., a
dense ring or rocks surrounding a distinct center and surrounded by a thinning
periphery; Black et al. 1997). The wide variety of plant and animal remains
found within middens suggests that these ovens served as communal plant and
animal processing facilities. Ultimately, it is believed that burned rock middens
are a consequence of perhaps hundreds of cooking fires that were used and
reused in one place over many years (Black et al. 1997).
3.1.3

Late Prehistoric Period (1,200-400 B.P.)
The Late Prehistoric in central Texas is marked initially by the replacement of
the dart and atlatl with the bow and arrow (Johnson 1995). Larger dart points
are replaced by small, thin arrow points. Typical types found in central Texas
include Scallorn and Perdiz. Biface technology appears to lose importance,
while other lithic tool types, such as unifacial end scrapers, flake tools,
alternately beveled knives, and drills occur more frequently on Late Prehistoric
sites. Despite this shift in technology, there is every indication that a broadbased hunting and gathering subsistence persisted into the Late Prehistoric
period, though groups seem to have been less mobile, frequently returning to
campsites on a seasonal basis. Pottery appears for the first time on Late
Prehistoric sites in central Texas. Central Texas pottery was typically made of
sandy paste, and tempered with bone or shell.

4.0 PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Over the course of almost 30 years, Site 41UV68, located north and west of the
Uvalde Substation on the western outskirts of the City of Uvalde, has undergone
a series of five archeological investigations (including the testing project
discussed in this volume). Located adjacent to a prominent local waterway,
Cooks Slough, the site was initially described as a terrace site of unknown size
and was later refined to include potentially significant surficial and buried
historic and prehistoric archeological materials. The majority of site studies
have taken place between 2003 and 2004 as part of proposed upgrades to a
transmission line extending from the Uvalde Substation to the Hamilton Road
Substation outside of Del Rio. Below is a brief discussion of the four previous
stages of the study of Site 41UV68, the findings therein and their bearing on the
current testing-phase investigations of target portions of the site (Figure 4).

4.1

INITIAL SITE DISCOVERY
Records on file at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) indicate
that the site was originally recorded by Daymond Crawford of the State
Department of Highways and Public Transportation (now TxDOT) in 1975,
presumably in advance of the extension/improvement of FM 1435. The site was
recorded as a “terrace site” with a dense scatter of burned rock and lithic
debitage on the east bank of Cooks Slough. The original investigator noted that
the site appeared to be undisturbed with little erosion, and that the area may
have been cultivated at one time. At the time of the initial survey the site
boundaries were undetermined (listed as “undetermined, but large”) and the site
was recommended for further investigation.

4.2

SURVEY PHASE DOCUMENTATION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
During archeological survey for proposed upgrades to the Uvalde to Del Rio
transmission line, which emanates from the Uvalde Substation, Hicks &
Company archeologists determined that site 41UV68 extends into the area of the
substation and the associated transmission line corridor to the west (Miller et al.
2003; TAC Permit 3157). Investigations during that survey, which focused
primarily on a single transmission line corridor approximately 100 feet wide,
found that the site is laterally extensive (extending more than 650 meters along
the survey path and an unknown distance outside of the easement) and
includes prehistoric and historic components. A total of 14 shovel tests were
excavated within the transmission line corridor in the site area in conjunction
with intensive surface inspection. Through the course of this investigation,
researchers documented a large surficial lithic scatter that included lithic
debitage, biface fragments, groundstone and burned rocks. On the ground
surface a short distance north of the transmission line along the edge of a
meander of Cooks Slough, H&C archeologists also documented a roughly ringshaped possible burned rock midden eroding down the hillslope. The feature
contained a moderate to dense accumulation of very angular, highly fractured
burned rocks along with two manos, several biface fragments, and numerous
pieces of debitage. Shovel testing along the survey corridor indicated the
presence of a distinctive lens of cultural materials (particularly along site areas
west of the Slough) from 20 to 40 centimeters below the ground surface, while
materials were observed as deep as 90 centimeters below the surface.
Additionally, two apparently intact hearth features were encountered within as

many shovel tests. These both exhibited good organic preservation in the form
of bone and charcoal.
The historic site component was recorded on the western side of Cooks Slough
primarily between poles 1/5 and 1/6. Site artifacts primarily consisted of a
variety of historic glass shards, ceramic sherds and occasional rusted metal
fragments. No apparent architectural remnants or relic yardscapes could be
found within the survey easement and it is hypothesized that this portion of Site
41UV68 is likely part of a much larger historic trash dump that extends across
the property fenceline to the north for an undetermined distance. All historic
artifacts were limited roughly to the ground surface while some materials were
recorded at shallow depths within shovel tests.
Following the initial documentation of Site 41UV68 during the transmission line
survey, H&C researchers focused their attention on its prehistoric elements.
The proposed construction would only impact a small portion of the historic site
component. Therefore, the portion of the historic site overlapping with proposed
project impacts was recommended as ineligible for National Register or SAL
listing and for regulatory clearance. Given the presence of burned rock features
and a highly variable lithic assemblage, the investigators concluded that the
prehistoric component(s) of Site 41UV68 represents an open occupation
campsite where a variety of prehistoric behaviors may have taken place. The
investigators further suggested that the prehistoric aspect of the site may
represent considerable research potential in the form of intact, buried
archeological deposits and burned rock features which exhibit good organic
preservation. Citing the abundant surficial materials attributed to the site, all
vehicular traffic was recommended to cease through the site area.
The
prehistoric aspect of the site was recommended for formal NRHP/SAL testing if
impacted by the transmission line upgrade project.

4.3

GEOTECHNICAL BORE TEST SURVEY
Following site survey, H&C produced a field report and outlined their
recommendations regarding the site. Following THC concurrence with these
recommendations (letter, Prikryl to Bruseth, 12/09/03), any further
construction activities would require close coordination with archeologists. As
part of the planned upgrades to the Uvalde to Del Rio transmission line,
construction engineers dug a series of geotechnical bores at regular intervals
along the corridor. These tests were excavated to determine the subsurface
composition of the transmission line path to aid in pole placement. One of these
tests was slated at Pole 1/6, directly within the highest concentration areas of
Site 41UV68. In an effort to find a viable alternative boring location that would
not adversely affect potentially significant subsurface site elements, H&C
researchers excavated a series of three shovel tests increasingly southward from
the target bore pit pole under the auspices of the existing TAC Permit (60, 103
and 136 feet south of Pole 1/6; letter, Karbula to Bruseth, 03/04/04). Through
these tests, archeologists again noted the same consistent lens of cultural
materials from 20 to 40 centimeters observed in the previous site survey. Chert
debitage and burned rocks were encountered (in one shovel test or another) in
every excavation level from the surface to the 100-centimeter terminus. Shovel
testing data, however, did indicate a marked decrease in artifact density toward
the south, particularly between 100 and 136 feet south of the pole. As such
H&C researchers recommended that the bore test could be dug at a given
location no less than 100 feet south of Pole 1/6 without impacting significant

site features. Additionally the only vehicle permitted to drive to the bore location
was the bore rig itself, which uses large-volume, low-pressure tires that would
not likely damage surficial site elements.

4.4

UVALDE SUBSTATION LAYDOWN AREA TESTING
As part of additional planned construction projects including that of the Uvalde
to Del Rio transmission line, AEP proposed the placement of a large,
rectangular, asphalt and gravel laydown area at the north end of the existing
Uvalde Substation. The area would encompass an area of approximately 1.6
acres and would be used for the storage of large pieces equipment and other
construction-related materials. The proposed location of this laydown area is
east of Cooks Slough, immediately adjacent to the known, surveyed boundaries
of Site 41UV68 and within projected site areas outside of the survey area.
Having not been directly studied up to this point, there was no knowledge of
how much of the site, if any, extended into the proposed construction area of
potential effect (APE). As such, this portion of the Uvalde Substation area was
slated for a pedestrian survey supplemented with shovel tests.
Acting under TAC Permit 3448, archeologists from H&C dug a series of 11
shovel tests throughout the proposed laydown area (Karbula and Jarvis 2004)
and found that, while present, elements of Site 41UV68 were widely scattered
and highly disturbed in this locale. Throughout the survey area, numerous
prehistoric artifacts were intermixed with modern and historic debris such as
asphalt and brick. In one shovel test, dug adjacent to the eastern bank of Cooks
Slough, yielded iron and brick from 90-100 centimeters below the ground
surface. Prehistoric materials not found within disturbed soils (particularly
found along the eastern perimeter of the survey boundary) were routinely
shallow and intermixed with gravels. No hearth features or diagnostic artifacts
were observed during the survey, though a variety of cores, bifacial tools, burned
rocks and lithic debitage were found throughout the study. It was apparent that
much of the site area found east of Cooks Slough would likely contain similarly
compromised site components, in opposition to those found west of the
waterway. Through this investigation, archeologists concluded that while the
proposed laydown area is conclusively part of the site, the APE is so extensively
disturbed through both modern and natural influences that this portion of Site
41UV68 did not require further investigation. The portion of Site 41UV68
overlapping the Laydown area was recommended as ineligible for the NRHP or as
a SAL and construction was recommended to proceed.

4.5

TESTING INVESTIGATIONS
In September of 2004, H&C archeologists conducted the testing phase of site
investigations at all proposed impacted portions of Site 41UV68 (TAC Permit
3539, Miller et al. 2005). Three 1 x 2 meter test units were excavated adjacent
to the site’s three transmission line poles slated for replacement (Units 1-3 at,
respectively, Poles 1/4, 1/5, and 1/6).
In addition, citing potential
construction-related impacts likely along the maintenance road that parallels
the target transmission line, four 1 x 2 meter test units were excavated to the
proposed depth of impact at the road (25 centimeters below the surface, Units 4­
7) at various points on the landform adjacent to Cooks Slough.

Previous Investigations

The locations of Poles 1/4 and 1/6 were severely disturbed and dismissed from
further investigations. The location of Pole 1/5 contained a series of wellpreserved intact Late and Transitional Archaic archeological deposits shallowly
buried and concentrated at 40 centimeters below the surface. Hearth features,
charcoal and associated projectile points were collected and documented during
the testing phase. Large areas of access road deposits contained evidence of
similar intact, shallowly buried prehistoric materials located adjacent and
parallel to Cooks Slough. With evidence of intact site deposits adjacent to Pole
1/5 and within the construction access road, Hicks & Company recommended
mitigation excavations to preserve archeological data along these two potentially
sensitive portions of the upgrade corridor.

Research Design and Field Methodology

5.0 RESEARCH DESIGN AND FIELD METHODOLOGY
5.1

INTRODUCTION
Limited test excavations at Site 41UV68 demonstrated the presence of a
relatively intact series of Transitional Archaic to Late Prehistoric occupations in
the area of Pole 1/5 and Test Unit 2 at the site, and in three of the four test
units excavated in the dirt two track road. Four AMS radiocarbon ages collected
from in-situ feature focused charcoal in Test Unit 2 span approximately 600
years of prehistoric occupation.
Calibrated radiocarbon ages span from
approximately A.D. 410-1050 (1500-1000 B.P.). Two calibrated dates (95%
probability) from separate sediment stains in association with the bottom edge of
a burned rock cluster are virtually identical in Level 4 at 1560 and 1520 +/- 40
B.P. (Beta 197195, 196). Higher in the profile, two additional dates nearly
overlap in Level 2 at approximately 1000 B.P. (Beta 197193, 194). Testing
demonstrated the presence of intact features, significant organic preservation,
the presence of diagnostic artifacts and a significant lithic assemblage. Testing
demonstrated these materials to be intact, in context, well preserved and
established a Transitional Archaic/Late Prehistoric time frame based on AMS
radiocarbon dating. It was unclear from the testing whether these materials
represent a consistent and homogenous zone of Transitional-Late Prehistoric
occupations or exhibited even finer vertical and spatial stratification. Such
stratification, if present, might provide limited but important archeological data
on the cultural ecology of the Transitional Archaic Interval, the Late Prehistoric
Interval, or the transition between. Due to its restricted nature, the targeted
testing strategy also did not resolve the possible presence of older, intact buried
occupations at the site.

5.2

TARGETED QUESTIONS
Within a cultural ecological approach to the interpretation of prehistoric huntergatherer behavior, a research design for the targeted mitigation of proposed
impacts to Site 41UV68 may address a limited number of important research
issues. The degree to which these issues can be addressed will depend upon the
sample size of mitigation areas relative to the information value of the total site
deposits. Based on the testing data, two targeted questions might be addressed
through the data recovery of a sufficient sample size of the total archeological
deposits at the site. These targeted questions may provide limited but important
data relevant to site interpretation and its relation to the archeological record of
west-central Texas. Caution must be emphasized because the mitigation is
restricted to impacted areas and these are peripheral to the deepest and best
preserved archeological deposits at the site. Thus, no site-specific significant
hypotheses relating to the west central Texas archeological record can or should
be addressed. Similarly, the exploration and documentation of unique site
aspects or those possibly exploring data gaps in the regional record cannot be
adequately addressed based on mitigation of limited impact areas. Nor should
the information recovered on important site aspects be considered the final
documentation on particular site issues. Two important research issues might
be addressed through the targeted recovery of excavation data using the
proposed specific methods.

Archeological Mitigation – UV68 – July 2007

15

Research Design and Field Methodology

Targeted questions include:
Are there older intact, well-preserved prehistoric occupations
at the site in the deeper silty sediment zones?
What is the overall site chronology and data potential of each
of the intact prehistoric occupation zones?

5.3

METHODS
Mitigation zones are confined to the unexcavated immediate impact zones of Pole
1/5 and the dirt two-track road extending from the creek generally to the
northwest at the site. A single steel pole will replace existing the wooden Hframes at Pole 1/5. The foundation diameter for the steel pole is 6.5 feet. The
location of Pole 1/5 has been slightly offset from the existing structure. Impacts
from pole replacements will be limited to this diameter at the offset location. An
additional total of two cubic meters of hand excavated sediments in the form of
an additional 1 x 2 meter hand excavation unit is proposed at the pole
replacement location for Pole 1/5. Testing resulted in the recovery of significant
information from a 1 x 2 unit at the pole location and one additional 1 x 2 at
this location, with concomitant analysis, will mitigate the impacts in this small
area. This unit will be excavated to cultural sterility presumed from testing data
to be no more than one meter in depth.
Additional site impacts may result from vehicular traffic along the existing twotrack roadway. First, a small mechanical bobcat with a bucket no more than
1.5 feet wide will excavate a trench down the center of the dirt road from the
edge of the slough floodplain to immediately south of Test Unit 7 (approximately
240 meters). On average, this trench will reach a maximum depth of 50
centimeters through its full length. The small bobcat will be minimally invasive
compared to larger machines and possible vehicular road disturbance. The
trench will unearth approximately 60 cubic meters of dirt and expose sensitive
archeological deposits such as features or activity areas, and/or additional
disturbed portions and allow the placement of targeted hand excavations in
these locations. A total of 12 cubic meters of additional hand excavations in the
form of three 2 x 2 meter or comparable units excavated to a maximum of one
meter in depth at strategic locations are proposed for mitigation purposes in the
dirt two-track roadway. The trench (8.3%) and the 12 cubic meters (1.6%) are
estimated to represent approximately 9.9% of the total intact road archeological
deposits. A total of 9.9% represents a statistically significant sample of the total
intact road deposits, within the area of possible roadway impacts. Thus, a total
of 14 cubic meters of hand-excavated sediments with concomitant analysis are
proposed to mitigate planned site impacts. Less than 14 cubic meters of hand
excavated sediments, or 60 cubic meters of mechanically removed roadway
sediments, may be excavated if test units or portions of the roadway
demonstrate cultural sterility and/or disturbed sediments.
Units of a 1 x 2 or 2 x 2 meter size (as opposed to 1 x 1) will enable a larger
sample size and more successful interpretation of the horizontal and vertical
distributional patterning observed within specific occupation zones (more of a
broad horizontal approach within a sampling strategy), and more efficient
documentation of hearth features. Each hand excavation unit will be subject to
careful provenienced excavations, mapping and recording. Emphasis will be
placed on the recording of features and burned limestone rocks according to

Archeological Mitigation – UV68 – July 2007

16

pre-established criteria. Recorded rock attributes will include size, fracture
patterns and any evident organizational patterning. Emphasis will be placed on
the relational piece plotting of all archeological artifacts, including faunal
remains, mussel, bone, charcoal and any other organic materials.
Plan views will be drawn and units photographed at the top and bottom of each
arbitrary 10 centimeter level and in the case of intact archeological surface
remnants, and/or hearth features.
Excavations will proceed through the
vertical depth of the cultural deposits. A control sample of sediment for flotation
analysis will be collected from a 20 x 20 centimeter area from each 10
centimeter level. Any anomaly in patterning will be identified as a feature. All
features in units will be excavated. Features will be studied in plan view and in
profile, drawn and photographed.
Sediment for flotation matrix and for
radiocarbon dating will be extracted from all identified hearth features. All
charcoal samples and organic materials will be piece plotted and collected. All
sediments will be screened through ¼-inch mesh and all chert, organic and
faunal artifacts collected. Any encountered burned rock midden deposits will be
excavated through to achieve a sample of internal stratigraphy and matrix
constituents. A geomorphic study of site sediments and formation processes will
be undertaken utilizing trench and hand units profiles.

5.4

ANALYSIS AND REPORTING
A contextual analysis will be conducted of the documented cultural materials.
The analysis will focus on the piece plotting information of identified materials
(cultural and natural), the drawings and photographs of plan view slices through
the deposits, and also relationally to the distributional patterning of organic
materials and observed features, and will be considered within the established
geomorphic context. The following analyses will be conducted on collected
material: radiocarbon dating of charcoal and sediment samples (chronology);
faunal/molluscan identification (subsistence), diagnostic artifact analyses and
identification (chronology/technology), lithics analyses (site type/technology),
flotation matrix water screening (subsistence) and macrobotanical analyses of
recovered organics. Sediment dating may not be employed if there are sufficient
charcoal samples from feature contexts to establish site chronology (C-14 dates).
These analyses will be combined with a geomorphic study of the contextual
integrity and evolution/age of terrace sediments to complete the limited
mitigation investigations.
All data recovery work will be conducted under a Texas Antiquities Code Permit
(TAC), which will have been obtained prior to the commencement of fieldwork.
The results of the survey will be compiled into an interim letter report submittal.
The interim report will be submitted to AEP, to LCRA and the THC for initial
review and comment. The reports will summarize the field investigations and
make regulatory recommendations. Following regulatory review of the interim
report, the results of the field investigations will be compiled into a detailed, final
technical report. The review draft of the technical report will be submitted for
regulatory review and all comments addressed. The report will be revised
according to THC comment and 20 copies of the final technical report submitted
to the THC. Two copies of the final report will be submitted to the LCRA. All
project related artifacts (with landowner permission) and original field
documents will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory

(TARL). Submittal of the 20 THC copies and formal curation will complete the
requirements of the TAC Permit.

GEOMORPHOLOGY
6.1

INTRODUCTION AND GEOMORPHIC SETTING
Site 41UV68 is located in the northern Nueces River drainage basin, part of the
West Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic region (Fenneman 1946; Bureau of
Economic Geology 1996). The site occupies the lower valley wall/colluvial slope
and flood terrace of Cooks Slough, an intermittent tributary of the Leona River,
on the Slough’s right (western) bank (Geological Survey 1971). Cooks Slough
conveys runoff from the steep Balcones Escarpment, draining generally
southward, then southeastward into the Leona River.
Cretaceous strata
exposed along the Escarpment include hard limestones, cherts, and marls
(Brown et al. 1983). These strata are the sources of abundant gravel and silt,
which were transported by ancient river and stream systems and deposited
along the base of the Escarpment. Gravel deposits of apparent Pliocene age are
known as the Uvalde Formation. The Leona Formation consists of Pleistocene
silt and gravel deposits. Cooks Slough and other modern streams crossing the
Escarpment have eroded into these formations and redeposited the sediment on
their flood terraces, flood plains, and channels. An unmapped remnant of the
Uvalde Formation is exposed just northwest of Site 41UV68 and the Leona
Formation underlies part of the site directly. With an overall slope gradient of
10% to the northeast, the site has been buried beneath a veneer of Holocene
slope-wash deposits and overbank deposits associated with flooding of Cooks
Slough, located just to the east.

Stratum 1 is a late Holocene-modern slope-wash deposit that may reflect
enhanced erosion and local deposition as a result of intensified land use during
the Late Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries. Stratum 2 is an anthrosol,
representing a mixture of slope-wash and overbank deposits heavily modified by
prehistoric activities at the site. Many of the hearths were discovered within or
immediately overlying Stratum 3, which is also a mixed overbank and slopewash deposit, but was less intensively modified during site occupation. Strata 4
and 5 are the Pleistocene Leona Formation, which is pre-cultural. Properties of
these strata vary across the site, but the profiles exposed in the pits appear to
be correlative. This indicates that the site is continuous across the landform.
Buried hearth features are well preserved and yielded charcoal for radiocarbon

assays, as well as time-diagnostic artifacts. The cultural deposits are late
Holocene in age. Some artifacts were recovered from the upper few centimeters
of Stratum 4, but they are clearly intrusive.

6.3

CULTURAL RESOURCE POTENTIAL
Despite the shallow depth of burial, Site 41UV68 appears to be well preserved
and to have significant potential for data recovery.
The presence of
stratigraphically coherent cultural materials and intact hearths with organic
remains presents opportunities for assessing prehistoric lifeways within a
constrained chronologic framework. Agreement of the chronologies afforded by
the radiocarbon samples and diagnostic artifacts would confirm this preliminary
conclusion. Additional studies at this site are warranted.

7.0 RESULTS OF FIELD INVESTIGATIONS
7.1

SITE ORGANIZATION
Site 41UV68 is located along Cooks Slough in central southern Uvalde County,
central Texas, near the City of Uvalde (Figure 1). While elements of the site
have been recorded on both the eastern and western banks of the Slough, the
most intact elements occupy a gradual northwest-ward rising hillslope that
follows the Slough along its western bank (see Previous Investigations and
Figure 5). The single two-track ranch road that was the primary focus of
mitigation excavations marks the only generally cleared portion of the site area
with the rest moderately populated with lush, low mesquites, cactus and tall
grasses (Figure 6). The site is situated in a moderately vegetated open
grazeland populated with mesquites, short grasses and a small herd of cattle. In
the densest portions of the site, the landscape is traversed by a series of three
overhead “H” frame transmission lines that emanate from the Uvalde Substation
to the south. These lines generally intersect immediately north and west of the
Slough then proceed on to Del Rio and other, unknown locations. Visibility
across the surface of the site is moderate to low (20-40%) with predictably better
visibility along the two-track road (60+%). Erosional/depositional regimes at
41UV68 have produced a somewhat narrow band of intact archeological deposits
midway down the hillslope between the hill top at the northwestern terminus
and the Slough at the southeastern. Archeological materials within this portion
of the site are generally isolated to the upper 70 centimeters with particularly
dense and moderately overprinted occupational surfaces found between 20 and
50 centimeters below the ground surface (see Chapter 6 for detailed discussion
of soils and their implications within this area).
Thirteen backhoe trenches were dug down the center of the two-track ranch
maintenance road. The first nine trenches (Trenches 1-9) were excavated
contiguously from north to south down the roadway through the most intact
and deepest sediments of the site while the remaining four trenches (Trenches
10-13) were spaced several meters apart along the road, terminating
approximately 30 meters north of Cooks Slough (Figures 5 and 6). All of the
backhoe trenches were excavated to provide a geomorphic profile of the landform
and to isolate features for more detailed test unit excavations. Including testing
excavations, a total of 13 1 x 2 and 2 x 2 meter test units (seven 1 x 2s during
Testing and six 1 x 2s and 2 x 2s in data recovery) were excavated in the Site
41UV68 investigations. While testing excavations focused on potential impacts
related to transmission line pole placement and the assessment of the
maintenance ranch road for archeological potential, mitigation operations
focused on intact features unearthed during trench excavations. A single 1 x 2
meter test unit (Unit 13) was dug at a proposed revised transmission line pole
(Pole 1/5).
Below is a discussion of each stage of mitigation excavations beginning with a
detailed account of findings from trenching followed by details of the subsequent
test unit investigations.

TRENCH INVESTIGATIONS
As per the research design, trenching began adjacent to Test Unit 7 of the
testing phase at the northern section of the dirt two-track roadway, northwest of
Pole 1/5 (Figure 5). The backhoe was centered over the road and removed
sediment in thin scrapings carefully monitored at all times by 1-2 archeologists.
It quickly became apparent during the first 60 meters of trenching that this
would be tedious process. With the small bucket (18 inches wide) only small
amounts of dirt could be removed with each scrape and the backhoe could only
excavate three- to four-meter lengths per scrape, before moving on to the next
position. Also, burned rock features tended to be small, relatively discrete
clusters that were readily observed and better exposed in plan view rather than
in profile. As per the research design, the average depth of the trench was 50-60
centimeters, well below the brown, silty, B horizon clays and penetrating into
yellow, Pleistocene-age sterile sands, and/or gravels. Representative samples of
the upper cultural bearing zones were screened through ¼ inch wire mesh and
all quarter sized or larger chert artifacts collected. The backhoe was stopped
with the appearance of any rock or stain anomalies and these were investigated
in plan view. Rock patterns or stains identified as features were left in place for
later recording and possible excavation.
Centered over and responding to bends in the road, the backhoe excavated a
series of nine contiguous trenches (Trenches 1-9) and four non-contiguous
trenches (Trenches 10-13) to variable depths depending upon cultural recovery
and depth of gravels or sand (Figures 5 and 7). Trenches were numbered and
terminated at angles to correspond to bends in the dirt two-track road. These
proceeded south, along the dirt road, down the topography of the landform, past
Pole 1/5 located to the north and into the lower elevations of the site (Figures 5
and 7). The trench was approximately 135 meters in total length through
Trench 9. Four additional non-contiguous trenches were excavated in the

center of the road further south towards the slough revealing thin, disturbed
sediments overlying dense channel gravels (Trenches 10-13; Figure 8). These
latter were completely disturbed. Trenching clearly established the cultural
bearing sediment zones within the roadway as opposed to the lower channel
gravel deposits of Cooks Slough.

features).

Contiguous Backhoe Trench Facing Cooks Slough (note flagged

Hundreds of artifacts were unearthed by the backhoe in Trenches 1-9, many of
these within the clearly disturbed friable slopewash zone of 10-15 centimeters
below the surface (AC). Below this, a thin grayish brown silty-clay A-horizon
(Ab1) graded into a strong brown B horizon silty-clay (Bwb1) extending to
variable depths averaging 20-60 centimeters in vertical extent throughout the
length of the trench. Cultural materials were present throughout but intact only
in the B horizon in the northern portion of the trenches. This situation reversed
in the southern portion of the trench, where the thin A horizon (20-30 cms)
contained intact, very well preserved features, and the B horizon intergraded
with extensive channel oriented gravel deposits.

Results of Field Investigations

Figure 8: Extensive Gravels within Contiguous Trench 12.

A total of approximately 19 rock clusters and/or stained areas were investigated
as possible features throughout the length of the contiguous trench (Figure 9).
Sixteen of these were formally designated as possible prehistoric hearth features
for further recording and investigation. A number of features were identified at
the transition between the A and B horizons, generally between 20-40
centimeters below surface. One was immediately identified at the northern
testing phase Test Unit 7 location in Trench 1 (Feature 18, Figures 9 and 10).
This appeared to be an extension of the disturbed slopewash or slump related
midden-like feature identified at this location during testing, and was not
subject to further investigation. A second cluster in Trench 3 was observed 50­
60 centimeters below the surface at the bottom of the B horizon, overlying yellow
sands (2Bwb2, Feature 4, Figures 9 and 10). This cluster suggested the
possibility of older materials within the cultural B horizon zone and was marked
for further investigations. Overall, the B horizon silty-clays contained a dense,
artifact rich zone of cultural occupations evident throughout Trenches 1-6. The
B zone directly overlay the lower zone of Pleistocene Leona silts. Feature 4 was
unique in that it was the only rock cluster identified at the contact point
between the lower B horizon and the lower ancient silts.

Figure 10: Typical Site Soil Profiles as Observed in Trenches 3, 5 and 8.

To the south and downslope of Feature 4, Trenches 3-6 exhibited a consistent
dense lens of burned rocks and flakes at 20-30 centimeters below the surface,
below the disturbed, friable slopewash zone. This zone contained a very high
density of cultural materials extending through the A horizon (Ab1), well into the
lower B horizon (Bwb1) and decreasing with depth into the underlying Leona
formation silts. Fully nine separate areas or rock clusters were identified as
“very” high density for cultural materials within this zone extending from
Trenches 3-6, from the eastern end of Trench 3 (Features 5, 10-17, Figures 9
and 10). These features were identified on the basis of noticeably high densities
of chert and limestone rocks within the generally high density of other materials
observed within the A/B sediments, throughout the length of these trenches.
The majority of these features were identified at the contact point between the A
and B horizons. This positioning of these features was consistent with the high
density lens of materials observed from approximately 20-30 centimeters for the
length of Trenches 3-6.
Further south, Trenches 7-9 contained an extremely well preserved set of hearth
features with good organic preservation in the A horizon of the site overlying a
thinning B Horizon and exposures of extensive gravels with increasing proximity
to the slough (Features 6-9, Figures 9 and 10). Features in Trenches 7-9
consisted of a series of better preserved, small basined pits and burned rock
clusters containing medium and large sized rocks. The clusters were positioned
high in the A profile and were mixed with natural river gravels through many
Archeological Mitigation – UV68 – July 2007

portions of the trenches. Small basined, potentially rockless pits were observed
in the trench profiles.
In contrast to the western site areas of higher
topography, features in the A horizon, closer to the slough, contained readily
observable charcoal and obvious sediment staining. The strong brown B horizon
pinched out midway through Trench 7. The stratigraphy in Trenches 7-9
consisted of the A horizon containing very dense prehistoric cultural materials
directly overlying dense channel gravels and thinning to the east. In the vicinity
of Trench 9, the loose friable slopewash zone of 20-30 centimeters (AC) rested
directly on channel gravels.
A high density of highly disturbed cultural
materials was observed in this slopewash zone. Trenches 10-12 were excavated
at increasing intervals due to the obvious presence of channel gravels reflective
of lateral migration of the slough and represented poor contexts for the
preservation of prehistoric materials (Figure 8).
Indications were that the site is multi-component with well-preserved
Transitional Archaic and Late Prehistoric interval occupations in the A horizon
to the south near the slough, inset and overlying less but still well preserved
Late Archaic materials upslope and parallel to the northern course of Cooks
Slough.
Trench and site stratigraphy consisted of a badly disturbed slopewash zone of
loose, friable sands and silts (AC, typically 10-15 cm), overlying a thin dark
grayish brown A Horizon silty-clay (Ab1, averaging 15-40 cm) grading into a
strong brown silty-clay B horizon to variable depths of 40-60 centimeters below
the surface (Bwb1; Figure 10). The B horizon overlies yellow and grey sands
respectively (2Bwb2, 3Bkb2), which appear to be the ancient, in situ, Pleistocene
Leona formation consisting of highly weathered silty sands containing gravels,
boulders and cemented calcareous nodules. In the southern portion of the
roadway, just north of one bend in the slough, the B horizon is mixed with
extensive dense channel deposits (Trenches 7-12) including very large clasts
packed together indicative of thalweg deposits and/or lateral movement of the
main channel of the slough. B Horizon sediments likely represent the same
lateral and uphill flood deposit that resulted in the channel gravel deposits.
These are overlain by a thin, highly anthropogenic A horizon silty-clays
containing well preserved prehistoric features. B horizon prehistoric features
and occupation zones appear intact but somewhat less well preserved. Older B
horizon hearth features are also of a completely different rock composition than
the higher Late Archaic A horizon materials (chert gravels vs. fractured
limestone, respectively) perhaps indicative of locally available materials during
different time periods, or perhaps indicative of variation in mobility strategies.

TEST UNIT INVESTIGATIONS
Once backhoe trenching had established 19 burned rock and soil stain features
along the access road (Features 4-19), H&C archeologists placed a series of three
1 x 2 (Units 9-11) and two 2 x 2 meter test units (Units 8 and 12; five total) over
those features that were deemed the most intact and of highest potential
significance (Features 4-9). If features were exposed in the base of the backhoe
trench, test units were strung across the trench footprint while those features
observed in the trench profile had units strung out from the edge of the trench
wall (Figure 11). In addition, one 1 x 2 meter test unit (Unit 13) was strung
across the mapped center of the proposed new location of Pole 1/5 (named
Structure 612, Figures 3 and 12), located approximately three meters
northwest of the original Pole 1/5 and two meters northwest of testing phase

Unit 2. Each test unit was excavated to the clear base of cultural deposits
(delineated by sterile sediments or two straight negative unit levels) or the pre­
determined base of impacts, 100 centimeters. While Test Unit 11 terminated 80
centimeters below ground surface, the remaining units were excavated to
between 90 and 100 centimeters below the surface. Taking into account the
approximately one cubic meter of test unit sediments already mechanically
removed from trenching, H&C archeologists hand excavated approximately 13.8
cubic meters (approximately 1.84% of impacted road deposits) of the estimated
14 cubic meters of sediments proposed for site mitigation (approx. 1.87% of road
deposits).

Results of Field Investigations

Each test unit was excavated in arbitrary 10-centimeter levels with the first level
of disturbed, eroded sediments (varying in depth between 10 and 20
centimeters) shoveled quickly for more detailed excavation within intact
components below. When possible, all artifacts quarter sized or larger, as well
as all formal tools, were piece-plotted. All sediment or other anomalies were
treated and documented as features for later evaluation. All charcoal in clear
feature contexts and all other organics were collected. Below the first level, a 20
x 20 x 10 centimeter block was removed from an arbitrary unit corner and
bagged as a column sample from each subsequent level to sample for smaller
materials and organics not recovered during hand excavations. In addition,
stained feature-associated sediments and those soils found directly beneath
dense feature clusters were collected in a similar manner for humate and
flotation sampling. All excavated sediments were screened through ¼” wire
mesh and all lithic debitage, formal tools and bone were collected for further
analysis back at the laboratory. All burned rock was separated into rock type
and size class then counted and weighed. The beginning/end of each unit level
was hand drawn and photographed. Feature profiles were also drawn and
photographed. Below is a brief summary of these excavations and a summary of
the collected data sets.
7.3.1

Road Test Units
Unit 8
Unit 8 was a 2 x 2 meter square that was excavated in order to better
contextualize a cluster of burned limestone and chert identified in Trench 3 as
Feature 4 during trenching (Figures 5 and 13). Unit 8 was oriented so that the
western edge of the unit extends approximately 10-15 centimeters beyond the
western side of Trench 3 and the eastern side of the unit extends approximately
125 centimeters beyond the eastern trench wall. Elevation in the unit was
established using a unit datum – Datum 18 – that was set flush with the ground
surface on the higher western side of the unit. The unit was excavated using a
pick, shovel and trowel in nine arbitrary levels from an elevation of 0 centimeters
below datum (101.953) to 97 centimeters below datum (100.983) at which point
sterile ancient soils had been encountered for over 20 centimeters (Figure 14).
The excavations indicated the presence of a zone of occupation in the A and top
of the B horizon associated with two burned rock features (Features 21 and 4).
The stratigraphy of Unit 8 was divided into three strata based on differences in
the sediments (Figure 13; Table 1). The upper stratum – the A horizon –
extended from the surface (0 centimeters below datum/101.953) to a maximum
depth of 50 centimeters below datum (101.453) in the eastern half of Level 4.
The A horizon sediment was a brown (10YR5/3) blocky clay loam that was very
friable. The sediment was fairly compact, especially in the center and northwest
portions of the unit. There was a content of 10-20% small gravels (0-5 cm in
diameter) and a few rabdotus snail as well as considerable small and medium
sized roots intruding throughout the level. Disturbance and mixing were evident
in the upper 20 centimeters in the form of manganese bleached glass, but the
majority of this stratum was associated with a prehistoric occupation zone and
Feature 21. In Level 4 (40-50 centimeters below datum/101.553-101.453) the A
horizon transitioned to the B horizon deposit, beginning in the western half of
the unit where the B horizon deposit was highest and sloping down to the east.
The B horizon was a deposit of brown (10YR4/3) silty clay with 10% small (0-5
cm) gravels associated with a prehistoric occupation zone and Feature 4. The

Figure 14: Feature Recording in Unit 8.

elevation range of the stratum was 40 centimeters below datum (101.553) in the
western half of Unit 8 to 80 centimeters below datum (101.153) in the
southwestern corner of the unit. Underlying the B horizon was a sterile stratum
of very pale brown compact silty clay (10YR7/4) with a high calcium carbonate
content. This deposit first appeared in the northeastern quadrant of Unit 8 at
58 centimeters below datum (101.373) and sloped down to the southwest. At
the point of termination of the unit excavation (100.983), the bottom of this
stratum had not been reached.
Below twenty centimeters of disturbed soil, trends in the recovery of burned rock
and debitage indicated that Unit 8 had a clear zone of occupation that spanned
Levels 2-7 but was the most dense in Level 4 at the point of transition to the B
Horizon stratum (Table 1). The upper twenty centimeters of disturbed material
were excavated as Level 1 (0-20 cmbd/101.953-101.753) and stratigraphically
was the uppermost portion of the A horizon stratum. In this level 22 pounds of
chert and limestone rock were recovered along with 178 pieces (1064.6 g) of
lithic debitage. No patterning was observed in the rock and this zone likely
represents a combination of a late site occupation mixed with colluvially
redeposited materials. It is interesting to note that the only mussel shell
recovered on site was from this context. In Levels 2 and 3 (20-40 centimeters
below datum/101.753-101.553), recovery of chert and limestone rocks

Archeological Mitigation – UV68 – July 2007

Results of Field Investigations

continued, but slowly decreased with five pounds in Level 2 and slightly more
than seven pounds in Level 3 (Table 1). Debitage followed a similar decline in
Level 2 to 117 pieces (409.8 g), but increased again in Level 3 to 148 pieces
(814.7 g). The highest density of material culture from intact deposits was
encountered in Level 4, the transitional zone between the A and B horizons. In
Level 4 the amount of limestone and chert rocks peaked at 10 pounds, and
while debitage decreased in weight to 658.8 grams, it increased in terms of
actual pieces to 173. This level corresponds with Features 21 and 4, the
remnants of two burned rock hearth features. This occupation zone continued
into the B horizon deposits in Level 5 at 50 centimeters below datum (101.453)
and continued to be associated with Feature 4. In Level 5 the recovery of rock
continued but was significantly less at 3.5 pounds. The recovery of rock
dropped consistently through Level 7 before disappearing completely with a shift
in sediments at 80 centimeters below datum (101.153) in Level 8. A similar
trend is seen in the recovery of debitage, which was remained relatively high at
118 pieces (658.9 g) in Level 5, but dropped off quickly through Level 7 to only
13 pieces (40.2 g). Only a negligible amount – 4 pieces (2.4 g) – was recovered
from Levels 8 and 9, likely as a result of bioturbation.
The higher rock and debitage recovery in Levels 3-5 coincided with the primary
elevations of Features 21 and 4. Both features overlapped in elevation at the
point of transition from the A to the B horizon. Feature 21, situated at the
bottom of the A horizon, referred to a cluster of 43 chert and limestone rocks
approximately one meter in length east-west and a ½ meter wide north-south
with an elevation range of 36-55 centimeters below datum (101.583-101.453).
Other rocks including a very large limestone cobble were originally mapped and
excavated as a part of Feature 21 in Levels 2-4. Subsequent analysis of the data,
however, does not support the clear association of these rocks with Feature 21,
but rather their inclusion as material associated with the larger occupation
zone. Including these additional rocks, the total rock weight for Feature 21 was
40 pounds. A radiometric date obtained from Sediment Sample 80 taken from
beneath the very large limestone cobble at 38-40 centimeters below datum
(101.573-101.553) provided a 2-sigma calibrated date of 1170-970 B.P. (Beta
212460; Table 2). This date situates the upper portions of the A horizon
occupation zone in the Transitional Archaic or Late Prehistoric period (Collins
2004:113). A humate sample date (85) from the eastern half of Feature 21
returned a 2-sigma calibrated date of 2140-1930 B.P. (Beta 212461). This
deeper humate sample potentially dates both the feature fill and the top of the
underlying B-horizon. This date may potentially be too young due to infiltration
of ground water and contamination of the sample. Feature 4, situated in the B
horizon, was the remnant of a small, oval cluster of 26 limestone and chert
cobbles that is open on the western side and was 75 centimeters in length
north-south and 65 centimeters in width east-west. The elevation of the tops of
the rocks ranged between 42 and 56 centimeters below datum (101.533­
101.423). Like Feature 21, there was a large quantity of rock surrounding the
feature focus, but in unclear association. The total combined weight of rock in
Levels 5 and 6 excavated associated with Feature 4 was 24.5 pounds. A
radiocarbon date from charcoal sample 52, collected in the B horizon in Level 5
25 centimeters to the north of Feature 4 at an elevation of 54 centimeters below
datum (101.443), returned a 2-sigma calibrated date of 3340-3070 B.P. (Beta
212458). This date corresponds to a Late Archaic I date (Collins 2004:113).
Sampling of Unit 8 included eight column samples, three humate samples, two
sediment samples and three C-14 samples (Table 2). Column samples were
collected from the southeast corner of all levels but Level 1 and measured 20 x

20 x 10 centimeters. Two humate samples - 80 and 85 – and one Sediment
Sample (Sample 86) were collected from Feature 21 contexts. As described
above, both of the humate samples were radiometrically dated. A bulk matrix
sample (96) and a humate sample (95) were collected from Feature 4. Three
charcoal samples were collected, one from Level 2 (C-14 Sample 50) and two
from Level 5 (C-14 Samples 52 and 54). Only one charcoal sample (Sample 52)
was dated as described earlier. The results of the column samples and the bulk
matrix samples indicated the presence of unburned mesquite and indeterminate
tree wood as well as modern root and insect material (Appendix E).
Lithic tools were recovered from Levels 1-6 in the A and B Horizons (Table 3).
The artifacts from Level 1 (0-20 centimeters below datum/101.953-101.753)
included a Stage 1 biface (Unique Item 195-2), a Stage 4 biface fragment (Unique
Item 195-1), three unifaces (Unique Items 195-3, 195-4, 195-5), a bi-directional
core (Unique Item 195-6), 14 use wear and retouched flake tools (Unique Items
195-8-195-21) and a battered limestone cobble (Unique Item 195-7). In Levels 2­
4 (20-50 centimeters below datum/101.753-101.453) two projectile points
(Unique Item 213-1, 229-1), six bifaces or biface fragments (Unique Items 204-1,
204-2, 204-4, 204-5, 213-2, 229-2), one uniface (Unique Item 204-3), one
retouched flake (Unique Item 204-7), two use wear flakes (Unique Items 229-5,
229-6), and six cores (Unique Items 204-6, 213-3, 213-4, 213-5, 229-3, 229-4)
were recovered in association with Features 21 and 4 (Table 3). The first
projectile point (Unique Item 213-1) was recovered in the northeast corner (N199
E199) of the unit at an elevation of 32 centimeters below datum (101.633) in A
horizon matrix near clusters of limestone and chert likely associated with
Feature 21. This projectile point is classified as a Nolan point, a style typically
associated with Middle Archaic occupations in central Texas. The second
projectile point was recovered in B horizon matrix 15 centimeters north of
Feature 4 in Level 4 at an elevation of 47 centimeters below the surface
(101.483). Six additional tools were recovered in B horizon contexts in general
association with Feature 4 in Levels 5 and 6 (40-70 centimeters below
datum/101.553-101.253; Table 3). The tools recovered included a Stage 1 and a
Stage 2 biface (Unique Items 254-1, 254-4, and four cores (Unique Items 242-2,
242-2, 254-2, 254-3). No tools were found below Level 6.
In summary, Unit 8 was excavated through a relatively stratified deposit of
archeological materials that potentially spanned a period from B.P. 3340 to B.P.
1170 or later. Within Unit 8 there was a clear occupation zone through the A
horizon and the upper B horizon. The upper 20 centimeters below datum
(101.953-101.753) of the A horizon is best described as an unstructured
assortment of burned rock, debitage, tools, mussel shell and historic glass that
appears significantly disturbed. This zone was undated, but may pertain to the
later Austin Phase components of the site mixed with earlier colluvially
redeposited materials. The occupation zone was densest in Levels 3-5 (30-60
centimeters below datum/101.553-101.353) and was associated with two rock
cluster features that appear to be the remnants of hearths. The upper portion of
the zone was in the A horizon deposit and was associated with Feature 21. The
lower portion was in the B horizon and associated with Feature 4. The two
features were spatially discrete, but overlapped slightly in their elevation ranges
at the interface between the A and B horizons, and artifact recovery within these
three levels was fairly consistent. Radiometric dating of humate samples and
charcoal from this zone suggest it represents a period of use as long as 2000
years. The long time interval suggested by the radiometric dates and the lack of
clear internal stratification suggest this zone was composed of a series of
compressed and overprinted occupational episodes.

Unit 9
Test Unit 9 was opened in Backhoe Trench 5 to investigate Feature 5, a cluster
of burned limestone and chert identified during the trenching operations
(Figures 5 and 15). Unit 9 was a 1 x 2 meter excavation unit with the long axis
oriented roughly east-west. Elevation was established with the use of a unit
datum – Datum 19 - set flush with the surface on the western side of the unit.
The unit was excavated with a pick, shovel and trowel in ten 10 centimeter
arbitrary levels. The excavation of Unit 9 identified an occupational zone located
in the A horizon from 10-40 centimeters below datum (101.525-101.325)
associated with a single hearth, Feature 20.
During the excavations, stratigraphic zones associated with three different soil
horizons were identified between 0-100 centimeters below datum (Figure 15;
Table 4). The upper zone was the A horizon located between 0 and 40
centimeters below datum (101.725-101.325) in Levels 1-4. The surface and
upper ten centimeters were clearly disturbed by recent site activities and
erosion, though a significant quantity of cultural material was recovered. These
upper sediments were described as 10YR5/3 brown and friable silty clay loam.
Below Level 1 the deposit was noted as more compact, presumably as a result of
less recent disturbance, though Level 2 (10-20 centimeters below
datum/101.525-101.425) had considerable root disturbance. In Levels 3 and 4
(20-40 centimeters below datum/101.425-101.225) there was a slight color shift
in the matrix to 10YR4/3. Root disturbance decreased in these levels. At the
base of Level 4, excavators marked a transition to the B horizon (10YR4/3.5).
This transition was higher in the western half of the unit (33 centimeters below
datum/101.395) than the eastern half (37 centimeters below datum/101.355)
suggesting the buried surface sloped slightly down to the slough. The B horizon
sediment is dark yellowish brown (10YR4/3.5) silty clay with 30% content of
gravels. In the eastern half of Unit 9 the base of the B horizon was shallower,

ending around 50 centimeters below datum (101.255), but the B horizon
continued to approximately 80 centimeters below datum (101.025) in the
western half of the unit. The deposit underlying the B horizon was a 7.5YR7/6
(reddish yellow) or 5YR8/2 (pinkish white) soil, that was silty and clayier at the
top becoming sandier with depth. By 80 centimeters below datum (100.925) this
ancient soil predominated across Unit 9, but apparent rodent burrows and root
intrusion had introduced small quantities of debitage into what were otherwise
culturally sterile soils.
Limestone and chert rocks were recovered in all levels but Levels 8 and 10, but
recovery was highest in the A horizon in Levels 2 through 4 (10-40 centimeters
below datum/101.625-101.325; Table 4). In many cases rocks were clearly
burned, but not all exhibited conclusive evidence of extensive thermal alteration.
Rock recovery was low in Level 1, with just under one half of a pound recovered.
This was followed by a significant jump in Level 2 in which nine pounds of
limestone and chert were recovered. In Levels 3 and 4, the same levels in which
the Features 5 and 20 were identified, the amount of stone recovered jumped to
57 and 20 pounds respectively with the clear occupational zone isolated to the
upper of the two levels. The transition to the B horizon deposits in Level 5 was
marked by a sudden decrease in the recovery of stone. In Level 5 only three-

quarters of a pound were recorded. One and a half pounds were recovered in
Level 6, and three-quarters of a pound were weighed and recorded in Level 7.
After Level 7 and the shift to the more ancient sediments, burned rock is nearly
non-existent with only a half of a pound found in Level 9 and none in either
Level 8 or 10.
The recovery of debitage mirrored the recovery patterns of the limestone and
chert. In general, artifact densities were highest in the A horizon, peaking in
Levels 2 through 4 (Table 4). Debitage in Level 1 only amounted to a total
weight of 73 pieces for 274.1 grams, though this level was not excavated in its
entirety across the unit because surface slope meant that only five centimeters
were excavated from the eastern half. Debitage recovery more than doubled in
Level 2 (10-20 centimeters below datum/101.625-101.525) to 234 pieces/483
grams and increased again to 277 pieces (705.6 g) in Level 3 (20-30 centimeters
below datum/101.525-101.425) before declining again in weight 164.3 grams for
131 pieces in Level 4 (30-40 centimeters below datum/101.425-101.325). In
Level 5 (40-50 centimeters below datum/101.425-101.325), the point of full
transition into the B horizon deposit, debitage recovery dropped dramatically to
only 25 pieces weighing 152.3 grams. It dropped slowly in Levels 6 and 7 before
rising slightly again to 18 pieces (84.4 g) in Level 8 (70-80 centimeters below
datum/101.025-100.925), the point of transition to ancient sediments. Below
Level 8 there was a small recovery of debitage, seven pieces (47.5 g) in Level 9
and eight pieces weighing only 5.1 grams in Level 10, but in these levels the
artifact recovery was clearly associated with areas of disturbance (Figure 15)
and was considered to be present as a result of downward migration of artifacts,
not as a result of human depositional activity.
The two features identified in this unit were both recorded in Levels 3 and 4
within the A horizon occupation zone and correspond to the zone of highest
density of rock and debitage.
As originally recorded, Feature 5 was an
amorphous cluster of approximately 25 small to medium chert and limestone
cobbles that was first identified during the trenching of the site at an elevation of
23 centimeters below datum (101.495). Subsequent examination of the feature
indicated that the elements identified in the trench were part of a higher density
scatter of stone associated with an occupation surface, not a feature
representative of a particular aspect of site furniture such as a hearth (Figure
15: Level 3). The total weight of stone recovered as Feature 5 was 46 pounds.
In the northeastern corner of Unit 9, however, a tighter cluster of 43 large to
small limestone and chert rocks was designated Feature 20. Feature 20 was 60
x 60 centimeters in horizontal plan with an elevation that ranged from 24-37
centimeters below datum (101.485-101.355). The feature consisted of one
principal layer of large and small limestone and chert rock, some clearly burned,
resting on the interface between the A and B horizons. Some additional stone
was recovered adjacent to the central portion of the feature and in an associated
area of staining, but this material was not in clear association. Including this
additional stone, the total Feature 20 rock weight is 16.5 pounds. Based on the
shape and lack of evidence for a pit, Feature 20 is interpreted as a small surface
hearth.
Column samples were consistently collected in all levels but Level 1 where
disturbance was clearly present (Table 5). Column samples were all 20 x 20 x
10 centimeters in size and were collected from the southeast corner of the unit.
Owing to the natural soil stratigraphy, column samples below Level 5 were taken
from underlying sterile sediments and contained no significant material. The

column samples from Levels 2 through 5 contained modern roots, grass seeds,
mesquite leaves, and two seeds of Mollugo and some insect parts, but no
charcoal. In addition to the column samples, a humate (Sediment Sample 43)
and a bulk sediment sample (Sediment Sample 44) were collected from the
central focus of Feature 20 in Level 4. The analysis of the floated bulk sample
indicated the presence of roots and insect parts, but no identifiable plant
remains were recorded. The humate sample was submitted to Beta Analytic for
dating and returned a 2-sigma calibrated radiocarbon age of 1570-1410 B.P.
(Beta 212455). A single charcoal Sample (C-14 Sample 37) was collected from a
large area of charcoal in the south central portion of Unit 9 at an elevation of 23­
30 centimeters below datum (101.495-101.425). A portion of the sample was
sent to Beta Analytic for AMS dating and returned a 2-sigma calibrated
radiocarbon date of 1720-1540 B.P. (Beta 212453). Another portion of the
sample was sent to Phil Dering for identification (See Appendix E). The charcoal
was identified as pieces of mesquite root. These two dates strongly suggest that

the lower portions of the A horizon are Late Archaic II/Transitional Archaic in
date.
The recovery of formal tool types was restricted to the upper A horizon deposits
with the exception of a single unidirectional core (Unique Item 173-1) found in
Level 7 (60-70 cmbd/101.125-101.025) near the base of the B horizon
occupation (Table 6). From Level 2 (10-20 cmbd/101.625-101.525) a retouched
flake (Unique Item 127-1) and two use wear flakes (Unique Items 127-2, 127-3)
were recovered. In Level 3 (20-30 cmbd/101.525-101.425) a Stage 2 biface
(Unique Item 133-1), a Stage 2 biface fragment (Unique Item 133-2), a uniface
(Unique Item 133-3), and a retouched flake (Unique Item 133-4) and a use wear
flake (Unique Item 133-6) were recovered from general level contexts. In Level 4
(30-40 cmbd/101.425-101.325) a bifacial core (Unique Item 139-2) and a piece
of possibly battered stone (Unique Item 139-3) were recovered. The battered
stone is a chert cobble that exhibits some damage on the surface, but it appears
to be natural, not cultural (see Chapter 9). In addition a piece of red ochre was
found on the screen from Level 4. Overall, formal artifacts cluster in the A
horizon in a zone from 20-40 centimeters below datum (101.525-101.325) in the
same levels (Levels 3-4) as the features.
In summary, Unit 9 has three distinct strata with a single occupation zone. The
occupation zone was characterized by a dense concentration of limestone and
chert manuports, debitage, and tools from 20-40 centimeters below datum
(101.525-101.32).
Overlapping 2-sigma radiometric dates from this zone
indicate a possible period of occupation from B.P. 1720-1410, placing the
occupation within the Late Archaic II and possibly the Transitional Archaic
Intervals of Texas prehistory. Within this zone Feature 20 - a cluster of 43 chert
and limestone cobbles - was identified as the remnants of a hearth. This
occupation zone rested on the lower stratigraphic zone, the B horizon, which
had a much lower density of material culture, with only one core recovered in
addition to a small amount of debitage and burned chert and limestone. The
light scatter of debitage and small amounts of burned stone indicate a light
occupation of this portion of the site likely contemporaneous with the B horizon
occupation in Unit 8. However, Unit 9 excavations did not uncover any features
or activity areas in the B horizon, and much of the recovered material may have
been secondarily redeposited as a result of root disturbance and rodent activity
noted in the course of the excavation.
Unit 10
Test Unit 10 was strung off the eastern edge of Backhoe Trench 9, near the
center of the trenched portion of the site (Figures 5 and 16). It was placed to
investigate a possible soil stain and burned rock feature observed in the trench’s
northeast profile (Feature 6). The unit was excavated through nine levels to a
maximum depth of 90 centimeters below datum (100.702). Through these levels
archeologists noted a soil matrix that had been highly disturbed by tree roots.
More extensive elements of Feature 6 were observed during unit excavation,
however root intrusion was too extensive (particularly between 30 and 40
cmbd/101.302-101.202) to provide any valuable archeological data.

Unit 10’s ground surface was noted as covered with loose, scattered small
burned rocks and natural gravels. Like all test units, the first excavation level
was quickly removed with a shovel and not sampled. Modern glass and metal
were observed within the first level. Following this level, a sediment sample was
collected from each level in the southeast unit corner. Through the first four
levels (0-40 cmbd/101.602-101.202), soils within Test Unit 10 were described as
10YR4/2 grayish brown clayey silts and silty clays with minimal gravels (Figure
16; Table 7).
Beginning at the base of Level 3 (30 centimeters below
datum/101.302) and extending through the next 10 centimeters, sediments
gradually transitioned to the lower, B horizon soils. Beginning at the transition,
Unit 10 sediments gradually increased in natural gravel and clay content, first
becoming 10YR4/3 brown then transitioning to the C horizon: a gravelly
10YR5/4 yellowish brown silty clay in the northern 1/3 of the unit and a
10YR8/3 very pale brown clay in the southern 2/3 by base of Level 7 (70
cmbd/100.902). The heavy chert and quartzite gravels continued through to the
base of the unit at 90 centimeters below datum (100.702).
Throughout the soil column, particularly within Levels 2 through 5,
archeologists unearthed a notably dense web of modern/recent-historic tree
roots. Beginning near the base of Level 2 (20 cmbd/101.402) archeologists
noted extensive root intrusions extending through the grid western perimeter of
the unit (Figure 17). With each succeeding level (through the base of Level 4)
the roots expanded to the northern and southern unit boundaries. By Level 5,
the roots occupied most of the test unit area. Many of the roots had fragments
of bark still attached while others bore evidence of fairly recent burning at their
ends (Figure 17). While much less dense beyond the base of Level 5 (50
cmbd/101.102) root intrusions continued through the base of Level 7 (60-70
cmbd/101.002-100.902) before being absent at the base of Level 8. All feature
(Feature 6 – see below) elements within Unit 10 bore varied indications of
disturbance as a result of this root intrusion.

Figure 17: Close up of Root Intrusions from Unit 10 (note ochre adjacent to north
arrow).

Burned rock tallies within Unit 10 gradually increased over the first four levels
(Table 7) reaching a maximum weight of 41 pounds in Level 4, then rapidly
dropped off beyond that point (4.5 lbs in Level 5). This peak level corresponds
with the densest accumulation of Feature 6 burned rocks. Curiously, debitage
weights peaked 20 centimeters higher than the burned rocks, in Level 2 at 473
grams. Levels 3 and 4 (101.402-101.202) decreased gradually from 296 to 230
grams (the levels of the densest Feature 6 inclusion, see below) while the
following levels dropped off sharply with Level 9 being negative for cultural
materials.
Feature 6, initially recorded as a small burned rock and oxidized clay stain
approximately 12-27 centimeters below the surface, was a small, moderately
disturbed scatter of burned rock, oxidized and burned clay and charcoal that
was densest and most cohesive in Level 4. Above this elevation, feature-related
rocks were broadly scattered throughout the test unit with minimal patterning.
Within Level 4, the rocks were more tightly clustered near the center of the unit,
forming a roughly semi-ovate shape approximately 70 x 100 centimeters northsouth x east-west. The cluster bore a general composition and shape indicative
of a disturbed burned rock hearth with charcoal flecks observed within the

densest burned rock scatters. Within this cluster, the top feature rocks had an
upper elevation of approximately 28 centimeters below datum (101.322). The
feature was bisected in an east-west direction through the center of the cluster,
revealing a slight central basin one rock layer thick and a maximum depth of
approximately 37.5 centimeters (101.237). A total of 95 chert and limestone
clasts were recorded within this main feature level. The hearth was observed
resting on the transitional zone between the A and B horizon soils. By the base
of the next level (40-50 cmbd/101.202-101.102) any remnant of the feature had
all but disappeared. Throughout the feature’s vertical and horizontal extent,
there was clear evidence of disturbance from intrusive tree roots (see Feature
Discussions for more detailed descriptions).
With such extensive modern organic disturbance, Test Unit 10 was not
aggressively sampled (Table 8). Aside from the eight column samples collected
from the unit’s southeast corner in Levels 2-9 (Samples 37, 42, 48, 54, 56, 58,
60 and 64), only two sediment samples were collected (Samples 49 and 50).
Samples 49 and 50 were bulk matrix and humate samples (respectively)
collected from beneath Feature 6 rocks during its bisection. Neither sample was
eventually processed.
In addition to the ten total sediment samples,
archeologists also recovered two small charcoal samples within Unit 10’s Level 4
(the densest portions of Feature 6). C-14 Samples 45 and 46 were small
charcoal flecks observed beneath the burned rocks of Feature 6 during the
excavation of its northern bisect. Neither sample was sent away for formal
analysis.
Archeologists noted a single fragment of orange ocher near the eastern portions
of the center of the feature within Level 4 (PP5) at an elevation of 42 centimeters
below datum (101.182; Figure 17).
Formal tools within Unit 10 were relatively limited. Archeologists collected a
total of only nine formal tools in three positive levels (Levels 2-4; Table 9). In
Level 2, archeologists unearthed one multidirectional core (Unique Item 141-1)
and two groundstone fragments (Unique Items 141-2 and 3) near the western
center of the unit, at the Level’s upper face. Three use wear flakes were
recovered within the level as well (Unique Items 141-4-6). A proximal MarcosCastroville projectile point fragment (Unique Item 150-2) was recovered near the
central eastern wall of the unit within Level 3 along with a medium-sized Stage 2
uniface. By Level 4, one thin, Stage 4 proximal biface fragment (Unique Item
164-1) was the only tool to be observed. This tool was the last to be recovered
from within Unit 10 through the remaining five levels.
Overall, Unit 10 was among the more disturbed of the road test units. There
was a clear indication that the feature it contained was intact at some point,
however roots intrusion had effectively removed any context. Even if roots
hadn’t altered the feature makeup, it is clear from the artifact and burned rock
tallies that this was not a significant element of the site with only limited overall
significance.

Results of Field Investigations

Unit 11
Test Unit 11 was strung off the grid west wall of Trench 9 near its southern
terminus (Figures 5 and 18) and was placed to investigate a stained soil and
burned rock feature (Feature 7) exposed in the west wall of the Trench
approximately 80 centimeters below the surface. The 1 x 2 meter test unit was
excavated through seven levels to a maximum depth of 80 centimeters below
Datum 21 (100.616; Figure 18). Citing dense gravels, the lack of artifacts and
pronounced calcium carbonate inclusions (all indications of pre-cultural
sediments), the unit was terminated at this relatively shallow depth. Within the
unit, archeologists excavated an extensive rockless pit and associated burned
rock scatter tentatively associated with the Transitional Archaic Interval
(Feature 7/22).
Unit 11’s ground surface was found to be devoid of intact cultural materials,
rather composed of a very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2) clayey silt with
extensive surface limestone gravels throughout (Table 10).
These soils
continued through the first 20 centimeters of the soil column, with gravels
decreasing in density by the base of Level 1 (0-20 cmbd/101.416-101.216).
10YR3/2 and 10YR4/2 dark grayish brown, relatively rockless silty clays and
clayey silts continued through to the base of Level 3 (30-40 cmbd/101.116­
101.016) then immediately transitioned to a more brown (10YR4/3) much more
CaCO3-rich, gravelly clay. Isolated black soil staining and pockets of oxidized
clays were observed throughout this 40-centimeter zone. Calcium carbonate
inclusions from 40 to 70 centimeters below datum (101.016-100.716) remained
steady at approximately three percent while chert and limestone gravels
increased in size and density with depth (reaching approximately 45 percent by
the unit’s terminus at 80 centimeters below datum (100.616). While the
southern 2/3 of the unit continued to be primarily composed of 10YR4/3 dark
brown silty clay, the northern 1/3 was noted as being 10YR5/4 yellowish brown
in hue and notably denser gravels. White, chalky filaments were prominent
within the southern soil zone, increasing in frequency with depth to the unit
terminus. The 80-centimeter termination depth was reached following findings
of increased gravel size and density, more frequent chalky inclusions and the
lack of artifacts.
Burned rocks and debitage within Unit 11 generally followed density patterns
observed in the previously-discussed test units. Beginning in the first level with
approximately one pound of burned rock and increasing to its maximum of 59
pounds in Level 3 (30-40 cmbd/101.116-101.016) then decreasing over the next
two levels with Levels 6 and 7 devoid of burned rock (Table 10). Lithic debitage
followed a similar trend beginning with 85 grams of debitage within the first level
and reaching its maximum again in Level 3 with 541 grams then decreasing over
the next three levels (2 g from Level 6) with Level 7 devoid of lithic material. The
clear occupational peak observed in Level 3 corresponded with the upper
elements of Feature 7/22, a rockless pit (Feature 7) with an associated burned
rock scatter (Feature 22).

First observed in Trench 8’s western wall as a small burned rock scatter with
associated charcoal staining. Within the trench profile, Feature 7 was recorded
in an elevation range of 31 through 46 centimeters below the ground surface.
Through Test Unit 11 excavation, the initial elements of Feature 7/22 were
observed as a loose, roughly linear scatter of small burned rocks and charcoal
beginning at 26 centimeters below datum (101.175; Figure 18). The scatter did
not form any intact patterning until Level 3 when the dark charcoal staining was
limited to the southern 1/3 of the eastern wall of the unit. A thin band of
burned rocks surrounded the stain, forming a boundary along its western edge.
In the unit’s northwestern corner, archeologists noted a pocket of dense flakes
and smaller burned rocks. This more cohesive feature scatter corresponds to
the higher tallies of burned rocks and flakes. Measuring approximately 40 x 60
centimeters and forming the western three-quarters of an elongated circle, the
stained sediments (10YR3/2) of Feature 7/22 were bisected and were found to
extend from an intact top elevation of approximately 32 centimeters (101.095) to
55 centimeters (100.866). While the loose elements of the soil stain were
observed resting atop the A-B soil transition zone, the most distinct elements of
the stain were found to lie directly within the B horizon, with the base of the
stain extending into the lower C sediment.
Beginning near the base of Feature 7/22’s soil stain in Unit 11’s southwest
corner, archeologists noted a small, dense burned rock cluster that was
partially, and accidentally removed during sediment sampling. The remaining
clasts (numbering 132 primarily small and medium chert rocks) formed a linear
to slightly arc-shaped scatter and measured approximately 75 x 60 centimeters
(the cluster was demarcated as Feature 22 in the field and later combined with
the soil stain; Figure 18).
The cluster rocks had a top elevation of
approximately 43 centimeters (100.985) and a bottom elevation of 55
centimeters below datum (100.866). The arc formed the southwestern perimeter
of the dark soil stain described above within Level 4 (40-50 cmbd/101.016­
100.916). The burned rocks within this Feature 7/22 cluster were found to be
very dark, powdery grey in color and distinct from all others observed in Unit 11.
Despite their high variation from the higher rock scatter, their overall close
proximity to one another likely places them under the same feature, potentially
fulfilling different functions. The entire burned rock cluster was virtually devoid
of charcoal staining. Noting Feature 7/22’s main elements’ (the rockless soil
stain and the dense cluster) similar base elevations (55 cmbd/100.866) the soil
stain likely is a rockless pit with the dense southwestern perimeter cluster
forming its basal liner rocks. The loose, linear scatter of burned rocks observed
in Level 3 likely represent the feature’s upper lid or rake-out rocks. This
elevation’s correspondence with the unit’s densest artifact assemblage indicates
the occupational surface of the feature.
Test Unit 11 was extensively sampled, particularly in relation to Feature 7/22
(Table 11). A total of six 10 x 10 centimeter column samples were collected
from the unit’s southwest corner (Samples 74, 84, 89, 92, 97 and 100) while an
additional three matrix samples (Samples 87, 91 and 93) and three humates
(Samples 88, 94 and 98) were collected from within Feature 7/22 context.
Samples 87, 89 and 93 contained moderate, but consistent, quantities of
charred mesquite and occasional oak, providing consistent evidence of burning
fuel preferences for this particular feature (see Appendix E and Feature
Discussions). Two pieces of charcoal were also collected during Unit 11
excavation (C-14 Samples 53 and 55). Sample 53, a small piece of charcoal

observed beneath feature rocks near the center of Unit 11’s Level 3 base (40
cmbd/101.016) returned a 2-sigma calibrated radiocarbon date of cal B.P. 1290­
1160 (Beta 212459). This date roughly corresponds with the unit’s Late to
Transitional Archaic/Late Prehistoric diagnostic tally described below. Sample
55, observed near the base of the soil stain, was not analyzed.
In addition to the burned rocks and debitage, a variety of formal tools were also
observed and collected during Unit 11 excavation. As can be seen in Table 12,
two retouched flakes were found in the first 20-centimeter level (Level 1; Unique
Items 217-1 and 2) while an additional 15 tools were recovered within Levels 3-5
(30-60 cmbd/101.116-100.816) including three projectile points and point
fragments (Unique Items 244-1, 244-2 and 244-3), one biface (Unique Item 244­
4), three biface fragments (Unique Items 244-10, 251-2 and 257-1), four
unifaces (Unique Items 244-5-7, 251-1) and four cores (Unique Items 244-8,
244-9, 251-3 and 257-2). Of note, all three projectile points were recovered from
elevations similar to the upper portions of Feature 7/22, north and west of the
main soil stain and burned rocks. These points consisted of a Stage 4a narrow,
Darl-like miscellaneous point fragment (244-1), a Stage 4a Ensor point (244-2)
and an Edwards arrow point fragment (244-3) that was found approximately two
centimeters above the Ensor. Items 244-2 and 3 were recovered at 32 and 30
centimeters below datum (respectively; 101.116 and 101.096) near the central
western and eastern (respectively portions of the test unit north of any intact
elements of Feature 7/22 while Item 244-1, the Darl, was found at 38
centimeters below datum (101.036). Taking into account likely shallow site
overprinting, C-14 Sample 53’s, recovered from similar elevations, returned
measured date of 1300+/-40 B.P. roughly corresponds with all of the dart points
recovered (Collins 2004).
Unit 12
Test Unit 12 was strung as a 2 x 2 meter unit along the northern edge of
Backhoe Trench 8, immediately south of Unit 11 (Figures 5 and 19). The unit
was placed to examine two features exposed in the floor of the trench more
closely (Features 8 and 9). Through eight levels (90 centimeters below Datum
22/100.510), archeologists exposed a single, large burned rock earth oven
feature with intact, overlapping radiocarbon dates dating to the Late Prehistoric,
charred vegetation and diagnostics. This unit and the feature exposed therein
proved to be the most impressive of the excavation.
Unit 12’s ground surface was found to be relatively devoid of burned rocks or
lithics (Figure 19). Soils were loose, light silt (10YR4/2). Like all other units,
the first level was excavated through the first 20 centimeters of the soil column
while the remainder were ten centimeters each (Table 13). Soils within Unit 12
generally consisted of the 10YR4/2 dark, grayish brown silt observed on the
ground surface extending through approximately 35-40 centimeters (101.060­
101.010; A horizon) before becoming slightly darker (10YR3/2; still considered A
Horizon soils) through to the base of Level 4 (50 cmbd/100.910). Most of this
darkening is attributed to the abundant charcoal staining observed within the
main feature context (see below) as sediments immediately outside the burned
rock scatter were slightly lighter. Continuing down through the soil column,
sediments immediately transitioned at approximately 55 centimeters below
datum (100.860) to a paler, dark yellowish brown (10YR4/2), gravelly (25-30%)
clayey silt (B Horizon). Gravel size and composition dramatically increased with
depth from this point, then disappeared by the base of Level 7 (80

cmbd/100.610). Sediments at this point were pale yellow (10YR4/4; C horizon)
with notably dense (>30%) calcium carbonate inclusion throughout. Citing a
lack of artifacts and clear indications of pre-cultural sediment zones,
archeologists terminated Unit 12 excavations at 90 centimeters (100.760).
Burned rock and debitage tallies within Unit 12 point to the distinct
occupational surface between Levels 4 and 5 (Table 13). As with Unit 11,
burned rock and debitage tallies generally increased gradually, reaching a peak
(in this instance within Level 4) then sharply declining beyond that point.
Burned rocks were first noted beginning in Level 2 with a total of 12 pounds and
reached a maximum in Level 4 of 228 pounds before declining over the next
three levels to 0 (67.5 pounds in Level 5, 14 pounds in Level 6 and one pound in
Level 7). Debitage tallies generally varied between 170 and 290 grams through
the first three unit levels then peaked at 503 grams in Level 4. Level 5 was also
particularly high in flake content with nearly 240 grams, however, immediately
after debitage density dropped dramatically, reaching its minimum of 10.8
grams from the top of Level 8.
This peak near Levels 4 and 5 distinctly corresponded to the primary elevation of
Feature 8/9 (Figure 19). Initially recorded at 26-36 centimeters below the
ground surface as two slightly isolated burned rock clusters (Features 8 and 9)
within the base of Trench 8, excavation revealed a large, dense accumulation of
burned rocks near the center and northwestern corner of the unit that extended

to a maximum depth of 52 centimeters below datum (100.890). A distinct
chalky 10YR3/2 clay stain surrounded the burned rock scatter. This staining is
charcoal remnants from feature use as several larger charcoal chunks were
observed and recovered during feature excavation.
At its maximum extent (Unit 12’s Level 4 45-50 cmbd/101.010-100.910),
Feature 8/9 measured approximately 1.8 x 1.6 meters while 228 pounds of
burned rocks were found within the level.
In situ, archeologists plotted
approximately 149 small to large limestone clasts within the level forming a
roughly circular to ovate cluster that occupied the northwestern two-thirds of
the unit. The clustered rocks contained two distinct smaller, ring-shaped rock
pattern elements within the larger cluster while a single, larger central rock
basin formed the feature’s main distributional component. A profile excavated
east-west through the central basin revealed burned rocks that began at an
upper elevation of 37 centimeters (101.040) and extended to approximately 51
centimeters below the datum (100.900).
A dark charcoal stain that
accompanied the entirety of the burned rock cluster continued sharp downward
directly beneath this central depression, reaching a maximum depth of
approximately 68 centimeters (100.730). The feature rested atop the B-C
horizon soil transition with the dark charcoal staining extending down into the
cherty, sterile gravels of the Leona formation.
Given such an extensive and organically-rich feature within its boundaries, Unit
12 was highly sampled during the course of field investigations (Table 14).
Through all unit levels archeologists collected a total of 13 charcoal samples (of
which four were formally analyzed), 10 bulk matrix sediment samples, two
humate samples and seven fixed-dimension column samples. Feature 8/9
received the brunt of all sampling with only the column samples not collected
from immediately within or adjacent to feature boundaries. Analyzed C-14
Samples 35, 40 49 and 51 (Lots 129, 276, 202 and 224 respectively) all
produced overlapping or extremely similar 2-sigma calibrated C-14 dates of
approximately 940-690 B.P., indicating discreet feature deposition and
utilization likely attributed to the Austin Phase of the Late Prehistoric (Table
14). The feature’s complement of diagnostic points (described below), however,
does not match this distinctly overlapping formation date. Sediment samples
from feature context produced abundant organic materials as well; materials
that provide insight into local food and fuel preferences at the time of feature
formation. Within Samples 35, 40, 53, 62, 63, 72 and 78, archeologists isolated
individual elements of charred hackberry and onion bulbs for food as well as a
predominance of mesquite and live oak for cooking (see Feature Discussions
and Appendix E for more detail). This mesquite preference proves unique to the
region and likely indicates the plant’s prevalence in the immediate vicinity of the
site at the time of occupation (likely similar to current conditions, see Appendix
E).
Unit 12 was particularly dense in stone tools. A total of 31 tools were recovered
from the ground surface to Level 6 (60-70 cmbd/100.810-100.710, Table 15)
including two projectile points (Unique Items 131-1 and 161-1), seven cores,
four unifaces, three pieces of groundstone, seven bifaces and biface fragments
and eight use wear and retouched flakes. Unique Item 131-1 was an Ensor
point recovered in situ near the northern center of Unit 12, directly adjacent to
then Feature 8. The point was found at an elevation of 28 centimeters below
datum (101.130). Item 161-1 was also an Ensor point though this one was
recovered at 40 centimeters below datum (101.010) slightly north and east of the

main Feature 8/9 cluster. The consistency of Late Archaic point forms that
predate the overlapping radiocarbon assays by more than a half millennium is
likely an indication of excavation of the pit into the older occupation. Overall,
Unit 12 proved to be the most significant of the Site 41UV68 mitigation
operations. Its dense content of organic materials, overlapping radiocarbon
assays, dart points and clearly intact, dense burned rock patterning are all
suggestions of a large, briefly utilized burned rock hearth dating to the Austin
Phase of the Late Prehistoric. The feature, resting atop dense, sterile river
gravels was the largest and most significant of the excavations on site. Its
proximity to Unit 12’s Feature 7/22 should also not be ignored as similar rock
materials and composition was encountered within both units at similar
elevations. Feature 7/22 represents a similar earth oven pit feature slightly
earlier in time, dated at 1290-1160 B.P., during the Transitional Archaic
Interval. Obviously, the same types of behavior and food processing activities
were consistent between perceived socio-cultural intervals in the later history of
the site.
7.3.2

Revised Pole 1/5 Test Unit 13
Following testing excavations, AEP elected to move the proposed location of Pole
1/5 (named Structure 612) approximately three meters to the northwest (Figure
3). Citing the abundant cultural materials collected during testing of the
original Pole 1/5 location (Testing Unit 2, Miller et al. 2005), Hicks & Company
completed mitigation excavations at the revised Pole 1/5 location. Test Unit 13,
strung near the approximate elevation center of the site area at this new pole
location, contained a complement of cultural materials that was almost
antithetical to that found in Test Unit 2. Despite lying less than three meters
from the original, feature and tool-filled Unit 2, Test Unit 13 was devoid of any
intact features, contained a relatively low inclusion of cultural materials and a
moderate inclusion of modern disturbance, glass and metal fragments.
Test Unit 13 was excavated in seven levels reaching a maximum depth of 90
centimeters below Datum 23 (101.055-100.155, Figures 5 and 20). Sediments
within this first 20 centimeters were described as 10YR3/3 dark brown silty clay
topsoil that was very friable with 3-4% gravels throughout (Table 16). Beneath
this upper level, soils transition over the next 30 centimeters to a pale 10YR6/4
light yellowish brown silty clay with a slightly increasing gravel density with
depth. Darker sediments were persistent in the northern half of the unit while
the southern half was notably paler and contained the larger proportion of rocks
and gravels (Figure 20). Soil profiles of the unit indicate the highest proportion
of limestone gravels lying directly above the transition between the upper, dark
brown sediment to the paler yellowish soils observed first in Unit 2. Particularly
in Levels 2 and 3, archeologists encountered moderate amounts of root
disturbance throughout the test unit.
At a depth of approximately 54
centimeters (100.515) sediments transition to a brown to strong brown
(7.5YR5/4-5/6) dense silty clay with a marked decrease in gravels. In their
place, the sediments in these lower levels contain significant proportions of
caliche (greater than 50%). No staining was observed.
Artifacts and burned rocks found within Test Unit 13 are the most telling
indicators of disturbance. Beginning at Level 1 and extending down to the base
of Level 5 (0-60 cmbd, 101-055-100.455), archeologists recorded a consistent
and steady decrease in both burned rock and lithic debitage density with depth

(burned rocks: 6 lbs in Level 1 and 1.5 lbs in Level 5, lithic debitage: 335 grams
in Level 1 and 13 grams in Level 5; Table 16). While one flake was recovered
from Level 7 (more likely the result of wall scraping than an actual in situ
recovery), cultural materials terminated in Unit 13 at 60 centimeters. As can be
see in Figure 20, burned rocks were consistently small and widely scattered
throughout the unit with no observed patterning within any unit level. While
some rock clustering was observed in the base of Level 2, the burned clasts were
roughly intermixed with unburned cobbles. Equally sparse and scattered were
stone tools. In total, Unit 13 contained only three tools, two bifaces (Unique
Items 203-1-2) in Level 1 and a Frio dart point (Unique Item 206-1) in Level 2
(recovered in the center of the north unit half at a depth of 28 cmbd [100.775];
Table 17). The Frio dart point was found in isolation of any particularly
pronounced artifact concentrations, however it was found approximately two
centimeters above a glass shard and an undetermined metal fragment. This was
a clear indication of modern intrusion. While a column sample was consistently
collected from Unit 13’s northwest corner from Levels 2-7 (Column Samples 66,
68, 71, 73, 76 and 81) archeologists did not note any charcoal within any unit
level (Table 18).
Unit 13 stood in total contrast to the findings in Unit 2 from the testing phase of
excavations at the site. Where Unit 2 yielded 10 stone tools in just its upper 30
centimeters (101.080-100.780) including a Fariland and a Marcos projectile
point, Unit 13 contained a total of only two tools. While exhibiting a similar
decrease in quantity with depth, burned rocks within Unit 2 were much more
varied in size class with more than 15 pounds of large burned rocks recovered in
Levels 2 and 3 compared to none within any of Unit 13’s levels. The pronounced
clustering of Feature 1, observed in Unit 2’s Levels 2-4, was absent in any
portion of Unit 13.
The unit as a whole was devoid of any significant
archeological materials and was more consistent with artificial disturbance (the
Frio dart point recovered beneath modern debris, a dense gravel blanket at the
base of the upper soil horizon, consistent and steady decreases of debitage and
burned rocks with depth), potentially as a result of the placement of the original
Pole 1/5. Why this area is so dramatically different from Unit 2’s is unclear,
however it is certainly pronounced.

8.1.1

Feature 21
Initially, Feature 21 was broadly defined as a poorly structured group of
limestone and chert rock clusters distributed throughout Levels 2-4 of Unit 8
(Figure 5; Figures 21-23). Following the excavation of the levels and analysis of
the data, Feature 21 was more precisely defined as an ovoid cluster of 43 chert
and limestone rocks, many of which showed definite evidence of burning (Figure
23).

Figure 22: Unit 8, Level 3 Plan View, Feature 21

The central portion of Feature 21 is approximately one meter in length east-west
and a half meter in width north-south, and is situated between 37-50
centimeters below datum (101.583-101.453) in elevation. This central portion
was a relatively flat single layer of rocks. In addition to this central portion, an
additional 109 rocks were mapped in Levels 2, 3, and 4 that were part of the
larger occupation zone, and may be associated with Feature 21 (Figures 21-23).

Figure 23: Unit 8, Levels 4 and 5, Overlapped Plan View, Features 4 and 21

The total weight of rock recovered from Feature 21, including the unclearly
associated rock, was 40 pounds. Generally speaking, the central portion of the
hearth was lower in elevation than the surrounding rock clusters. Though no
pit feature was recorded in association with Feature 21, the overall disposition of
the feature may suggest a possible pit hearth and associated rake-out pile or
multiple dispersed and overlapping hearths.

Archeological Mitigation – UV68 – July 2007

77

Feature Discussions

Once the primary locus of the feature was defined, excavators removed the
central portions of Feature 21 as a sediment sample (Sample 86) and a humate
sample (Sample 85; Figure 23). The humate sample was sent to Beta Analytic
for analysis and returned a 2-sigma calibrated date of 2140-1930 B.P., dating
the feature to the Late Archaic I period (Table 2). There was however, no
staining or charcoal associated with this section of the feature. In fact, staining
was absent in any of the Feature 21 area. Only a single sample of charcoal (C­
14 Sample 50, Lot 210) was identified during the excavation of Levels 2 and 3,
and this charcoal was only in vague association with the feature. This sample
was small and dispersed and was insufficient to submit for analysis. An
additional humate sample (Sample 80) was taken from beneath the large stone
adjacent to and higher in elevation but not firmly associated with the central
cluster (Figure 22). This humate sample returned a 2-sigma calibrated date of
1170-970 B.P. This date combined with the other humate date indicate that the
A horizon occupation zone associated with Feature 21 can be bracketed between
2140-970 B.P. These dates may however be too young as a consequence of
infiltration of more recent materials into the sample.
The most common artifact recovered in association with Feature 21 was
debitage. Debitage was recovered in a relatively high density intermixed within
the limestone and chert in both the feature and in the general level 2, 3, and 4
contexts (Table 1). Several large chert flakes were mapped in situ and several
were noted as standing on edge (Figures 21-23). In Level 2, a multidirectional
core (Unique Item 204-6) and a Stage 4 biface (Unique Item 204-4) were all
recovered from amongst the scattered stones (Table 3). In Level 3, three
additional cores (Unique Items 213-3, 4, 5) and a Stage 4 biface fragment
(Unique Item 213-2) were recovered. In Level 4 a unidirectional core (Unique
Item 229-3) was recovered from within the feature. Another unidirectional core
(Unique Item 242-2) was first mapped in Level 4 and collected in Level 5, and
was located approximately 25 centimeters outside of the feature focus. More
significant, a projectile point (Unique Item 213-1) was recovered in the northeast
corner of Level 3 near the edge of Feature 21 at an elevation of 32 centimeters
below datum (101.633). This finished Stage 4 projectile point was identified as a
Nolan type point. Nolan points are recognized as dating to the Middle Archaic.
Given the later than Middle Archaic dates returned in the two humate samples,
this projectile point may have been stratigraphically out of place as a result of
disturbance in this portion of the site, or perhaps was collected by later site
inhabitants from an earlier occupation or nearby site. As previously noted,
however, the possibility for the humate samples to be contaminated by more
recent material makes firm conclusions about the temporal relationships
between the projectile point and the associated features tentative at best.
Stronger evidence for the general supposition that this point is out of place is
provided by C-14 Sample 52 collected from within the B horizon sediment,
stratigraphically beneath the Feature 21 (see Test Unit 8 and Feature 4
discussion). This radiocarbon sample returned a 2-sigma calibrated date of
3340-3070 B.P., and based on the unambiguous stratigraphic relationships
between Feature 21 in the A horizon and the B horizon stratum from which the
charcoal sample was collected, Feature 21 almost certainly post dates this
period.
In light of the collected data, Feature 21 is interpreted as a small hearth feature
constructed from mostly small and medium chert and limestone cobbles that
was a component of a larger occupational zone. The hearth-like aspects of the
feature are primarily its shape and disposition and the presence of burned rock.
There was no evidence for ash or charcoal present in the center of feature. This
Archeological Mitigation – UV68 – July 2007

Feature Discussions

lack of ash or charcoal may be a factor of the low depositional rates active at the
site complicated by colluvial and aeolian erosional effects. Though there are a
number of tools associated with the primary locus of the feature, these do not in
and of themselves suggest a preserved activity area. At most, the presence of
debitage and broken tools and cores suggests that some basic lithic reduction
activities including tool manufacture and flake manufacture were engaged in the
immediate vicinity of the feature.
8.1.2

Feature 4
Feature 4 was a small hearth recorded during the trenching of the site during
trenching of the site at an elevation of 42 centimeters below datum (101.533;
Figure 5). The feature was originally defined as cluster of 18 limestone and
chert rocks in Backhoe Trench 3 that measured approximately 60 x 60
centimeters in size. Subsequent excavation better defined Feature 4 as a cluster
of 26 limestone and chert rocks that range in elevation from 42 and 56
centimeters below datum (101.533-101.423; Figure 23).
Feature 4 measured 75 centimeters north-south and 65 centimeters east-west.
The Feature 4 rocks form a single layer with the majority of the rock tops having
an elevation between 49 and 50 centimeters below datum (101.493-101.483).
Though Feature 4 is explicitly defined as a small cluster of 26 rocks, it was
found associated with a larger number of limestone and chert rocks that
comprised the surrounding occupational zone in Levels 4, 5 and 6 (Figure 23).
In total 92 rocks weighing 24.5 pounds were collected, though the majority (68)
were found in Level 5 with the feature focus. Sixty-seven of the rocks were
smaller than five centimeters in diameter (67/9.5 lbs), with and additional
21(11.5 lbs) between 5-10 centimeters in diameter, and 4 (5.5 lbs) larger than 10
centimeters in diameters. Approximately 20% of the rocks were identified in the
field as limestone and the rest were chert. Many of the rocks showed signs of
thermal alteration including discoloration, potlidding, and fracturing. Although
much of rock showed evidence of burning, no charcoal was observed in the
immediate Feature 4 area, though a small area of oxidized soil was recorded east
of the feature at 55-60 centimeters below datum (101.403-101.353).
Once Feature 4 was defined, one half of the feature matrix was collected as a
sediment sample (Sediment Sample 96) and the other half as a humate sample
(Sediment Sample 95). The analysis of the sediment sample did not identify any
significant macrobotanical remains or associated charcoal (Appendix 3; Table
2). A single charcoal sample (C-14 Sample 52) was collected approximately 15
centimeters north of the Feature 4 at an elevation of 54 centimeters below
datum (101.413) and returned a 2-sigma calibrated date of 3340-3070 B.P.
(Beta 212458).
During the excavation of Feature 4, no artifacts were mapped within the primary
feature cluster. Artifacts were recovered in increasingly lower density in the
surrounding level fill of Levels of 4, 5 and 6, however, with the most common
type being debitage and twelve tools recovered (Tables 1 and 3). The tools not
in close association with Feature 21 in the same levels included three bifaces
(Unique Items 229-1, 254-1, 254-4), three cores (Unique Item 242-1, 254-2,
254-3), and two use wear flakes (Unique Items 229-5, 229-6) and the base of a
projectile point (Unique Item 229-1). The projectile point base was recovered in
situ 15 centimeters north of Feature 4 at an elevation of 47 centimeters below
datum (101.483). The base is a crudely flaked Stage 2 rectangular base with
alternate beveling. Typologically this specimen has an affinity to Nolan points

Feature Discussions

based on the basal shape and evidence of beveling, and it has been provisionally
identified as an indeterminate Middle Archaic form.
Interpreting Feature 4 is complicated by the poor state of preservation and the
lack of associated materials that can be directly linked with feature utilization.
Based on the general shape and content of the feature, however, it is interpreted
as being a small surface hearth. Artifacts and rock recovered in the surrounding
level matrix indicate that this feature is part of a larger occupation zone situated
in the B horizon deposit. The radiocarbon date provided by C14 sample 52
suggests the feature may date to approximately 3340-3070 B.P.
8.1.3

Feature 5
Feature 5 was originally defined during the initial trenching of the site at the
beginning of the Phase III excavations in Backhoe Trench 5 (Figure 5; Figure
24). Based on the limited exposure afforded by the backhoe trench, Feature 5
was initially described as a possible hearth consisting of a cluster of 25 small to
medium chert and limestone cobbles, some clearly burned, and believed to
continue eastward. The top of the feature was located at 23 centimeters below
datum (101.495). To better define Feature 5, Unit 9 was strung over Feature 5.
The excavation of Unit 9 better defined Feature 5 not as a singular feature but
as an unorganized scatter of 104 limestone and chert cobbles weighing 46
pounds and intermixed with gravels, snail, debitage and other lithic artifacts
indicative of a dense occupation zone (Figure 24; Table 4). These materials are
all situated within the A horizon soils (10YR4/3 Brown) in Levels 3 and 4 (20-40
centimeters below datum/101.525-101.325), and terminate in Level 4 at the
point of transition to the underlying B horizon 10YR4/3.5 dark yellowish brown
sediment. As this accumulation is no longer considered a hearth feature, but
material associated with the larger occupation zone, no additional description of
Feature 5 will be presented.

8.1.4

Feature 20
Feature 20 is a small hearth that was identified during the excavation of Level 4
in Unit 9 (Figure 5; Figure 25). Feature 20 is a tightly clustered group of 43
chert and limestone rocks, some of which are clearly burned, in an area of dark
stained matrix that extends off to the west from the central feature focus. Based
on the excavation and the bisection of the central part of the feature, Feature 20
is a single layer of cobbles 60x60 centimeters in horizontal spread that ranged
vertically between 24-31 centimeters below datum (101.485-101.415).
Secondary aspects of the feature are present as scattered clusters of smaller
stones surrounding the central portion of the feature and trailing off to the west
within areas of dark soil staining. Feature 20 is situated in A horizon sediments
(10YR4/3) within the zone of the highest artifact and rock concentrations in the
unit and rests on the underlying B horizon deposit.
Though the central focus of the feature as defined by analysis includes only 43
rocks, a total of 135 pieces of limestone and chert rock weighing 16.5 pounds
were recovered in situ and from screening the surrounding feature matrix that
included all areas of staining (Figure 25). The total consisted of 119 (7 lbs)
rocks less than five centimeters in size, 14 (5.5 lbs) between 5 and 10
centimeters, and two large cobbles weighing four pounds. Though a number of
the limestone and chert cobbles are obviously burned, no associated charcoal
was collected during the excavation of Feature 20.

Samples of feature matrix were collected from each half of the bisection of
Feature 20 (Figure 25 and 26). The western half was collected as Humate
Sample 43 and the eastern half as Matrix Sample 44. The humate sample was
sent to Beta Analytic for bulk organic sediment AMS dating and returned 2­
sigma calibrated date of 1570-1410 B.P. (Beta 212455; Table 5). The results of
the processing of the bulk matrix sample did not identify any prehistoric seeds
or plant material and no charcoal (Appendix E).

Figure 26: North Profile of Feature 20

Only one artifact was piece plotted in direct association with Feature 20. This is
a chert cobble (Unique Item 139-3) that was collected at 28 centimeters below
datum on the eastern edge of Feature 20 and was identified in the field as a
possible piece of ground or battered stone (Figure 25; Table 6). Though there is
a lightly battered quality to the cobble edges, the evidence for intentional or
prolonged use of this artifact is poor. Within the context of Feature 20, this chert
cobble, like the other chert cobbles that make up the feature, appears to have
functioned as a heating element. Four other lithic tools were recovered from the
surrounding level contexts (see Table 6), but these did not have clear
association with the feature. Excavators did note a possible increase in the
recovery of debitage in the area around the central portion of Feature 20.
As a whole, Feature 20 is fairly compact cluster of limestone and chert situated
within a larger occupational zone. The central portion of the feature appeared to
be intact, but lacked any associated artifacts or data from the collected sediment
samples that unequivocally defined the precise function. Though a general dark
staining was observed around and west of Feature 20, the excavations did not
recover any associated charcoal and there is no evidence that this is part of a
larger pit feature. Nonetheless, the clear thermal alteration of several of the
Feature 20 rocks and the overall shape suggest that this feature functioned as a
small hearth. The absence of charcoal or ash may in part be a factor of erosion
and exposure, particularly if this feature was on an exposed surface. The 2­
sigma calibration date of 1570-1410 B.P. obtained from Humate Sample 43 that
was taken from the western half of the feature, indicated a Late Archaic II date
for this feature and associated occupation zone.

Feature 6
Feature 6 is interpreted as a small burned rock hearth that has been highly
disturbed by persistent, significant root intrusion. While the burned rock

Feature Discussions

cluster may have at one point been relatively intact like previously-discussed
features, roots and root burns have essentially destroyed all remaining feature
context within Test Unit 10.
The feature was first observed along the grid eastern wall of Backhoe Trench 7,
approximately 12-37 centimeters below the ground surface. Within the trench
profile, archeologists observed a collection of approximately 10 medium and 12­
15 small burned rocks arranged in a slight, downward south-trending basin
shape (Figure 5). The whole cluster covered an area of approximately 76
centimeters in length. Above this slight “basin”, sediments were found to be
oxidized with three pockets of tan to orange sandy clays intermixed within the
10YR4/2 A horizon matrix. One very large piece of charcoal was observed
approximately seven centimeters above a dense cluster of gravels and burned
rock. Citing the abundance of charcoal and the potential for intact burned rock
patterning, Test Unit 10 was strung along Trench 7, adjacent to its edge, to
come down on the feature from above.
While light scatters of burned rock were found throughout the first two levels,
Feature 6 became more distinct and prominent beginning in Unit 10’s Level 3
(20-30 cmbd/101.402-101.302) with the clear remaining intact portions of the
feature limited to Level 4 (30-40 cmbd/101.302-101.202). This elevation range
is roughly equivalent to that observed within the profile of Trench 7. Within
Level 3, archeologists noted a broad scatter of approximately 113 small and
medium burned limestone rocks and 131 small burned chert gravels (34 pounds
overall) spreading in a roughly linear fashion from the grid southwest to
northwest corner of the unit. The burned clasts were described as rounded to
sub-angular with a roughly equal mix of burned rock and unburned limestone
pebbles. The scatter line was bounded on the west by a large grouping of
decayed and decaying tree roots and occasional spots of roots clearly burned in
place. Soil discoloration was not prominent but was noted in slight pockets
throughout the root-scattered area. None of the rocks bore any patterning until
the next level.
Within Level 4, Feature 6’s loose scatter of small to medium burned rocks
quickly transitioned to a much more distinct cluster within the center of Unit 10
by the base of Level 4 (Figure 27). Occupying an area of approximately 70
centimeters east-west by the full width of the unit, Feature 6 was composed of
approximately 46 burned limestone rocks (20 pounds) and 49 burned chert
chunks and gravels (16 pounds). Chert clasts were primarily limited to the
southeast corner of the cluster. Burned rocks were found in all size categories
including eight large limestone clasts. Rock elevations were generally higher
near the center of the cluster and descended sharply the farther from the center
they were found. Where the tops of the center cluster rocks were found at 31-33
centimeters below datum (101.292-101.272; the highest burned rock was
recorded at 28 cmbd), rocks at the immediate periphery were found at 36-39
centimeters below datum (101.242-101.212). A profile excavated through this
densest feature area revealed a maximum depth of 37.5 centimeters below
datum (101.237) in the main cluster. This profile revealed a generally level,
single-layer-thick burned rock scatter with a very slight possible central basin
near the unit’s western edge (roughly corresponding with the hearth remnant’s
center). Immediately beneath this level, soils transitioned to the lower C
horizon, carbonate-rich, sterile Leona formation clays.

Figure 27: Clustering of Burned Rocks in Unit 10’s Level 4, Feature 6

Root clusters were observed within all feature-related unit levels. In most
instances, the feature rocks appeared to have been displaced and shifted as a
result of this root intrusion as the clusters bore an appearance of a “once-intact”
nature but were now more scattered. This root intrusion had also thoroughly
compromised any charcoal found within feature context as most of the root
matter (often still containing bark) bore clear evidence of fairly recent burning
(Figure 17).
Burned rock recovery in relation to Feature 6 followed anticipated trends with a
gradual increase in burned rocks (21 lbs in Level 2, 34 lbs in Level 3) with depth
to its zenith in Level 4 (41 lbs), then a steep decrease into lower elevations (4.5
lbs in Level 5, 2 lbs in Level 6; Table 7). Curiously, flake counts were at their
peak in the upper-most feature level (Level 2) with a total of 473 grams of flakes
recovered. Levels 3 and 4 yielded very similar, though much lower tallies at 296
and 232 grams (respectively). This disparity between burned rock and flake
counts is either an indication of modern disturbance within the feature context
or secondary flake deposition from occupations higher on the site’s landform.
The latter interpretation is less likely as similar flake distributions would have
been observed within other units and Feature 6’s debitage tally is more
anomalous than other features’ recoveries.
Two charcoal samples were collected within Unit 10’s Level 4 (Samples 45 and
46; Table 8). These charcoal chunks were recovered beneath feature rocks
along the northern (42 cmbd/101.182) and eastern (40.5 cmbd/101.192)
periphery of the main Feature 6 cluster. Citing the extensive root intrusion
observed, neither of the charcoal samples were submitted for formal dating.
Three column samples (Sediment Samples 37, 42, and 48), one bulk matrix
sample (Sediment Sample 49) and one humate sample (Sediment Sample 50)
totaled the soil samples collected within the main Feature 6 levels (Levels 2-4).
None of these samples were submitted for formal analysis.

Formal tool recovery within Feature 6 unit levels included one projectile point
(Item 150-2) recovered in the eastern-central portion of the Unit 10’s Level 3 (20­
30 cmbd/101.402-101.302; Table 9). This find location was approximately 20
centimeters northeast of main feature cluster and above the feature’s densest
components. The fragment was a Marcos-Castroville that was very large and
noted as highly burned and heat-spalled (Figure 28).
Staging was not
determinable due to the extensive heat damage on the fragment. Other tools
included two groundstones (a limestone mano – Item 141-2, an undetermined
groundstone fragment – Item 141-3), a multidirectional core (Item 141-1) and
three use wear flakes from Level 2, a uniface from Level 3 (Item 150-1) and a
biface fragment (Item 164-1) from Level 4. One ocher fragment was also found
in situ along the western periphery of the main feature cluster in Level 4 at an
elevation of 42 centimeters (101.182; Figure 29).

Overall, Feature 6 was generally light and non-descript in general composition.
Extensive root disturbance throughout all feature-related levels (and beyond)
appeared to have shifted a once-intact cluster. The burned rock scatter was
likely a small hearth remnant. Light debitage and tool densities indicates only
limited feature utilization.
8.1.6

Feature 7/22
Feature 7/22 is interpreted as a discreet, rockless soil stain pit with associated
rake-out scatter, initially exposed and recorded as two separate burned rock and
soil stain features in Trench 7 and Test Unit 11 and later combined into a single
entity. Given that the two features were observed and recorded separately (at
least initially), they will be discussed as such, then summarized as a whole.
Feature 7 was initially observed in Trench 7’s grid west wall approximately 1.75­
2.15 meters from its southern terminus (Figure 5). The feature was recorded as
a possible basin-shaped hearth with charcoal staining, oxidized sediment and
burned rocks. Within the trench profile, the soil staining had a top elevation of
31 centimeters below the surface while the features profile base reached a
maximum depth of approximately 46 centimeters below the surface. The profile
consisted of a dense zone of discolored sediment with two burned rocks lining
the perimeter and a third burned rock approximately 10 centimeters to the
north, marking the feature’s base. The staining and rock clustering was deemed
intact enough to warrant investigation in Test Unit 11.
Within Test Unit 11, elements of Feature 7 were first recorded within Level 2
(but more cohesively beginning in Level 3) as a loose scatter of burned rock
intermixed with darker charcoal stained sediment and occasional pockets of clay
oxidation. The cluster was found to lie directly above the contact point between
the A and B horizon sediments with a top elevation of the rocks at approximately
26 centimeters below datum (101.056) and extending down though 10YR3/4­
4/2 dark brown silty clays. At this upper feature context, Feature 7 was
composed of loose, subangular to rounded burned rocks loosely scattered
throughout most of the unit, with slightly more dense clustering in the northern,
southern and eastern portions of Level 3. In situ feature rocks were found to be
burned chert and limestone in a respective 2:1 overall weight ratio. Near the
western center, the burned rocks were particularly small and densely packed
with debitage (Figure 30) while the southeast unit corner contained the vast
majority of stained (10YR3/2) and oxidized (10YR7/3) sediment, an area that
was relatively devoid of burned rock. While soil staining was noted as scattered
throughout the unit within the previous level, the distinct stain described above
became readily evident at approximately 32 centimeters below datum (101.096)
and continued beyond the base of the level (101.016; Figure 30). Within this
upper level, the burned rock appeared to form a slight arc around this distinct
stained area, while the dense debitage and burned rock scatter roughly
corresponded in elevation with the altered sediment.
Continuing deeper into the soil column, burned rocks in the northern portions
of the unit dramatically decreased, replaced with unburned limestone pebbles
and cobbles, while those in the south (particularly the southwest corner) became
more dense. Throughout the level, only the unit’s southwest corner exhibited
distinct clustering resembling an intact burned rock feature. Rocks within this
corner were found to be notably larger and composed of a paler gray colored

chert than in any other portion of the unit. This variation from the smaller,
cobbles observed in the previous levels is a notable distinction that likely defines
the two elements’ functional variation. Unfortunately due to corner column
sample placement (Sample 89, Lot 252, also through the southwest corner),
approximately half of this dense cluster was lost during sampling. What
remained was found to be distinct enough to warrant designation as a feature
separate from the primarily soil stain Feature 7 and was given the designation of
Feature 22 (see below).
The densest soil stain elements of Feature 7/22, were isolated to a 40 x 60
centimeter area that continued from the previous level at roughly the same
location along the southern third of the eastern unit wall (Figure 30). A slight
scattering of small burned chert and limestone rocks were found to “ring” the
western and northern perimeter of the stain. Archeologists elected to leave what
remained of the soil stain pedastalled in situ and excavate the rest of Unit 11
(including Feature 22; see below) through to sterility. This pedastalled stain was
later bisected once excavation had cleared any intact elements, revealing a
basined, 10YR3/2 very dark grayish brown silty clay stain with pockets of

Feature Discussions

bright, oxidized sediment and other clusters of small burned rock shatter
(Figure 31). The pedastalled stain extended to a maximum depth of 55
centimeters below datum (100.866), abruptly transitioning to the C horizon
10YR5/4 yellowish brown highly gravelly silty clay with extensive CaCO3 and
nominal artifacts. This base elevation brought the total elevation range of the
feature to 29 centimeters. The boundary between the sediment stain and the
natural soil formed a distinct basin shape with the eastern profile edge stain
boundary at 46 centimeters and the western at 48 (100.956 and 100.936,
respectively; Figure 31).
Figure 31: Feature 7/22 Profile

The dense burned rock cluster observed in the unit’s grid southwest corner
(named in the field as Feature 22) had a top elevation of 43 centimeters below
datum (100.985) and extended through an elevation range of 12 centimeters,
terminating at its southern corner at 55 centimeters below datum (100.866), the
same terminal elevation as the adjacent soil stain (Feature 7; Figure 32).
Roughly linear to arced in shape and extending outside of the southern and
western unit corners, Feature 7/22’s main rock cluster occupied an area within
Unit 11 of approximately 0.45 square meters (76 cm North-South x 62 cm EastWest). The rocks formed the southwestern perimeter of the dark soil stain
described above. A total of 30 medium and one large-sized dark, chalky graycolored burned chert and limestone cobbles were found within the feature area
(those remaining after Column Sampling) along with 122 small examples. Total,
feature rocks composed approximately 16 pounds. The rock cluster was found
to be free of any soil staining but was rather, wholly found within natural B
horizon sediment (primarily resting atop the C soils). Rocks were distinctly
different from virtually all others within Unit 11 and were more closely
reminiscent to those within Feature 8/9 (see below).
Soil and charcoal samples within the main feature context was relatively limited.
Two charcoal samples were collected during Feature 7/22 excavation (C-14
Samples 53 and 55; Table 11). Sample 53 was collected from beneath a denser
burned rock cluster of Feature 7 at an elevation of 40 centimeters below datum
(101.016). The sample was formally analyzed (Beta 212459; charcoal) and

produced a 2-sigma calibrated C-14 date of cal B.P. 1290-1160. Sample 55,
collected from the soil stain bisect at the base of the stain (56 cmbd/100.856)
was not analyzed. Feature soil samples included four column samples (74, 84,
89, 92), three matrix samples (87, 91, 93) and three humate samples (88, 94,
98). Aside from the column samples, all of the samples were collected from
stained sediments primarily associated with Feature 7. Samples 93 and 94 were
collected from beneath the Feature 7/22 rocks. According to Phil Dering,
analyzed soil samples including Samples 87, 89, 91 and 93 did contain viable
plant remains. Those remains were virtually entirely identified as mesquite
wood (Prosopis sp.) with three oak (Quercus sp.) examples recovered from
Sample 87. No foods were recovered. Modern disturbance including root
intrusion, insect parts and rodent pellets were also noted within most of the
samples. While the feature lacks food remnants, the vegetation remains to
exhibit a clear preference for mesquite for fuel within this portion of the site
(Appendix E).
Artifact densities within Features 7 and 22 generally followed expected density
trends. Debitage within Level 2 weighted in at 238 grams, then peaked at 541
grams by the base of Level 3. Below this level, flake weights drop of significantly

Feature Discussions

(Table 10). Burned rock tallies followed the same trend, peaking at Level 3,
then dropping off immediately afterward (Table 10). This peak elevation
corresponds with the broadest expanse of Feature 7 noted at the base of Level 3.
Formal tools within the feature context included three projectile
points/fragments, four bifaces/fragments, four cores and four unifaces (Table
11). All three of the projectile points (Unique Items 244-1, 2 and 3) were
recovered within the upper-most portions of the feature at elevations ranging
from 30 to 38 centimeters below datum (101.116-101.036). Unique Item 244-1
is noted as a Darl-like miscellaneous point fragment. Item 244-2 is a Stage 4a
Ensor Point recovered near the central eastern wall of the unit at an elevation of
32 centimeters below datum (101.096) above the majority of the soil staining.
The remaining point was identified as an Edwards arrow point. The points’ Late
and Transitional Archaic and Late Prehistoric forms are more or less consistent
with the recovered C-14 date of 1290-1160 B.P.
In the field, archeologists interpreted Feature 7/22 as two separate and
functionally variant features. Feature 7 was thought to be a diffuse, potentially
modified soil stain with slight remnant evidence of cultural activity, while
Feature 22 was thought to be talus of the larger Feature 8/9 located
approximately three meters to the south. Rocks from Feature 22 were very
similar to those in Feature 8/9 while disparate from the other rocks observed in
the Feature 7/22’s higher elevations and find elevations were virtually identical
(100.866 for Feature 22 and 100.900 for Feature 8/9).
More refined
interpretation indicates that the soil stain was a rockless earthen pit with the
dense lower burned rock cluster forming the basal peripheral rock lining. The
loose, undefined scatter of distinctly smaller and more varied burned rocks that
marked the feature’s upper surface (the surface that, from artifact density, was
the features occupational surface) represents the pit’s upper lid rocks or rakeout. The feature’s inclusion of Late to Transitional Archaic projectile points
compares quite closely with the terminal Archaic/Transitional Archaic
radiocarbon ages, one borderline with the advent of the Late Prehistoric Interval.
8.1.7

Feature 8/9
Feature 8/9 was initially recorded as two separate rock clusters (Features 8 and
9), approximately one meter apart within the base of Backhoe Trench 8, near its
northern terminus. Subsequent excavation revealed that the two were the
upper-most extensions of a much larger single hearth/pit feature. Feature 8
was observed with a top elevation of 36 centimeters below the surface and
measured approximately 36 x 60 centimeters while Feature 9 was found 10
centimeters higher (26 cmbs), measuring approximately 54 x 52 centimeters
(Figure 33). Both clusters were defined as discreet, round to ovate in shape and
composed of approximately 20 highly-angular, burned limestone rocks.
Recorders of Feature 8 also noted intermixed flecks of charcoal within the
cluster as well. The two features were determined to warrant further excavation
so Test Unit 12 was strung across the base of Trench 8 to expose both features
in full in a more controlled setting.
During excavation within Unit 12, Feature 8/9 was first contacted near the base
of Level 2 as a slight cluster of six burned rocks, expanding the known portions
of Feature 9. However, the feature was exposed in earnest beginning in Level 3.
Within Level 3, Feature 8/9 broadened into four small, discreet clusters of
burned limestone and occasional chert, forming a slight ring-like shape through

Archeological Mitigation – UV68 – July 2007

91

Feature Discussions

Figure 33: Features 8 and 9 in Base of Trench 8

the western 2/3 of the unit (Figures 34 and 35). Rocks within the level ranged
in top elevation from 30 to 40 centimeters below datum (101.110-101.010) with
the majority lying between 34 and 37 centimeters below datum (101.070­
101.040). Top elevations bore a slight indication of northwest-ward descent of
the top of the feature across the unit, however, this descent was very slight (less
than 3-5 centimeters). Intermixed primarily within the northern-most cluster,
archeologists noted continued charcoal flecking as well as distinct pockets of
oxidized sediments. Cluster rocks were primarily left in situ as excavation
proceeded into lower elevations.
By the base of Level 4, gaps between the previously-noted rock clusters filled in,
forming a broad, loose burned rock accumulation. At this broadest elevation,
the burned rocks occupied an area of approximately 1.8 x 1.6 meters, centered
in the northwestern quad of the unit. Archeologists noted that smaller rocks
were found near the center of the jumble, while larger ones (still classified
mostly as “medium” with a few “large” examples) were scattered around the
rough periphery. Excavators noted a ring-like shape to the 149 burned rocks
with a top elevation around the perimeter of approximately 40-44 centimeters
below datum (101.010-100.970). The cluster’s central top elevation was slightly
lower at approximately 46 centimeters below datum (100.950). While the
surrounding sediment matrix was primarily a dark, yellowish brown color,
sediments between the feature rocks were much darker, discolored by
significant charcoal staining. Stained sediments observed near the upper
portions of the feature had spread to occupy most of the matrix between the
rocks (Figures 36 and 37).

Figure 34: Excavation in Progress in Unit 12

As the feature rocks extended down to a maximum depth of approximately 52
centimeters below datum (100.890), the broad, somewhat loose cluster of
primarily small and medium burned rocks tightened, forming an area of
approximately 140 x 100 centimeters, centering around the central portion of
the western half of the unit (Figures 36-38). Archeologists plotted a total of 141
burned rocks within this much tighter cluster. A very noticeable central basin
measuring 70 centimeters across (N-S) was observed along the western wall of
Unit 12, approximately 60 centimeters from the north wall (Figure 39). Marking
the perimeter of this depression were a series of large, diagonally-oriented
limestone rocks surrounding a flat, horizontal, central limestone slab rock
(Figure 40). The slab rock had a top elevation of 41 centimeters below datum
(101.000) and measured approximately 11 centimeters N-S (it’s largest
dimension).
Two smaller ring-shaped rock aggregations were found
approximately 25 and 40 centimeters to the east and south-southeast
(respectively) as slight, but distinct, depressions in the overall rock cluster
elevations. Each measured approximately 20-35 centimeters across. The
southern-most ring also contained a large (12 cm diameter) central slab rock at
42 centimeters below datum (100.990). Archeologists noted large charcoal
chunks within the basin and rings as well as isolated of orange, oxidized
sediment (see below).
Beyond the base of these depressions, burned rock quantities immediately
declined (228 lbs 40-50 cmbd/101.010-100.910 to 67.5 lbs 50-60
cmbd/100.910-100.810), giving way to dense compact cherty and quartzy
gravels and cobbles (observed in the base of the trench farther to the south).
From excavation, it was clear that the feature was resting atop the transitional
zone between the B and the lower Leona formation soil zones.

Figure 38: Feature 8/9 At Its Densest Accumulation

As in the upper feature elevations, a dark, silty charcoal discoloration of the soil
continued into the lower portions (Figure 41). As feature elevation declined, the
dark coloration grew smaller and more confined to the northwestern corner of
the unit (Figure 41). Isolated chunks of charcoal and oxidized sediment were
common within this stained area.
A profile was cut through the feature rocks along an east-west axis,
approximately 50 centimeters south of the northern unit perimeter. This line
corresponded with the approximate center of the main, largest basin. As the
profile indicates (Figure 42), there is a clear basining of feature rocks in the area
that originally was Feature 8. Where the highest rocks had an elevation range of
37-40 centimeters below datum (101.040-101.010), the central depression was
approximately 44-51 centimeters in depth (100.970-100.900). Through most of
it, the dark soil stain continued below the rocks to a depth of 68 centimeters
(100.730). Pockets of unburned gravels were discolored by the sediment
staining. Directly beneath the central depression, the soil staining continued to
more than 70 centimeters below datum (100.710; Figure 42 and 43). A profile
of Unit 12’s west wall provides a very similar picture of the composition of
Feature 8/9 (Figure 44). Within this profile, burned rocks made a notable dip
from 32(t)-42(b) centimeters below datum down to 38(t)-60(b) from 20 to 60
centimeters from the north wall. Likewise, the dark soil stain dipped at the
same location (Figure 44).
With such a large burned rock feature containing an abundant assortment of
charcoal and discolored sediment, Feature 8/9 was heavily sampled through the
course of its excavation. A total of 14 C-14 Samples (C-14 Samples 35, 36, 38­

consisted of pockets of oxidized soil, humates beneath feature rocks and column
samples (please refer to Table 14 for all sample provenience data).
Four of the samples of selected provenience were sent for formal dating. Sample
35 was a small charcoal chunk found within the original Feature 8 rock cluster
near the eastern edge of the original Trench 8 footprint at an elevation of 39
centimeters below datum (101.020), near the top of the feature range. The
resulting 2-sigma calibrated date produced from the sample (Beta 212452) was

Sample 39, approximately 10 centimeters east of then Feature 9. The large
charcoal chunk was recovered within a small, secondary rock cluster away from
the main feature rocks, but directly between two large burned rocks that would

later become part of Feature 8/9. The sample (Beta 212454), collected within an
elevation range of 37-44 centimeters below datum (101.040-100.970) produced
a slightly younger, but very similar, 2-sigma radiocarbon date of 910-690 B.P.
Lower in the feature column, Sample 49 was collected from the southern minor
ring-like rock cluster between the large slab rock and a neighboring basin rock
at an elevation of 44 centimeters below datum (100.970). The resulting 2-sigma
date (Beta 212456) of 940-760 B.P. matches that of Sample 35 exactly, clearly
indicating the temporally-intact nature of the feature deposits. Finally, C-14
Sample 51 was collected between three small basal burned rocks near the
northern edge of Unit 12. The sample was not provenienced to a specific
elevation but rather to a range of 40-50 centimeters below datum (101.010­
100.910). This sample was analyzed (Beta 212457) and produced a calibrated
radiocarbon date of 930-740 B.P., again, a clear indication of the intact nature
of the feature.

Figure 44: Unit 12, West Wall Profile

The 16 sediment samples collected from Feature 8/9 context (including column
samples from outside the main feature boundary) revealed a great deal about
the food and food preparation habits of the feature’s creators. According to Phil
Dering of Shumla Archeobotanical Services (See Appendix F), charred remnants
of three edible plant species were recovered from directly within Feature 8/9
levels including Hackberry (Celtis sp.), prickly pear (Opuntia sp.) and bulbs
(most likely wild onion). Hackberry fragments were recovered within Sample 35,
a column sample collected from the southeast corner of Level 2 (away from the
main feature), Sample 53, a bulk matrix sample recovered from beneath and
between the main feature rocks in the northwest corner of the feature, and
Sample 78, a bulk matrix sample collected from beneath the main feature rocks
within the basin stain. Prickly pear fragments were found within Sample 35 as
well. Nine charred bulb fragments were found in Sample 53 and Sample 72, a
humate sample recovered from the charcoal-stained sediment near the base of
the feature. In addition, mesquite fragments found within Samples 35, 40, 53,
62, 63, 72 and 78 provide clear evidence of the occupants’ fuel of choice (or at
least what was most readily available, see Appendix F).
Feature 8/9, like the abundant charcoal and stained sediment, contained a
large number of artifacts, specifically formal tools including two Ensor projectile
points (Unique Items 131-1 and 161-1). Ensor point 131-1 was observed in the
center of Unit 12’s Level 2, approximately 30 centimeters north of Feature 8 and
above the main Feature 8/9 burned rock cluster. The point lay in situ next to
one of the level’s two cores (Items 131-4 or 131-5; Figure 45). Item 161-1,
however, was found in more diagnostic settings. This point was located near the
center of the northern edge of Unit 12 at the top of Level 4 (40 cmbd/101.010).
According to Collins (2004:113), the consistency of Late Archaic, feature-related
points that predate the overlapping Late Prehistoric radiocarbon dates (940-690

Archeological Mitigation – UV68 – July 2007

Feature Discussions

B.P.) by approximately 350-600 years is likely an indication of some form of
admixture; or excavation of the pit through the intact sediments of an older
occupation. The period of feature use clearly relates to Late Prehistoric Interval
and represents a prehistoric surface remnant overlying intact Transitional and
Late Archaic II deposits. Other tools recovered within feature levels include
bifaces and biface fragments, two pieces of groundstone, two unifaces and six
cores along with eight use wear and retouched flakes. The feature’s complement
of two pieces of groundstone marks a clear indication of plant processing at the
feature site. The presence of such a large number of cores is an indication that
this location was also intensively utilized for lithic reduction. Indeed the
feature’s debitage tally confirms this with more than 1.7 kilograms of debitage
from all feature levels (Table 15). Level 4 (101.010-100.910) marked the clear
occupational surface of Feature 8/9, retaining more than 500 grams.
Figure 45: Ensor Point In-situ in Feature 8/9

Overall, Feature 8/9 is defined as an intact, temporally-confined burned rock pit
dating to the Late Prehistoric. The dense scatter of burned rocks formed a
distinct and regular central basin feature near the northwestern corner of Unit
12. A secondary, much smaller basin with a base slab rock was also found
south of the main basin. In profile, burned rocks and soil staining form a clear
dip in relation to the main basin while sediment stains (roughly mimicking the
pattern of the burned rocks above) extend deeper into the soil column. This is
most likely the result of gradual leeching of rains through the sediments,
carrying the dark, charcoal sediments with it. Evidence of cooking was present
in the form of persistent and extensive dark soil staining and sediment
oxidation. Soil samples collected from within the feature context contained
evidence of charred hackberry, prickly pear and (wild onion) bulbs as well as a
preponderance of mesquite, providing clues of what they were eating and
burning to prepare their food. Charcoal collected from within direct featurerelated contexts both from the top and bottom of the feature produced strikingly
similar radiocarbon dates (ca. 900-700 B.P.), placing the functional use of the
feature in the early stages (Edwards) of the Late Prehistoric, while the feature’s

two diagnostic finds (two Ensor projectile points) are approximately 500 years
older, isolated to the later stages of the Late Archaic/Transitional Archaic. The
older points’ finds above the main feature elements indicate selective surface
collection of the older points during the later site occupation phases (see
Chapter 9.0) or excavation of the intensive pit into shallowly-buried sediments
of an older, intact occupation. Feature 8/9 is unique in this region, it is very
intact, very structurally and temporally sound and not common overall.

Stone Tools and Lithic Debris

9.0 STONE TOOLS AND LITHIC DEBRIS
During the data recovery phase of excavations at 41UV68, a significant sample
of lithic tools and manufacturing debris was recovered. The lithic assemblage
included projectile points, bifaces and biface fragments, unifaces, cores, edge
modified flakes, a small sample of ground and battered stone artifacts, and
debitage. In general the lithic assemblage from 41UV68 indicates that the
inhabitants were engaged in a broad spectrum of lithic manufacturing tasks as
well as other subsistence activities. Lithic technology was weighted toward
bifacial tools and reduction, though flake tools do constitute a sizable portion of
the assemblage. The assemblage remained consistently diverse through time in
terms of tool types present, and it lacks evidence for a specialized tool
production associated with activity specialization.
Temporally diagnostic artifacts recovered from the site suggest a period of
occupation that spanned the Middle Archaic period through at least the Austin
Phase of the Late Prehistoric. However, the combination of site stratigraphy,
radiometric dating of excavation contexts, and the vertical distribution of known
projectile point styles, strongly suggests that the majority of the excavation
contexts from the mitigation investigations sampled a primarily Late Archaic II,
Transitional Archaic and Late Prehistoric occupation zone concentrated in the
upper 40 centimeters of site deposits in the A horizon stratum. Though
projectile point styles from the Late Archaic II and Transitional Archaic through
the Austin phase of the Late Prehistoric are present, and radiocarbon dating
suggests a basically intact stratigraphy, within the deposits it was impossible to
isolate different lenses of material in the A horizon. Only in Unit 8 was there
strong evidence for a remnant of an earlier period occupation in the upper 10 to
20 centimeters of the B-horizon. The B-horizon may date as early as the Middle
Archaic based on the recovery of Nolan type dart points from this unit, but the
radiocarbon dating of a single charcoal fragment from Unit 8 returned a Late
Archaic date of 3340-3070 B.P. Furthermore, it appears that there was some
mixing of deposits at the interface of the A and B horizon deposits. As a result,
for the purposes of the analysis, the lithic assemblage from the occupation zone
spanning the A and B horizon is treated as a single analytical unit with
observable variation in the vertical distribution of artifacts considered an
indication of relatively intact stratigraphy.
The remainder of this chapter is organized in the following manner. First, a
summary overview and description of the lithic assemblage by artifact class is
provided.
Additional artifact data and discussion of the methodological
procedures are presented in Appendix A. The descriptive data is followed by a
brief discussion of resource utilization. Finally, an overview and discussion of
the lithic assemblage from the site is given. This final section is particularly
concerned with the inferences that can be drawn concerning site type, local
lithic technology traditions and the sorts of activities the occupants carried out
at 41UV68 in relation to other temporally comparable sites in the region.

9.1

ARTIFACT DESCRIPTIONS
As stated in the introduction, the lithic tool assemblage from the mitigation
excavations is relatively diverse in terms of having projectile points, bifaces,
unifaces, groundstone tools, edge modified flakes and cores. Bifacial tools were
the most common type of formal tool recovered during the mitigation phase of
excavations at 41UV68. Only a small portion of the collection recovered from

Archeological Mitigation – UV68 – July 2007

105

Stone Tools and Lithic Debris

excavations – three bifaces, two unifaces, and three cores from Unit 8 – were
collected from deposits other than A horizon deposits. A small portion of the
collection, primarily projectile points, was also collected from surface contexts or
during the trenching phase of excavations.
9.1.1

Projectile Points
The 14 projectile points recovered during the excavations consist of styles that
span central Texas prehistory from the Middle Archaic through the Austin phase
of the Late Prehistoric. Of these specimens, five were collected from the surface
and the remainder from subsurface archeological deposits (Table 19). From
intact site deposits three Late Archaic II, Ensor dart points and a Late
Prehistoric Edwards arrow point were recovered from the A horizon occupation
zone. A fourth Ensor point was found on the surface and a Frio dart point was
recovered in Unit 13, but from disturbed context. With the exception of two
Nolan points from the lower A/upper B horizons in Unit 8 and a possible
Marcos-Castroville from A horizon deposits in Unit 10, the small collection of
Late Archaic dart points was recovered from the surface.
Finally two
miscellaneous projectile points were recovered from the surface and a third from
A horizon deposits in Unit 11.
Before providing an overview of the different projectile points recovered, several
other aspects of the projectile collection merit mention. First, it is notable that
excepting the Nolan-like base from Unit 8, level 4, all projectile points recovered
are finished artifacts, and no projectile point preforms were identified. From this
observation it can be suggested that site activity was not focused on projectile
point production. This is interesting in comparison to other investigated
Transitional Archaic and Late Prehistoric sites in the region where projectile
point production seems to have been a major emphasis (see Creel and Goode
1997; Hester 1971; Houk and Lohse 1993). Heat treating is relatively rare
among the specimens, with only one intact specimen– an Ensor dart (Unique
Item 161-1) – having characteristics of heat treating. The other three specimens
exhibiting evidence of heat treatment are all fragments, and it is unclear
whether thermal alteration of the material occurred before or after the discard of
these artifacts. Finally, several of the specimens are patinated. The presence or
absence of patination on these artifacts does not have strict temporal correlates
– Late Archaic and Transitional Archaic specimens both show patination – but it
does appear that projectile points from undisturbed contexts do not exhibit
patinated surfaces. Thus it can be posited that artifacts from intact contexts are
being subjected to different environmental effects than those that are patinated,
and thus have differing post-depositional life histories. Indeed, as will be
discussed below, the correlation between the reworking of artifacts and
patination may be a hallmark of the collection of artifacts from other sites or
within the 41UV68 site boundary for reuse by the inhabitants, similar to that
observed for the Austin Phase occupants of 41UV86 (Creel and Goode
1997:229).
Edwards (n=1)
Though Austin Phase Late Prehistoric radiocarbon dates were returned from A
horizon occupation zone contexts in Units 11 and 12, the only Austin Phase Late
Prehistoric point recovered was a complete Edwards point (Unique Item 244-3;
Figure 46). This specimen closely matches the type description in Turner and
Hester (1999:212). The blade is triangular with straight lateral edges exhibiting
a slight serration from flake removals. The recurved base is markedly expanding
and the abrupt shoulder barbs are formed from corner notching. Typical of

most arrow points, this specimen appears manufactured on a flake, but it does
exhibit full bifacial working. This specimen does not appear macroscopically to
have been utilized or resharpened (Stage 3). This artifact was recovered from
Unit 11, Level 3 in association with a possible pit feature (Feature 7/22) and two
additional projectile points: an Ensor (Unique Item 244-2) and a miscellaneous
form tentatively assigned to the Transitional Archaic (Unique Item 244-1).

Ensor (N=4)
The most frequently recovered projectile points from excavation contexts were
Ensor points, three of which were recovered from A horizon deposits in Units 11
and 12 (Unique Items 244-2, 131-1, 161-1) and one on the site surface (Unique
Item 121-1; Figure 47). Ensor points are a small triangular dart point,
generally identified by the presence of a broad flat base and shallow side
notching, and are considered to date to the Transitional Archaic (A.D. 200-600)
or possibly later (Turner and Hester 1999:114). All of the 41UV68 examples are
side notched with flat bases and are bifacially worked. With the exception of
Unique Item 244-2, which only retains the base and lower blade and is very
burned and damaged, the remaining three specimens are relatively intact. The
intact specimens all exhibit altered edge angles indicative of resharpening.
Unique Item 131-1 from Unit 12, Level 2 is particularly notable because the
base is formed by a possible burin removal to flatten it. The other specimens
have thinned and chipped flat bases. This curious basal form on Unique Item
131-1 may indicate that this specimen was manufactured on a broken biface, or
has been rejuvenated through basal reworking. Though radiocarbon dates from
Units 11 and 12 where the Ensors were recovered are all Late Prehistoric in

date, post dating the accepted age of the style, the intrusive nature of the
associated pit features likely resulted in mixing of temporally discrete
components. Radiometric dates from A horizon contexts in Units 8 and 9
spanning 2140-1410 B.P. are more likely to correspond to these points as this
period of time has been associated with this style.

Frio (n=1)
A single Frio style projectile point fragment (Unique Item 206-1) was recovered
from Unit 13 (Figure 48). This unit had significant evidence for disturbance

Archeological Mitigation – UV68 – July 2007

108

Stone Tools and Lithic Debris

and this particular point is not believed to be in an intact archeological context.
The specimen is patinated and a basal/medial fragment. The base matches the
classic Frio shape with side notches forming the stem and a markedly expanding
concave base with upturned ears (Turner and Hester 1999:122). Temporally it
fits well into the 2140-1410 B.P. dates in Units 8 and 9. What distinguishes
this specimen from the similar aged Ensor dart points is the presence of surface
patination and the apparent reutilization of the distal end as a possible scraping
tool. Other Transitional Archaic (Hester 1999) or Late Archaic II (Collins 2004)
points from intact contexts are unpatinated and none exhibited signs of
reutilization. On the other hand, Late Archaic dart points from the surface are
patinated and reworked. It seems likely then that this specimen may have been
collected by later site inhabitants and reutilized. The presence of surface
patination on an object recovered between 10 and 20 centimeters below the
surface also likely reflects mixing associated with disturbance in this portion of
the site.

150-2), Montell (UI # 239-1), and Frio (UI # 206-1)

Pedernales (n=1)
A single Pedernales fragment (Unique Item 122-1) was collected from the surface
of the site (Figure 48). This specimen is patinated and heavily resharpened and
reworked. Though the distal tip, barbs and portions of the blade are missing, it
still retains the classic Pedernales base and stem (Turner and Hester 1999:171­
173). The stem is rectangular and straight with a bifurcated base made by
removing a flute-like flake from one side of the base. One lateral edge has been
burinated, destroying the blade edge. The other side of the blade is heavily
altered above the shoulder. This alteration is in the form of relatively wide flakes
removed from one side leaving a steeply angled edge. Tiny flakes and nicking
along this reworked edge suggest it has been utilized, likely as an expedient
scraper or cutting tool. Pedernales points are generally dated to the Late
Archaic I interval (Collins 2004:113).

Archeological Mitigation – UV68 – July 2007

109

Stone Tools and Lithic Debris

Marcos-Castroville (n=1)
A possible Marcos-Castroville dart point fragment (Unique Item 150-2) was
recovered from A horizon deposits during the excavation of Unit 10, Level 3
(Figure 48). Because of the extensive damage, the item is difficult to orient and
the typing tentative, but discussion assumes that the artifact should be oriented
in the manner shown in Figure 48. The typing of Unique Item 150-2 is based
on a deep corner notch present on this large dart point fragment. The intact
lateral edge is finely worked with broad flakes. Most of the body of the artifact
appears to be damaged either as a result of heating – the material is reddish in
color and waxy – or intentional flaking. It is notable that the broad, thin flaking
is similar to that observed on the previously described Pedernales fragment as
well as a Miscellaneous Late Archaic dart point fragment found on the surface
(Unique Item 124-1, see below).
Montell (n=1)
Unique Item 239-1 is a patinated dart point fragment recovered from the site
surface that has basal characteristics that suggest that it should be classified as
a Montell dart point (Turner and Hester 1999:157; Figure 48). Montell dart
points are generally associated with the Late Archaic I period, a span of time
basically consistent with radiocarbon dates from Unit 8 and 9. Though the stem
is essentially missing from this fragment, there are clearly two preserved stem
elements separated by a deep notch. Based on the orientation of the stem
remnants and the notch, it is believed that this artifact would have possessed
the expanding stem with a V-shaped notch that typifies a Montell point. The
distal tip is missing and the intact lateral blade edge has nicking and small flake
removals characteristic of use wear. The other blade edge, however, is broken
and appears to have been reworked into a steeply angled unifacial edge. Thus it
appears that this Late Archaic specimen was reutilized by the site inhabitants,
like the other described specimens.
Nolan and Nolan-like (n=2)
A Nolan style projectile point (Unique Item 213-1) and a Nolan-like basal
fragment (Unique Item 229-1) were both recovered in Unit 8 contexts (Figure
49). Nolan points are recognized by the presence of strong alternate beveling of
the rectangular stem (Turner and Hester 1999:164). Both specimens have this
characteristic. Unique Item 213-1 is a broken but relatively complete specimen
that is finished and exhibits beveling on the blade as well, suggesting
resharpening. The other specimen, Unique Item 229-1, is only a base but
strongly beveled. However, the chipping is relatively crude and the point may
have been broken during manufacture and discarded. Typically, Nolan points
are assigned to the Middle Archaic period (Collins 2004:113). At 41UV68 the
complete specimen was found in the A horizon in a level dated to 1170-970 B.P.,
clearly much later than the traditionally accepted date for Nolan points. As a
result it seems likely this specimen is in a disturbed context or was recycled by
later site inhabitants. The basal fragment, however, was recovered in the B
horizon deposits. A charcoal sample collected from the same strata returned a
2-sigma calibrated date of 3340-3070 B.P. (Sample 52). This date is still later
than generally accepted Nolan point dates, but more in line than that associated
with the other specimen. Thus, it seems likely that Nolan points at this site
either occur much later in time than generally accepted, that earlier site
inhabitants utilized Nolan points and this occupation is poorly preserved in any
of the excavation units, or that later site occupants collected and utilized these
types of points from Middle Archaic occupations within the site or from
neighboring sites. Given the recovery of several Late Archaic points from the

Archeological Mitigation – UV68 – July 2007

110

Stone Tools and Lithic Debris

surface, in excavation units and the compressed nature of the site deposits, a
combination of these last two propositions seems the most tenable.
Figure 49: Nolan (213-1) and Nolan-like (229-1) Dart Points

Miscellaneous Projectile Points
Misc. Transitional Archaic (n=1)
In Unit 11 a small lanceolate form (Unique Item 244-1) with weak shoulders, a
straight stem and a deep basal concavity was recovered in the same level as an
Ensor (Unique Item 244-2) and an Edwards (Unique Item 244-3; Figure 50).
The size and basic outline fall within the parameters of a Darl type projectile
point (Turner and Hester 1999:101), but this specimen seems too thick and
crudely made to be comfortably classed within this type. The specimen is
interesting in having extensive blade resharpening resulting in a “twist” to the
body. The distal end has been extensively resharpened and possibly reworked
into a perforator type bit.
Miscellaneous Late Archaic (n=2)
Two expanding stem projectile points (Unique Items 123-1 and 124-1) were
recovered from surface contexts at the site, but neither was able to be typed
using current typologies (Figure 50). Based on their overall size and expanding
bases, these artifacts have been provisionally identified as Late Archaic artifacts.
Though poorly represented by site contexts except in Unit 8, these artifacts may
have originated in now deflated site contexts in the area of the mitigation, or
from other areas of the site. Unique Item 123-1 is a triangular blade with weak,
rounded shoulders and an expanding stem with a shallow concave base. Some
minor alteration of the lateral edge angles suggests resharpening. Unique Item
124-1 is a longitudinally split specimen that is hard to orient (though the
description assumes orientation in Figure 50 is correct). The intact portion of
the stem and base indicates a bifurcated base with rectangular ears. The blade
is broad and leaf shaped. Examination of the tools is suggestive that the artifact

Archeological Mitigation – UV68 – July 2007

111

Stone Tools and Lithic Debris

has been flaked subsequent to being finished, with broad thin flakes removed
from the blade that do not match the small fine flaking that appears to be the
result of finishing on the base and portions of the blade. These broad, thin flake
scars resemble those observed on the previously described Pedernales and
Marcos-Castroville points.

Bifaces
Bifaces and biface fragments were recovered from all excavation contexts (Table
20). In general, bifaces were concentrated in the A horizon deposits, but three
were found in Unit 8 B horizon deposits. Six specimens, two fragments and four
complete bifaces, were recovered from the surface or backhoe trench contexts.
Bifaces and biface fragments were analyzed using a life history approach, with
an emphasis on identifying their place within an idealized progression from
unmodified resource to finished tool (see Appendix A for full discussion). As a
result, all specimens were described as belonging to one of four possible stages:
Stage 1 – initial shaping; Stage 2 - fine shaping and thinning, Stage 3 – a
finished unutilized artifact, and Stage 4 - a finished and utilized biface. Based
on the staging of the artifacts, all stages of biface manufacture and use are
represented, suggesting that site inhabitants were engaged in the manufacture
and use of these tools on site over the course of the site history. Below, biface
descriptions are presented by stage. More detailed individual artifact data is
presented in Appendix A.
Stage 1 Bifaces (n=9)
Stage 1 bifaces are represented by nine specimens (Figure 51). There are
several aspects of the collection worthy of note. First is the lack of any Stage 1
fragments. This is probably due in part to the intentional discard of poor quality
materials in the reduction process. In this regard six of the recovered Stage 1
specimens are of a coarse grained chert and two are of fine grained material with

crystalline occlusions. The only fine grained specimen without obvious material
flaws is Unique Item 195-2, which was apparently unable to be thinned across
the middle of the artifact. Of the collection only one specimen (Unique Item 208­
1) was manufactured on a flake. The remaining eight examples are all bifacially
reduced cobbles. Equally interesting is evidence of use wear on at least two of

the bifaces (Unique Items 112-1 and 244-4) and possibly a third (Unique Item
203-1). Though it is uncertain what tasks may have been conducted with the
tools – most exhibit macroscopically visible unifacial use wear - clearly they
continued to be viewed as functional objects even if they were deemed
unsuitable for further reduction and refinement. None of the specimens exhibit
evidence of heat treatment.
Stage 2 Bifaces (n=12)
Stage 2 bifaces and fragments were the most frequently represented bifaces
(n=12/38%) in the collection with four complete Stage 2 bifaces and eight biface
fragments recovered during data recovery (Figure 52).
The collection of
complete bifaces includes two examples that are ovate in outline, one triangular
specimen and one with an indeterminate shape that does not fit the basic
outline typology. Of the eight fragments, three are proximal pieces, two are
distal, two are lateral, and another is a combination lateral and proximal break.
Though no comprehensive study of break types was conducted, it seems likely
that many of the Stage 2 biface fragments are manufacturing errors. In this
regard, it is interesting that compared to the Stage 1 bifaces that are
overwhelming coarse grained chert, the Stage 2 bifaces and fragments are
overall fine grained material. Nor is it clear in most cases why the intact Stage 2
bifaces were “unfinished”. Interestingly, all four complete specimens (Unique
Items 118-1, 133-1, 203-2, 254-4) and four fragments (Unique Items 125-1,
133-2, 169-2, 244-10) exhibited evidence for use wear, indicating that these
unrefined bifaces were not simply manufacturing rejects or failures, but served
as functional tools. However they may have been expedient in the sense that
they were not curated by the site occupants. A total of six of the Stage 2
specimens (Unique Items 125-1, 133-1, 133-2, 177-1, 244-10, 254-4) exhibited
thermal alteration.
Figure 52: Stage 2 Bifaces and Biface Fragments

Stone Tools and Lithic Debris

Stage 4 Bifaces (n=11)
Stage 4 bifaces, or bifaces that exhibit a finished appearance and evidence for
utilization as a tool, made up 34% (n=11) of the biface collection. Of the eleven
examples recovered from the site, nine were fragments and two were intact
(Figure 53). This ratio of intact to broken specimens is the lowest of the staged
collections. Of the two complete examples, one is lanceolate (Unique Item 119-2)
and the other (Unique Item 204-4) is ovate in outline. Surprising in light of the
abandoned coarse and medium grained Stage 1 bifaces, two of the specimens
are manufactured on a coarse grained chert, four on medium grained chert and
the remaining five on fine grained chert.
This suggests that prehistoric
knappers at the site favored finer grained materials, but chert quality did not
apriori determine whether the material was selected or not. Not surprisingly, all
of the specimens exhibited either use wear and/or resharpening. Resharpening
was observed on five of the artifacts (Unique Items 119-2, 164-1, 171-5, 257-1,
204-4). Of these the resharpening resulted in the creation of an alternate bevel
on three (Unique Items 119-2, 171-5, 204-4) and a one edge bevel on another
(Unique Item 164-1). The biface fragments were more often proximal ends (n=4),
though distal fragments (n=2), a medial fragment and a combination break
fragment were all recovered from the site. Heat alteration was observed on three
Stage 4 biface fragments (Unique Items 120-1, 213-2, 204-2).

9.1.3

Unifaces
There were 15 unifaces recovered from 41UV68 excavation contexts. Unifaces
are classified as artifacts that show significant alteration of the original shape of
the material in order to form the artifact, generally to create a steeply angled
working bit, though several thin unifaces have been identified in this collection
that lack the steeply angled bit. In the excavation units, unifaces were most
concentrated in the A horizon deposits of Units 8, 11, and 12 (Table 21), but

unifaces were also found more widely distributed including two recovered in B
horizon deposits in Unit 8.
The majority of the unifaces are primary and secondary flakes (10 of 15/66.6%),
and overwhelming exhibit primarily dorsal modification (Figure 54). During the
analysis, these artifacts were further sorted by “functional-descriptive”
categories based on the location of the apparent working bit into the following
categories: endscraper (n=2), sidescraper (n=8), combination scrapers (n=4), and
an indeterminate specimen. There does not appear to be any direct correlation
between vertical and horizontal distribution of these artifacts and the most likely
explanation for the difference is the preferred working edge of the tool, not a
specific functional application. One interesting specimen, Unique Item 171-1,
has a series of three concavities along one edge that are approximately seven
millimeters wide each. Unique Item 251-1 has a potential graver spur along the
distal edge. One example, Unique Item 244-7, is large, thick and triangular core
fragment that has been reshaped and utilized unifacially along one edge. It is
very similar to a specimen described as a “core chopper” illustrated in the
41UV21 report (Hester 1971:87), but the working bit has not been bifacially
thinned.
Within the collection four of the specimens exhibited heat treatment (Unique
Items 131-2, 131-3, 244-6, 251-1). In all four cases the specimens are from
Units 11 and 12, both units with burned rock features. Thus heat treatment
may be an aspect of heating after discard, not intentional modification of the
chert for the purposes of knapping. Though all specimens exhibited some form
of at least minimal edge damage associated with use, six unifaces showed signs
of edge resharpening (Unique Items 131-2, 131-3, 135-4, 143-1, 195-5, 251-1).
In fact Unique Item 204-1 is the edge of uniface that has been removed,
presumably to resharpen the artifact’s working edge.
This data strongly
suggests that unifaces were likely being utilized and resharpened on site, though
to what end is unclear.
9.1.4

Edge Modified Flakes
Edge modified flakes, though often exhibiting unifacial use wear or modification,
are flakes that served as tools, but were utilized without intentional reshaping of
the original flake form (Figure 55). Modifications to the edges are interpreted as
occurring as a result of the type of use to which it was applied or to resharpen or

116

Stone Tools and Lithic Debris

Figure 55: Edge Modified Flakes

slightly modify the flake in order to better use the tool. Thus the basic definition
is further subdivided into use wear flakes and retouched flakes. Use wear flakes
show indications of edge modification such as nicking, dulling or polishing along
an edge, but none of this modification results from intentional and systematic
human modification of the tool edge itself. Retouched flakes on the other hand
do exhibit intentional and systematic modification of the flake edges, but not so

Archeological Mitigation – UV68 – July 2007

117

Stone Tools and Lithic Debris

significant as to warrant their inclusion in the category of uniface. This
definition is admittedly subjective, and certain artifacts do blur this distinction.
Thirty-five edge modified flakes were recovered from all units, except Unit 13
(Table 22). The lack of recovery in Unit 13 is the result of the debitage not being
sorted owing to the demonstrated disturbance of the unit. Though collected from
all units, edge modified flakes were only recovered from A horizon deposits. The
highest concentrations of edge modified flakes in the excavation units was in the
upper 20 centimeters of Unit 8 where four retouched and 10 use wear flakes
were recovered in numbers unparalleled in the other units.
The other
concentration of edge modified flakes was in Test Unit 12 in the general area of
Feature 8/9. A total of seven edge modified flakes were recovered in association
with the feature. This concentration may indicate that they were used for
processing vegetal materials associated with the pit oven, as it is widely accepted
that these types of expedient tools are often discarded in their locus of use
(Black and McGraw 1985:75). The possible Late Prehistoric Austin interval
association of these artifacts is also relevant as this period is widely viewed in
the region as being increasingly focused on expedient flake technologies.

Cores
Cores are pieces of lithic source material that only exhibit evidence of negative
flake scars indicating flake removals. Cores are understood to have served
primarily as parent material for the production of other lithic tool forms and
flakes. Though cores can be considered a form of debitage (Black and McGraw
1985:62), their use and the types of cores present on a site can provide insight
into site function and local technological practice. At 41UV68 a total of 27 cores
were recovered from all test units except Unit 13 from which no cores were
recovered (Table 23, Figure 56). While core technology is prevalent at the site,
there is no indication of a specialized core technology. In other words, there is a
distinct lack of evidence for a focused approach to flake production as might be
expected from a core technology oriented to producing blades or other specific
flake forms. Indeed, if one were to characterize the core technology, the most
meaningful observation would be that the greater number of bifacial cores may

suggest that the core and biface technology are not mutually exclusive. This
further underscores the overall bifacial orientation to the lithic technology. A
final item worth mentioning in the discussion on cores is the relatively high
number of “tested cobbles”. Cores with six or less flake scars and a significant
amount of cortex were identified as being cobbles that were initially tested for
the quality of material but were abandoned. In the collection 11 of the 27
specimens (41%) were classified as such. This high recovery of tested cobbles
may reflect conscious decisions on the part of the site inhabitants to not utilize
the material, or it may reflect an uneven recovery of used versus abandoned
cores. The recovery of 16 small core fragments in the debitage may also be
interpreted to indicate that other cobbles were worked until exhausted and thus
effectively archeologically invisible.
All of the cores appeared to be cobbles, likely recovered from nearby gravel
deposits, and the quality of the material varied from fine grained materials to

Stone Tools and Lithic Debris

coarse materials with various occlusions. Cores within the collection were
classified according to the manner and direction in which flakes were removed.
Cores with evidence of flake removal from a single edge in a unidirectional
manner – unidirectional cores – were found to constitute seven specimens of the
collection (Unique Items 112-4, 131-4, 131-5, 171-2, 173-1, 213-3). Of this
collection, five have six or fewer flakes removed; an observation that suggests
that many of these are essentially cobbles that were tested. However, reasons
for abandonment of these cores are not clear. Two of the specimens are fine
grained chert, and the others are coarse or medium grained and often have
occlusions. However, the more utilized cores (Unique Items 131-4 and 242-2)
were from medium and variegated grained cobbles respectively.
Bidirectional cores made up a small component of the core assemblage,
accounting for only three examples: Unique Items 195-6, 213-5, 257-2. All three
specimens had flakes removed from two perpendicular edges. Specimen 195-6
was a medium grained chert cobble with only four flake removals suggesting this
is a tested cobble. The other two, 213-5 and 257-2, were coarse and medium
grained respectively. Specimen 257-2 is particularly interesting because it is
lightly patinated with the appearance of a unidirectional blade core (the flake
scar average is “blade-like” at a 2.08 to 1 length to width ratio), except for the
removal of flakes from an edge perpendicular to the edge that looks like a blade
removal edge. This may be a reutilized artifact.
Multidirectional cores made up a significant percent of the sample (26%) with
seven specimens. These cores had flake removals emanating from more than
two edges of the core. Two of these – Unique Items 135-3 and 254-2 – had four
or fewer flake removals suggesting they are tested cobbles, not intensively
utilized cores. The remainder ranged from eight flake removals (Unique Item
204-6) to as high as 20 (Unique Item 251-3) with a mean of 14 flake removals for
the examples not considered tested cobbles. The core with the highest flake
removal count is Unique Item 251-3 with 20. Interestingly it is also the only
multidirectional core that is of a fine grained, high quality chert. The presence
of a crystalline occlusion however, seems to have hampered flaking.
The most common type of core was the bifacial core. Bifacial cores have flakes
removed bifacially from a single or multiple edges. No doubt several of these
examples may have been initially reduced with the intention of manufacturing a
bifacial tool, but were abandoned early in the process due to material flaws or
other considerations on the part of the knapper. Three of the specimens are
classified as tested cobbles for having six or less flake scars (Unique Items 139­
2, 220-1, 220-2), though specimen 220-2 is actually a large flake that has been
flaked. This same specimen appears to have been utilized as a tool as well, as
one flake platform edge has modification of the edge consistent with use as a
chopping tool as well as polishing of the ventral face behind the damage. The
remaining bifacial cores have between 11 and 18 flake scars. Most are of coarse
or medium grained cherts, often with occlusions.
Finally, one specimen (Unique Item 244-8) was a thermally altered medium
grained chert cobble with five flake removals. It was classified as an
indeterminate core owing to the damaged condition of the artifact which made it
difficult to determine the directionality of the flake scars.
As noted at the beginning of this section, the distribution of cores at the site is
relatively wide spread, with the majority recovered from the A horizon between
20 and 50 centimeters below surface. This zone is dated from the Late II,
Archeological Mitigation – UV68 – July 2007

121

Stone Tools and Lithic Debris

Transitional Archaic through the Austin Interval of the Late Prehistoric, and the
cores associated with this are likely debris from the site occupation during this
period. Only two specimens (Unique Items 112-3 and 112-4) were collected from
the site surface. Specimens 242-2, 254-1, and 254-3 from Levels 5 and 6 in Unit
8 are the only cores associated with the B horizon.
There is a more notable horizontal pattern to the distribution of cores. Eighteen
of 27 cores (67%), are from Units 8 (n=11) and 12 (n=7). These same units and
levels also had the highest numbers of other tool types and manufacturing
debris. It is possible that these two locations were both sites of more intensive
lithic production, particularly biface production, during the occupation of this
portion of the site.
9.1.6

Ground and Battered Stone
Ground and battered stone was recovered in very low quantities at the site.
During the course of the investigations seven chert and limestone specimens
were collected as possible ground or battered stone (Table 24). Of these, only
two – Unique Items 141-2 and 195-7 – were subsequently analyzed and found to
possess characteristics that indicated that these were items that had served the
prehistoric site inhabitants as grinding or battering tools (Figure 57). The
remaining five items (Unique Items 135-1, 139-3, 141-3, 171-3, 171-4) were
examined macroscopically for evidence of use as grinding or battering tools, but
were found to lack any obvious signs of intentional human modification.

Specimen 141-2 is a burned piece of limestone that is badly fractured. It has
one intact face that is smooth from grinding. Based on the convex curvature of
the smoothed area and the relatively small size of the intact portion of the
artifact (5.8 x 4.6 x 3.1 cm), it seems likely to have served as a mano for
grinding. Recovered from Test Unit 10, Level 2, the fracturing and burning of

the artifact indicate that it was heated, and it may have served as a hearth
stone, though it is unclear if this occurred before or after breaking.
The only other convincing non-chipped stone artifact was Unique Item 195-7,
collected in Level 1 of Unit 8. This artifact is the rounded end of a broken
limestone cobble. The end is heavily battered and a thin (1 mm) layer of stone
has been exfoliated as a result. The observation that no other portion of this
small cobble exhibits this same damage suggests that it was intentionally
utilized to batter either other rocks as a hammerstone, or perhaps bone to
extract marrow.
The lack of more evidence for ground stone tools is somewhat surprising given
the presence of at least one burned rock pit oven and the presence of plenty of
available limestone or chert cobbles. Given that the macrobotanical results (see
Chapter 10, Appendix C) indicate that Feature 8/9 was being utilized to
process all or some of the following plants – hackberry seeds, prickly pear, and
onion bulbs – there is an expectation for the recovery of grinding tools. Their
absence may in part stem from the use of plants that do not benefit from
processing with ground stone tool forms such as manos and metates. Ground
tools are also scarce at other sites in the region (Creel and Goode 1997:233;
Houk and Lohse 1993:216-217) and this lack may be an aspect of the general
tool assemblage associated with hunter gatherers in this portion of Texas. Given
the availability of chert and limestone cobbles, grinding and or battering may
also have been accomplished without recourse to formal tools making their
identification difficult if they have not been heavily utilized and modified.
However, the use of wood tools that do not preserve in the archeological record
may also account for this pattern and such artifacts have been recovered from
south Texas (Hester and Collins 1968; Sullivan 1998:721).

9.1.7

Debitage
As the largest category of lithic artifact recovered at the site, debitage is
ubiquitous in all test units and on the surface of the site. While debitage was
recovered from all units, only debitage from Units 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 was
analyzed. Of the 2,604 pieces of analyzed debitage, 849 of pieces were broken
flakes and 1,755 unbroken. Debitage was also found in both A and B horizon
deposits, though generally concentrated in the lower portions of the A horizon.
Unfortunately the inability to distinguish distinct occupational episodes and the
necessary analytical compression of the site’s occupational episodes into a single
stratigraphic zone in most of the units meant that treatment of the debitage was
general and intended to answer several broad questions concerning site
activities. First, from the characteristics of the debitage assemblage, what can
be known about the types of knapping activities that were conducted on site? In
other words were the inhabitants engaged in limited activities such as tool
resharpening/finishing or resource testing and collection, or were they collecting
and manufacturing, using and discarding the tools here? Second, are there any
vertical or horizontal patterns of distribution that can be used to infer intrasite
variability in activity?
As illustrated in the Figures 58a-f, the debitage analysis indicates that the types
of debitage present in the units generally mirror that of the site as a whole. At
the site level, broken flakes are most numerous making up 32% of the collection.
This is followed by whole tertiary flakes that constitute 27% of the collection and
chert chunks which account for 26% of the lithic debitage. Secondary flakes are
the next most common type representing 12% of the collection and primary
flakes a minor 2% of the analyzed debitage. Finally, edge bite flakes and core
fragments account for a very small percentage of the collection at 2% and 1%
respectively. Though minor variation is present, particularly in the relative
percentages of broken flakes and chunks within the units, most units have
whole flake assemblages dominated by tertiary flakes and significantly smaller
percentages of secondary and primary flakes.

Results of the size grading (Figures 59a-e) also show a consistent pattern in
terms of recovery. Overall debitage counts are highest for the 1/4” size grade, a
pattern in part reflecting the presence of broken flakes and chunks, but also
indicating the higher recovery of smaller tertiary flakes likely associated with the
later stages of tool manufacture. Given the use of 1/4” screen in the field, the
low 1/8” recovery is not representative of the frequency of smaller flakes in the
assemblage, but a consequence of the field methodology. That flakes this small
are being recovered at all, suggests that very small flakes, probably associated
with late stage tool thinning and resharpening, are indeed present and likely
underrepresented in the collection. Larger flakes are present in increasingly
lower numbers as one moves up the size grades from the 1/2” and 1” screens.
Interestingly, in all units but Unit 11, in the first level flakes recovered in the
1/2” are the most frequent. The cause for this is uncertain, but it may indicate
the effects of disturbance or deflation of the upper deposits. Broadly speaking
however, smaller flakes and debris are most commonly represented in the
collection. When broken down by flake type and size grade (Figures 60a-e)
tertiary flakes, not surprisingly, remain the most common type of whole flake.
In general the debitage analysis supports inferences about site activities and
lithic technology that can be deduced from the tool assemblage. First and
foremost, the debitage suggests that at least some lithic resources were brought
onto the site unprepared and then knapped. As discussed above, across the site
the recovery of primary, secondary and tertiary flakes is observed within the test
units, but tertiary flakes at much higher frequency. As proposed by authors
such as Collins (1975) and Patterson (1977), the basic assumption is that
knapping is a reductive technology and when working with materials with
cortex, the gradual reduction of the parent material will result in decreasing
amounts of cortex. Furthermore the occurrence of these types of flakes will be
conditioned by the organization of lithic procurement and manufacture, such
that a site where lithic resources are obtained and worked on site into finished

tools should demonstrate a higher ratio of primary and secondary flakes to
tertiary flake than one where only late stage finishing is being carried out
(Pecora 2001). A correlate to this trend is recognized in the general size of flakes
(Ahler 1989), where larger flakes tend to be associated with earlier stages of
reduction with increasingly smaller flake size as the work becomes finer and the
types of force applied shift from hard hammer to soft hammer to pressure
flaking techniques. Using these models as a general guide, at 41UV68 both the
cortical classification and the size grading suggest there is limited evidence for
the full reduction process occurring on site, but strong evidence for an emphasis
on the later stages of reduction. The low frequencies of secondary and primary
flakes suggest that initial reduction may be occurring at the source or at least
within spatially discrete areas at the site.
While the presence of small flakes, particularly secondary and tertiary, is a good
indicator of the likelihood of biface thinning, the presence of edge bite flakes
clearly indicates biface manufacture or maintenance. Support for such an
observation can also be drawn from the recovery of Stage 1 and 2 bifaces in the
excavation units and the relatively high number of bifacial cores. It is tempting
to overstate the importance of formal tool manufacturing debris within the
debitage assemblage, but it must not be forgotten that flake production was
equally important, given the evidence for retouched and use wear informal flake
tools and those tools made on flakes. The collected data, however, does not
make it evident to what degree biface or core reduction or tool and flake
production were being practiced relative to one another.

9.2

LITHIC RESOURCE UTILIZATION
Evidence for resource utilization indicates that locally available chert resources
were the primary material for lithic activity. Chert cobbles were readily available
to prehistoric inhabitants from both the bed of Cook’s Slough and outcropping
Uvalde gravels.
Exposed lag deposits of Uvalde gravels were recorded
immediately west of the project area during the survey phase of investigations
(Miller et. al. 2005:19). Trenching of the site during the early phase of
mitigation also identified gravel deposits shallowly buried in the southern
portions of the project area. An informal expression of the accessibility of chert
gravels is reflected in the common use of chert cobbles as components of the
burned rock features at the site. It can also be seen in the number of cores
abandoned on site. The quality of the material does appear to be relatively poor
based on the analysis of the cores and the bifaces. Given this apparent low
quality of material, it is interesting that a number of older projectile points made
of fine grain chert were recovered and appeared to be reworked. These artifacts
are likely objects that were collected by the site inhabitants from older exposed
deposits on site or from other sites in the vicinity. Creel and Goode (1997:229)
attribute similar recycling practices at 41UV86 to the desire to easily acquire
higher quality materials rather than work the locally available materials. It is
also notable that most of the reworked examples are patinated.
This
characteristic may be an indication that these artifacts were exposed for a
prolonged period on the surface and were thus easily available for collection.
This suggestion is admittedly tentative owing to these artifacts being primarily
surface finds at 41UV68, and the patination a post depositional condition
common to all surface finds on site. Indeed, patination among bifaces and
unifaces was also noted, but does not correlate to reutilization in the same
fashion as for the projectile points. As Frederick et al. (1994) observe, the
occurrence of patination on an artifact is only partially related to exposure and

time. The different constituent properties of the chert also have strong bearing
on how an individual artifact patinates. In this regard it is worth comment that
patination is present only on artifacts that are manufactured on finer grain,
higher quality material. Thus it might be the case that patination rates are
principally determined by material, not exposure. However, this cannot account
for tools manufactured on fine grain materials that lack patination.
Unfortunately these several possibilities cannot be answered conclusively with
the current site data. If it is assumed that the collection of these artifacts by site
occupants was related to material quality, however, it does indicate an
important aspect of local lithic procurement behavior that has been observed
elsewhere and may be part of a locally embedded tradition.

9.3

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
The lithic assemblage from the mitigation phase of excavations at 41UV68
reflects the timing and nature of the site occupations as well the inhabitants’
tradition of lithic technology. Overall, the lithic assemblage from the site
deposits is diverse in terms of tool forms and lithic manufacturing activities.
Though over 2000 years of occupation are indicated by the dating and
diagnostic tools collected on site, there is little difference in the overall character
of the assemblage in terms of vertical stratigraphy.
Though lithic manufacture is one activity clearly practiced at the site, the
relatively modest recovery of debitage alongside numerous utilized flake, bifacial
and unifacial, and ground stone tools underscores the point that tool
manufacture was only one of multiple activities carried out at the site. Though
contextual associations are for the most part lacking that would help to tie
specific tool types to particular activities, and the lack of use wear analysis of
the assemblage further compounds this difficulty, it can be surmised from other
sites and ethnographic comparisons that hunting of animals and the gathering
of local plant resources and their processing were all activities conducted on
site. The recovery of projectile points likely represents an important part of the
hunting tool kit, as well as weapons. The focus on bifaces may also be an
indication of the relative importance of hunting, as these tools are commonly
assumed to be tools used to butcher animals. Given the small number of bones
recovered at the site, hunting likely occurred off site and possibly butchering as
well, and biface production here may have been for use elsewhere along the lines
suggested by Tomka (2001). The presence of 15 utilized unifaces may suggest
that hide working was also being conducted on site, though other research has
shown that unifacial tools are multifunctional within Texas hunter gather
technological systems and thus may have been used as tools for cutting or
working wood for example (Prilliman and Bousmann 1998:631-632). Finally the
presence of a single limestone mano hints at the importance of processing plant
material at the site. Processing no doubt associated with the earth oven and
other documented burned rock features.
Based on the broad range of artifact types, the lithic assemblage suggests that
41UV68 was a generalized base camp at which a variety of activities were
conducted.
Furthermore, other aspects of the site assemblage including
manufacturing debris, expedient tools, and the presence of multiple burned rock
features, suggest that this site was occupied more intensively than other site
types such as lithic quarries or kill sites.

Stone Tools and Lithic Debris

Like most hunter-gatherer sites in central Texas, lithic tools and debris
constitute the bulk of the recovered materials. From the perspective of this site,
the local lithic technology was focused on bifacial tools relative to other tool
forms, an observation commonly interpreted as being a hallmark of relatively
mobile groups (Parry and Kelly 1987, but see Tomka 2001). Here bifacial tools,
generally considered to have functioned as knives, were manufactured, utilized,
and discarded at 41UV68. This pattern shows little evidence for variation over
time, though an increasing emphasis on expedient flake tools may be indicated
for the later occupation of the site. While there is ample evidence for biface
manufacture, projectile points, though present, do not appear to be a focus of
lithic manufacture here. Instead, biface production and to a lesser extent
uniface and flake tool production were the emphasis of knapping activities.
This diversity of tool types and the relative consistency of their recovery across
the site are very similar to the type of assemblage Hester (1971) describes for the
La Jita Site (41UV21). Like 41UV68, the Late Prehistoric component at 41UV21
had a diverse range of tool forms associated with it (Hester 1971:117). These
include projectile points – primarily Sabinal but also Edwards and Scallorn –
and bifaces, unifaces, flake tools, and ground stone as well as other more
specific forms. Analysis of the debitage was believed to indicate a possible
technological orientation towards flake blade production (Hester 1971:113).
Interestingly, Hester also notes a perceived lack of significant change in the
overall character of the lithic assemblage from the Archaic through Late
Prehistoric Interval (1971:113). His data is consistent with the data generated by
the 41UV68 lithic collection.
In contrast the Mingo Site (41BN101) and the Heard Schoolhouse Site (41UV86)
present much more restricted assemblages for their Transitional Archaic and
Austin Phase Late Prehistoric occupations. The Mingo Site has a Transitional
Archaic through Late Prehistoric Austin Phase occupation associated with a
small burned rock midden (Houk and Lohse 1993). At the Mingo Site (41BN101)
the lithic assemblage is heavily focused on the production of arrow points with
some bifaces and unifaces and edge modified flakes (Houk and Lohse 1993:215­
216).
Two pieces of groundstone were also recovered (Houk and Lohse
1993:216-217). Though 21 arrow point performs were found (Houk and Lohse
1993:210-212), and the full spectrum of debitage was present, the lack of many
primary flakes was believed to indicate that early stage reduction was practiced
elsewhere offsite or perhaps elsewhere within the site (Houk and Lohse
1993:222).
At the Heard Schoolhouse Site (41UV86), this pattern of arrow point and flake
tool production focus in the lithic assemblage is even better represented for the
Late Prehistoric Austin Phase occupation. At this site, the authors point out
that the “Austin phase assemblage is striking in its lack of diversity” (Creel and
Goode 1997:232). Though a large number of arrow points and preforms were
found, there is a notable lack of scrapers (typical of many Archaic and Toyah
sites in the region) or perforators or engravers or ground stone tools (Creel and
Goode 1997:233). Perhaps even more surprising is the lack of a tradition of fine
bifacial tool manufacture. As the authors state, “at the Heard Schoolhouse site,
rather than bifaces, large flake knives, either trimmed or not, served as the
primary cutting tools” (Creel and Goode 1997:233).
The lack of a true biface industry at the Heard Schoolhouse is very different
than what was encountered at 41UV68. As is the apparent focus on projectile
point production at that site and the Mingo and La Jita Sites. Though

Stone Tools and Lithic Debris

speculative, it bears some consideration what might be the significance of these
patterns for an understanding of the local archeology. One explanation may be
that the similarities in tool diversity of the La Jita and 41UV68 assemblages
indicates differences in the lithic assemblages between sites associated with site
function or season. While this may be applicable to the differences in the
evidence for projectile points manufacture, it does not account well for the very
different technological focus seen between the discussed sites.
While these sites may have as of yet unknown functional aspects that influence
the assemblage, all of the sites discussed have at least incipient, if not very large
burned rock middens and other stone hearth features and are interpreted as
being parts of a generalized campsite. The more convincing possibility is that
there is a shift in technological focus from the Transitional Archaic through
Austin Phase of the Late Prehistoric Interval toward flake tools as suggested by
Creel and Goode (1997:233). In this regard, the assemblage at 41UV68 can
contribute to the general understanding of Texas archeology by contributing to a
more robust database on local traditions of lithic technology in central Texas,
particularly the period spanning the Transitional Archaic through Late
Prehistoric intervals.

ORGANIC RECOVERY
The data recovery excavations at 41UV68 recovered only a limited amount of
plant remains and faunal material that corresponded to the prehistoric
occupation of the site. All of the material discussed in this chapter was
recovered from within an occupation zone that is situated within the upper 40­
60 centimeters of the site deposits associated with the A horizon. Dating of this
zone suggests that it pertains primarily to the Late Archaic II, Transitional
Archaic through the Austin Phase of the Late Prehistoric period. Though limited
in size, the information derived from the analysis of these remains provides
important data for an understanding of the site and the regional archeology.
The 33 pieces of recovered bone were submitted to LeeAnna Schnieb for faunal
analysis, the results of which are presented in Appendix B. Of the 61 sediment
samples collected, 32 were selected for macrobotanical analysis by Phil Dering,
the results of which are presented in Appendix E. The remainder of this
chapter summarizes the results of the faunal and floral analysis in terms of their
contextual associations and what they can contribute to an understanding of
the lifeways of the site inhabitants.

10.1 FAUNAL
The data recovery excavations at 41UV68 recovered only a small amount of
animal bone and mussel shell. The mussel shell was recovered in Level 1 in
Unit 8 from disturbed contexts. It consisted of only one gram of shell fragments,
and because of disturbance in this level, it cannot be positively assigned to
prehistoric activities at the site. The remaining bone material was, however,
recovered from an intact archeological context.
The bone consisted of 33 fragmented pieces, all of which were recovered from
Levels 4 and 5 (40-60 centimeters below datum/101.0103-100.8103) in Feature
8/9 in Unit 12 (Table 25). Feature 8/9 was a large pit hearth, charcoal samples
from which returned overlapping radiocarbon dates for the Austin Phase of the
Late Prehistoric Interval (see Chapters 7 and 8). Eighteen pieces of fragmented
bone totaling 2.3 grams were collected in Level 4. These pieces all pertained to
large mammals, though only one fragment was identifiable as a vertebrate
fragment. Based on this vertebrate fragment, the bone is believed to be that of a
deer, though the poor preservation of the material makes firm assignation
difficult. The remaining 15 fragments totaling 2.7 grams of material from Level
5 were also from a large mammal, but owing to the poor preservation and their
small size the material could not be assigned to a particular species. None of
the specimens exhibited evidence of burning, an interesting observation in light
of the hearth context in which the material was recovered. Given the recovery of
macrobotanical remains of fuel and consumable plant material (see below) and
comparison with other similar features for which the primary purpose is believed
to be the cooking of floral material, it seems likely that the bone may be
secondary refuse that was deposited in the feature, rather than material
prepared in it.

In the case of 41UV68, a poor preservational environment rather than a lack of
resource utilization by the site inhabitants likely accounts for the low faunal
recovery. In addition to being fragmented, the specimens recovered at 41UV68
were all severely root etched and the surfaces deteriorated, all evidence of
significant post depositional effects on the specimens. Comparison with other
sites in the region with Transitional Archaic/Late Prehistoric occupations
provides insight into the 41UV68 material. For example, faunal recovery from
the primarily Austin Phase occupation at the Heard Schoolhouse Site (41UV86)
was similarly limited and very fragmented (Creel and Goode 1997:229).
However, bone from this site did exhibit burning and most was located away
from the burned rock midden where it is suggested the primary processing took
place (Decker 1997:620). The analysis identified large mammal, including deer,
but also had a broader variety of medium and small vertebrates (Decker
1997:620).
Excavations at the Mingo Site (41BN101), a Transitional
Archaic/Late Prehistoric campsite, also recovered a very limited amount of bone
(Houk and Lohse 1993:217). Hester’s (1971) excavations at the La Jita Site
(41UV21) produced a more robust faunal assemblage, but the faunal analyst
notes the poor preservational context of the site and the highly fragmented
condition of the material (Riskind 1971:140). This assemblage was interpreted
as being focused on deer (Riskind 1971:142), but this site presents some
difficulty for comparison due to the mixing of Archaic and Late Prehistoric
components. Though not identified within the 41UV68 faunal assemblage, the
fragmented nature of the 41UV21 and 41UV86 collections were both in part the
result of the intentional smashing of the bone (Decker 1997:620; Riskind
1971:143).
In summary, 41UV68 is typical of similar sites in the region in terms of the
faunal assemblage. The emphasis, though provisional for lack of a significant
sample, appears focused on large mammal, likely deer given their ubiquity in the
local environment. The condition of the faunal sample is also typical of these
other sites in being very fragmented – perhaps as the result of intentional
smashing of the bone by the site inhabitants – and poorly preserved due to a
depositional environment that is not conducive to the preservation of bone.

10.2 FLORAL
Of the 32 flotation samples that were chosen for analysis, the majority returned
materials that were clearly modern in age and not aspects of the prehistoric
occupation of the site. As described in Appendix E, the determination of
modern versus prehistoric macrobotanical remains was predicated on the low
likelihood that these materials would survive in an open site in relatively wet
environment. As a result only carbonized materials were considered as likely
remains of prehistoric activity. Though the presence of modern materials does
underscore the ongoing disturbance of the site due to various natural processes,

Archeological Mitigation – UV68 – July 2007

138

Organic Recovery

their significance for an understanding of the site and the activities conducted
here by its prehistoric inhabitants are not significant and the material will not
be dealt with further in this chapter (see Appendix E for a full discussion of
modern plant remains).
The plant remains recovered from flotation samples in Features 5, 7/22, 8/9,
and 21 indicate that the most likely prehistoric materials to be present were
charred pieces of wood, presumably remnants of the primary combustion
material. Including material collected from flotation samples (n=460) and from
charcoal samples (n=83), a total of 543 pieces of charred wood were collected
weighing 31.4 grams. Feature 21, a hearth feature in the A Horizon occupation
zone in Unit 8 contained mesquite and an unknown wood. Both Feature 7/22 in
Unit 11 and Feature 8/9 in Unit 12 were associated with mesquite and oak
wood. These results are further supported by the identification of charcoal
samples collected from the same contexts which were primarily mesquite, as
well as a woody legume root in Feature 8/9. Similar root material was also
recovered in association with a dense occupational scatter originally defined as
Feature 5 in Unit 9. This apparent preference for mesquite is interesting in light
of the results of the macrobotanical materials from the Heard Schoolhouse Site
(41UV86) where oak is the most common firewood (Dering 1997:583). This
difference may be a result of environmental differences between the two sites –
41UV86 is located in hillier upland context and 41UV68 adjacent to Cooks
Slough – which was affecting the selection of fuel wood by the site inhabitants.
The most important samples were those collected within or adjacent to Feature
8/9 in Unit 12, an Austin phase Late Prehistoric oven (Table 26). Here nine
charred hackberry seeds and four bulb fragments – likely wild onion – were
found within the confines of the feature in Level 4. Unlike the wood and root
recovery, this material is believed to be evidence of some of the types of foods
that were being prepared and eaten at the site. Furthermore, the context of the
recovery, within an oven feature, suggests that these foods were specifically
being processed in this feature. Additionally, one charred prickly pear seed, two
hackberry seeds and four more bulb fragments were recovered from the column
samples taken from Level 2, 4 and 5 in Unit 12. Though the association with the
oven feature is less clear, the recovery of a similar set of plant materials adjacent
to the feature strongly argue for their association. Feature 8/9, the best
preserved of all the features excavated at the site, has been firmly dated the
Austin Phase of the Late Prehistoric Interval and the macrobotanical material
from it can be assumed to similarly date to this occupation.

The recovered plant remains from Feature 8/9 are a significant contribution to
our understanding of the use of burned rock cooking ovens because onion bulbs
had not been previously recovered from other local contexts for this time period.
Archeological Mitigation – UV68 – July 2007

Organic Recovery

At the Heard Schoolhouse Site and the Woodrow Heard site – sites from which
we have the most comparable data – one of the primary plants being processed
was sotol/yucca (Decker et al 2000:169; Dering 1997:588). At 41UV68 there is
no evidence for sotol/yucca, but the processing of bulbs fragments, probably
from wild onion. While bulb fragments were recovered from the Woodrow Heard
Site from Archaic contexts (Decker et al 2000:169), none were recovered from
the Heard Schoolhouse site, a site whose age is consistent with a Late
Prehistoric period occupation likely comparable to that associated with the
utilization of the Feature 8/9 oven. This may suggest that there is a difference in
the resource focus at each site that may have a seasonal correlate. This
suggestion finds further support in the difference noted by Dering in the types of
wood utilized as charcoal between the sites. Whereas the primary material is oak
at 41UV86, the predominance of mesquite would seem to suggest that the local
resources bases are different, as would be expected of sites that are situated in
different environmental zones.
The negative evidence for the presence of prehistoric vegetal food remains
associated with the other site features has interesting implications. By contrast
to the types of remains recovered from Feature 8/9, the lack of edible material
suggests possible functional differences between the site’s burned rock features.
The presence of burned rocks and carbonized wood remains in association with
Features 21 and 7/22 strongly suggests that these are hearth features – or their
remnants - in the sense that they were a locus of the intentional heating of
rocks. While this may be a factor of poor preservation, it seems likely that these
features served functions other than the baking of floral material. Thus it can
be said in summary that the plant remains from 41UV68 support the
observation that the burned rock features were likely hearths based on the
recovery of carbonized fuel wood. Furthermore, within the site, burned rock
features appear to represent multiple types of activities. The clear use of a
burned rock oven for the cooking of onion bulbs and possibly hackberry seeds
by the Austin Phase inhabitants of the site, may mark a change in site function
over time, or may be an indication of different use areas within the larger site
context.

10.3 SUMMARY
The faunal and plant remains from the 41UV68 data recovery excavation provide
important information for our understanding of life at the site. First, it provides
important data on the types of foods that were being consumed by the site
inhabitants. While the faunal material is extremely limited, it provides additional
data to a regional site database that is consistently underrepresented due to
apparently non-conducive conditions for the preservation of the material. It
indicates that large vertebrate, probably deer, were a focus of the site
inhabitants’ hunting, a practice consistent with that of other regional site
occupations. The data on utilization of plant resources is also limited but
significant. Edible plants recovered from site contexts included prickly pear,
hackberry seeds, and wild onion bulbs. The recovery of onion bulb fragments
within and surrounding an Austin Phase baking pit is a significant contribution
to our understanding of the local resource base because it provides heretofore
unknown data on the types of plants being processed and how. Combined with
the reliance on primarily mesquite rather than oak shown by the charcoal
recovered from multiple site contexts, the macrobotanical assemblage at
41UV68 strongly suggests that this site and the local environment were utilized
differently from other sites in the region with similar temporal components.

Finally, the presence of charcoal in different types of burned rock features
suggests that the inhabitants utilized hot rock appliances for multiple activities.

SYNTHESIS AND CONCLUSIONS

11.1 SITE DATING AND FORMATION PROCESSES
The Cooks Slough Site (41UV68) represents several thousand years of sequential
prehistoric occupations. These occupations are buried in approximately 60
centimeters of Holocene overbank alluvium and colluvial sediments in more or
less a stratigraphically coherent fashion. A significant volume of the buried site
deposits especially the most recent site occupations are actively eroding out at
the surface over much of the site. Site chronology is determined on the basis of
test unit excavation data, radiocarbon ages, feature evaluations and associated
diagnostic artifacts. A series of sequential site occupations is present spanning
from approximately 3000-800 B.P. The oldest occupations at the site can with
confidence be attributed to approximately 3000 B.P. and therefore the Late
Archaic I interval of west central Texas prehistory (Collins 2004). A few
diagnostic artifacts and radiocarbon ages of questionable context could extend
the site prehistory as far back as the Middle Archaic Nolan age interval. A few
Nolan projectiles are found buried and on the surface of the site. One
radiocarbon age from an eroding surficial feature may place the occupations as
early as approximately 3400 B.P. (testing phase). While there are suggestions of
older occupation, the stratigraphic position of an intact hearth remnant and an
associated radiocarbon age (Test Unit 8, Feature 4) confidently places site
occupation as early the Late Archaic Interval (ca. 3000 B.P.) and perhaps older.
Data from the testing phase indicated a series of Transitional Archaic to Late
Prehistoric occupations. The answer to the data recovery question of “does the
site contain older occupations” is answered “yes”. There is significant evidence
of a series of Late Archaic I/II, Transitional Archaic and Late Prehistoric
occupations at the site.
The dating sequence from Test Unit 8 is representative of the larger site context.
A series of two humate and one AMS charcoal date were analyzed from the
dense cultural deposits of Test Unit 8. The upper A horizon (Ab1) at the site is
represented by two radiocarbon ages in Test Unit 8, one a sediment humate age
from Feature 21, a dense rock cluster located at the base of the A-Horizon, of
2140-1930 B.P. (Humate Sample 85, Beta 212461, 2-sigma, Table 27). This age
is Late Archaic I (Collins 2004). This sediment age may be erroneously young
due to the infiltration of organic carbon into the lower site deposits. A
Transitional Archaic – Late Prehistoric sediment age was obtained slightly higher
in the A Horizon from under a particularly large feature-like rock of 1170-970
B.P. (Humate Sample 80, Beta 212460, 2-sigma). In Test Unit 8, the A-Horizon
sediments are characterized by a zone of Late Archaic I/II and Transitional
Archaic occupations, in basic stratigraphic order, and relatively superimposed
over one another. A distinct lower feature remnant (Feature 4) was documented
at the base of the B Horizon overlying Leona formation Pleistocene age silts. A
piece of wood charcoal located adjacent to the feature yielded and AMS assay of
3340-3070 B.P. (C-14 Sample 52, Beta 212458, 2-sigma). This radiocarbon age
is Late Archaic I or Pedernales age in nature in terms of the central Texas
chronology. There is also the possibility that this piece of charcoal infiltrated
from the upper deposits, though seemingly in-situ, and the two Nolan-like
diagnostic projectiles recovered from this elevation range may more accurately
reflect the age of the initial site occupations (ca. 4500-4000 B.P). Test Unit 8
exhibits a continuous zone of prehistoric occupation characterized by two
principal strata (A/B), by two spatially and vertically overlapping features in the
lower A and shallow B horizons, and is associated with a relatively coherent

series of sediment and AMS radiocarbon dates suggesting a continuous
sequence of occupation from at least 3000-1000 B.P.
As described below, the A Horizon appears to contain a series of overprinted but
well preserved series of Late Archaic I transitioning into Late Archaic II,
Transitional Archaic and Late Prehistoric occupations in the upper 40
centimeters of overbank alluvial and colluvial deposits. Though overprinted,
there is a basic stratigraphic coherence to the sequence of occupations, and
some well preserved individual features that appear to date to specific time
frames. Site occupation was at least seasonal from at least 3000 B.P.. Artifacts
are present throughout the Holocene age sediment profile (A/B). Occupational
intensity may have been less in the early history of the site, or the remains are
not well preserved, based on the slightly lower density of cultural materials and
the lesser degree of organic modification observed in the lower B horizon. The
Late Archaic II Interval, at roughly 1600-1300 B.P. reflects a higher density
occupation and initial anthropic modification of the site sediments. The series
of repeated site occupations through approximately 1200 years (2000-800 B.P.)
resulted in the development of an extensively modified, organic laden anthropic
soil (A–Horizon) in the upper site deposits. Late Archaic II and Transitional
Archaic occupations are represented by a series of superimposed occupational
remnants with later pit features excavated into earlier surface and feature
remnants (20-40 cm). Late Prehistoric age subsistence features are typically
located higher in the sediment profile yet still were excavated into lower Archaic
deposits (20 cm). Late Archaic and Transitional Archaic features are located
deeper in the sediments, at the base of the modified A-Horizon, and the Late
Prehistoric occupations are located closer to the surface. Occupation was much
more intensive and better preserved in the later site history (Late II, Transitional
and Late Prehistoric Intervals), based on the site data.
The site is characterized in part by a dense zone of burned rocks and lithics and
by a series of well preserved hearth remnants clustered at the bottom of the AHorizon at the contact with the upper B zone (Bwb1). Two features studied
during the data recovery illustrate the Late Archaic I/II and Transitional Archaic
nature of subsistence related hearth feature remnants shallowly buried in the
sediments at approximately 20-40 centimeters at the bottom of the A horizon
sediments. Feature 20 was a distinct, discreet, single lens cluster of variously
sized burned rocks (60 x 60 cm) located at the interface between the A and B
Horizons (Unit 9). Feature 20 was recorded within a dense accumulation or

zone of prehistoric cultural debris between 20-40 centimeters below the surface.
Significantly, two radiocarbon dates, one a sediment humate date from under
the Feature 20 rocks, and the other an AMS date on charred wood adjacent to
the rock cluster both indicate Late Archaic I/II time frame. A range of 1410­
1720 B.P. is indicated for Feature 20 and the associated zone of materials
(1570-1410 B.P., 2-sigma, Beta 212455; 1720-1540 B.P., 2-sigma, Beta 212453,
Table 27). The fact that these dates nearly overlap is compelling evidence of the
intact feature context, and also of the integrity of the sediment humate dates.
Feature 7/22 was a distinct basined, rock-filled pit with an associated sediment
stain (Test Unit 11). Level 3 marked the highest density of burned rocks and
debitage in Unit 11 overlying the transition to the B Horizon sediments at 40
centimeters below the surface. The top of the Feature 7/22 sediment stain and
the pit initiated at 32 centimeters in Level 3 and extended through the B
sediments to a depth of 55 centimeters. An elongated dense concentration of
burned rocks formed the southwest perimeter of the soil stain from 43-55
centimeters (B Horizon). Feature 7/22 is interpreted to be a small pit oven
whose origination point coincided with the highest density zone of cultural
materials in Level 3. One AMS radiocarbon date on charred wood from the
upper portions of the pit in Level 3 yielded a Transitional Archaic age of 1290­
1160 B.P. (2-sigma, Beta 212459, Table 27). Three diagnostic artifacts all
recovered from the test unit at the base of the A-Horizon and within the dense
occupation zone generally match this radiocarbon age (Ensor, Darl, Edwards
projectiles, 30-38 cm). Ensor points can be considered to extend to 1500-1300
B.P. and Edwards arrow points as late as 1100 B.P. (Collins 2004). All three
points are consistent with a Late Archaic II occupation overprinted by
Transitional and Late Prehistoric components from approximately 1300-1000
B.P.
Feature 8/9 (Test Unit 12) was an impressive, large earth oven remnant with an
intact basal rock bed element, an associated charcoal stained area and
significant zone of upper lid or rake out rocks representing the top of the
feature. The upper rocks of Feature 8/9 were first recorded at 26 centimeters
below the surface, with the basal elements penetrating into the Leona Formation
silts. Thus, this large, well preserved pit feature had a higher origination point
than most of the sites rock hearths or pits, in the upper A-Horizon, just below
the disturbed slopewash zone (AC), and not at the contact between the A/B
Horizons. Radiocarbon dates are consistent with feature use in the later site
history during the Late Prehistoric Interval. Fully four AMS radiocarbon ages
were obtained from Feature 8/9 indicating a Late Prehistoric Austin Interval
time frame. Four overlapping AMS ages with Del C-13 values suggestive of wood
charcoal indicate feature use between 940-690 B.P. (2-sigma, Table 27). Three
of the ages overlap from 940-760 B.P. and represent a relatively narrow Late
Prehistoric Interval of use. Even more important, charred hackberry seeds,
onion bulbs, oak and mesquite wood were recovered in the 13 sediment samples
collected for flotation. Feature 8/9 represents significant evidence of Austin
Interval earth oven processing of onion bulbs and hackberry seeds during the
Edwards transitioning into the Scallorn projectile intervals. Two Ensor darts
recorded within feature contents are interpreted to represent a Late Prehistoric
pit excavated into underlying Late Archaic II occupations and churning up older
diagnostics. The series of four AMS radiocarbon dates seems well ordered and is
consistent with the presence of Edwards projectiles in other site contexts.

Synthesis and Conclusions

11.2 CULTURAL ZONES AND DATA POTENTIAL
Based on the limited data recovery sample, the site represents a series of
shallowly overprinted Late and Transitional Archaic and Late Prehistoric
occupations in approximately 40-60 centimeters of overbank alluvial and
slopewash generated sediments at the site. There is noticeable but limited
stratification in the deposits. The Late Archaic (or older) occupations in Test
Unit 8 appear semi-stratified, but part of a larger, dense zone of material that
represents a two-thousand-year period. A series of well preserved rock hearth
and pit features predominantly representing the Late II and Transitional Archaic
time intervals are present at approximately 20-40 centimeters below the surface,
dating to approximately 1700-1100 B.P. or a span of some 600 years. These
occupations mark the first significant earth oven processing at the site, probably
by larger groups reflecting more intensive site utilization during the Late II
through Transitional Archaic Intervals, resulting in significantly modified
anthropogenic site sediments. A Late Prehistoric Austin Interval series of
features is also overprinted onto the Late II and Transitional Archaic
occupations at the site (20-40 cm).
The greatest data potential at the site may be represented by the Late Prehistoric
Austin Interval deposits. These represent a series of extremely well preserved pit
features in the upper site sediments. Feature 8/9 and several others represent
intact features and therefore site structure with abundant organic remains.
Charred wood, onion bulbs and hackberry seeds, and faunal remains are
present in the Late Prehistoric features sampled. Edwards projectile points
recovered in various site contexts appear to match the radiocarbon chronology
for these features. Well preserved site structural components and organics
dating to the Austin Interval are relatively rare in the west central Texas
archeological record. Feature 8/9 offers direct evidence of the earth oven
preparation of lily onion bulbs, faunal materials, and perhaps hackberry fruit as
part of the seasonal camping strategy. Feature 8/9 is a rare, well preserved
evidence of earth oven cooking and onion bulb processing during the Edwards
or perhaps Scallorn Phase of the Austin Interval (though no evidence of a
Scallorn occupation was documented). Intact archeological remains have the
potential to promote interpretation of site structure and organization, feature
morphology and use, settlement patterning, mobility and subsistence strategies,
by studying the features and associated faunal, macrobotanical, lithic and
organic materials for a poorly documented period of prehistory. Edwards
Interval features are present closer to the edge of Cooks Slough adjacent to
channel gravel flood deposits. Whereas Transitional and Late Archaic remains
are less well preserved and somewhat culturally overprinted at the site, there are
large areas of intact Late Prehistoric occupations located adjacent to the river
that remain unexplored.

11.3 EARTH OVEN COOKERY
North American ethnographic literature illustrates that a variety of food
resources including agave family and lily family bulbs, sotol, many root plants,
breads, meats, clams and cacti can be baked, steamed, or otherwise prepared in
cooking facilities broadly termed as rock/earth ovens (Black et al. 1997:297).
The ovens documented as the basic building blocks of central Texas burned rock
middens were layered arrangements of heated limestone rocks, earth and
vegetation that formed spherical and hemispherical cooking enclosures primarily
for baking and steaming (Black et al. 1997:297).
The baking aspect is

Archeological Mitigation – UV68 – July 2007

147

Synthesis and Conclusions

particularly important in the preparation of sotol and cactus, which require
extended periods of oven processing before rendering the plants edible to
humans, and a rich source of carbohydrates. Steaming is very important for the
processing of Lily family bulbs. Ovens offered these advantages over open
hearths.
Earth ovens, as part of burned rock midden complexes, and
peripheral hearths at archeological sites were used to process a diversity of
resources including a wide variety of seeds, nuts, fruits, and a multitude of
animals and reptiles, of all size ranges. Bone finds indicate the splintering of
animal bones may have been important for marrow extraction and bone grease.
Based on the Honey Creek findings and at other sites, Black et al. (1997)
convincingly equate burned rock midden formation with the repeated use and
reuse of earth ovens in various arrangements, and observe that ovens could
function to process many resources especially plant foods. The evidence is
beginning to suggest that burned rock midden sites located on the eastern side
of the Edwards Plateau are quite likely to have been processing locales for the
bulk production of geophytes, primarily bulbs (Dering 2007). Central Texas
middens were also typically centers for variable amounts of lithic reduction
activities.
The primary archeological signature of an earth oven facility is the hot rock bed
(Black et al. 1997:259). The hot rock bed is the lower heating element of an
oven and its primary defining feature. Obvious hot rock beds exhibit an oval
outline shape and are composed of one or more layers of fire-fractured and/or
carbon stained limestone rocks, usually large relatively unspent, unfractured
rocks. Intact hot rock beds probably represent the latest in a series of oven
reuse events focused within a central pit or central depression within a burned
rock midden, due to the intact state of preservation. Oven hot rock beds are
also commonly found in individual or a-midden contexts. Associated oven
elements often consist of rockless or rock filled pits contained in highly organic
sediments and also nearby jumbled piles, clusters or scatters of burned rocks.
Rockless or rock filled pits represent previous oven events that have been
cleaned of their contents either for food consumption, and/or reuse in a
different oven arrangement. Adjacent rock piles, rock clusters or scatters are
interpreted as either oven lids or clean out debris. Adjacent scatters of
comparably sized rocks are likely oven lid rocks or the upper heating elements of
an earth oven, though earth ovens can be of various construction techniques.
In contrast, piles or scatters containing mostly small, highly angular, highly
fractured rocks are interpreted to represent clean-out or rake-out debris from
either rock beds or upper heating elements (assuming large rocks picked up and
reused).
A well-preserved oven should be marked archeologically by
concentrations of charcoal, ash, oxidized earth, and other indications of intense
burning (Black et al. 1997:260).
At or about the 1990’s, sediment flotation techniques became prevalent as an
analytical tool in burned rock midden studies (Dering 2007). With the advent of
flotation techniques, multiple sites have yielded evidence of charred food and
fuel remains from burned rock midden contexts including from within central
oven facilities. Among the documented or suspected processed food items in
middens are sotol/luchugilla/agave, yucca, prickly pear (fruits and pads),
acorns, and a variety of geophytes, primarily lily family bulbs (camas, wild
onions). Charred sotol and luchugilla stems and roots are documented at
numerous central burned rock midden Texas sites as early as 8-9000 B.P. Lily
family bulbs are being identified in ever-increasing numbers of burned rock
midden sites in central Texas sites including the Honey Creek Site in west
central Texas (Black et al. 1997), the Jonas Terrace Site in south central Texas
Archeological Mitigation – UV68 – July 2007

148

Synthesis and Conclusions

(Dering 1995), the Wilson-Leonard Site in east central Texas (Dering 2007) and
Horn Shelter in north central Texas (Dering 2007). Overall, Dering (2007) has
identified geophytes (bulbs and other forms) from 37 sites in 14 Texas counties,
including some from far west Texas. While the predominance of these finds are
Transitional to Late Prehistoric in age, bulbs, especially Camas, are identified in
Late Archaic contexts, and as early as ca. 8000 B.P. at the Wilson-Leonard site.
These findings provide a record of geophyte exploitation in burned rock midden
oven contexts that spans the Holocene in Texas.
Most relevant to the current study is the preponderance of central Texas
evidence from the Late Prehistoric Interval. Dering (2007) documents over 300
intact bulbs recovered and identified as onion, camas, and dog-tooth violet
(Dering 2003) at numerous sites at Camp Bowie in Brown County, Texas. In
fact, a number of Camp Bowie sites exhibit Lily onion, generic onion (Alliums
pp.), or Eastern Camas bulbs with radiocarbon ages that overlap the findings at
the Cooks Slough site (41UV68, 760-940 B.P.). Additional Austin and Toyah
Interval central Texas sites that exhibit earth ovens and charred onion bulbs
include the Mustang Branch site (41HY209), Kyle Rockshelter (41HI1) and the
Toyah Bluff site (41TV441, Dering 2007).
Evidence for earth ovens and associated charred onion bulbs or other plant
foods is less dramatic in west central Texas. Two sites have yielded significant
evidence of earth oven cooking. These sites include the Woodrow Heard Site
(41UV88), and the Heard Schoolhouse Site (41UV86), both located on the
southern scarp of the Edwards Plateau (Appendix E). The Heard Schoolhouse
site yielded sotol/yucca fiber-vascular bundles, walnut, acorn fragments, pecan
fragments, prickly pear, and grass seed (Dering 1997). Findings at the Woodrow
Heard site (41UV88) included sotol/yucca, pecan, acorn fragments, grass seed,
and a bulb fragment (lily family, cf. onion; Decker et al. 2000:169). The bulb
fragment was documented in a somewhat mixed context ambiguously dated to
the Late Archaic - Late Prehistoric periods (3500-300 B.P). The inhabitants of
both 41UV86 and 41UV88 were focusing on many different resources available
in streamside and canyon environments available along the Plateau's southern
rim, including woodland mast products from the canyons and resources
associated with open or hillside habitats such as sotol/yucca (Dering 2007).
Per Dering (Appendix E), with the identification of onion bulbs from 41UV68,
geophytes now have been recovered from two sites in Uvalde County. In this
area earth ovens were likely used for geophytes as well as cooking sotol or
lechuguilla and other foods. Prickly pear seeds were found at 41UV68 and were
also identified at the Heard Schoolhouse site (Appendix E). The Cooks Slough
Site (41UV68) adds to the growing body of literature at least for adjacent central
Texas of the Austin Interval use of earth ovens and associated onion bulbs,
prickly pear and hackberry fruit (charred seeds). Sotol, yucca and lechugilla
roots and fruit were likely utilized as well, as sotol is abundant in the area
today. The well preserved findings at the Cooks Slough Site (41UV68) are
consistent with the Late Prehistoric findings in the central Texas archeological
record and with the growing knowledge base indicating geophyte processing in
earth ovens for many, many thousands of years across Texas. What is unique
is that 41UV68 represents one of only a few sites with such documented organic
remains in west central Texas, in the area of Uvalde.
Though earth ovens and hearths represent the most archeologically visible
activity areas at the site, the remaining artifact assemblage provides important
clues for understanding the type of site represented by the archeological
Archeological Mitigation – UV68 – July 2007

149

Synthesis and Conclusions

deposits and the range of activities that may have occurred here. From the
diverse collection of stone tools and debitage, as well as the faunal and
macrobotanical materials recovered during the excavations, the site appears to
have functioned as a generalized camp site within the context of the prehistoric
settlement strategy.
Formal tool types recovered included projectile points, bifaces, unifaces, and
ground stone, suggesting a multitude of different activities were being carried
out. Of these tasks, hunting and the processing of game were likely important,
though the recovery of a bone was limited, making assessment of what types of
animals were the focus of hunting strategies impossible to define. In this respect
the projectile points would have likely served as the hunting tools, and the finely
worked bifaces and possibly unifaces and edge modified flakes likely serving as
butchering tools. The large number of unifacial tools, while not displaying the
sort of functional specialization attributed to more formal types from Toyah
assemblages linked to specialized big game hunting, nonetheless point towards
a possible working of hides at the site. It is possible that the groundstone mano
may also have served in this manner.
Given the presence of the earth oven and the recovery of several kinds of edible
seeds, the groundstone may have also served as a mano for the processing of
these. The importance of the utilization of local plants as food stuffs likely
underscores the role of forager type strategies employed in tandem with hunting
by the site occupants. The presence of numerous informal flake tools –
particularly those concentrated around the earth oven, also indicates the
processing of materials associated with these features. The seven Stage 2 bifaces
and fragments exhibiting use wear may also indicate the importance of working
wood at the site, either for making wooden tools or processing it into usable
firewood. The evidence for the exploitation of mesquite as a primary fuel source
and the possible root mining clearly demonstrate the use of wood. Indeed it is
not inconceivable that the Stage 2 biface may have served not only as adze like
instruments, but may also have been utilized as digging tools.
In addition to subsistence related activities, the debitage and Stage 1 and 2
bifaces and fragments indicate that bifacial tool production was another
important activity carried out on site. The debitage appears to indicate that
much of the initial reduction was conducted off site or elsewhere within the site
as the majority of debitage appears to be from later stages of tool manufacture.
Unlike the Heard Schoolhouse (41UV86; Creel and Goode 1997) and Mingo Sites
(41BN101; Houk and Lohse 1993), the lithic technology at the 41UV68 is
weighted towards bifacial tool production, though core reduction for the
manufacture of flake tools was present throughout the assemblage and may
have become more important over time. Also the evidence for the production of
projectile points is limited, again different than the patterns observed for the
Heard Schoolhouse, Mingo and La Jita Sites.
In summary, the artifact assemblage, earth oven and hearth features all point
toward the use of the Cooks Slough Site as a generalized base camp throughout
the period of occupation from the Late Archaic through Austin Interval of the
Late Prehistoric. The broad range of activities and tool types present compare
favorably with the La Jita Site (41UV21; Hester 1971), and show interesting
differences with 41UV86 and the Mingo Site. When viewed in comparison with
other sites in the region, 41UV68 has the potential through future study to
contribute to an understanding of hunter gather settlement strategies and the
relationship between environment, resource availability and prehistoric activity.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On behalf of AEP and the LCRA, regulatory clearance for the transmission line to
proceed was achieved under the Texas Antiquities Code (TAC) in an interim
letter (dated 7/22/05). The limited mitigation conducted satisfied the terms and
conditions of field research for TAC Permit 3833. The site deposits represent
several thousand years of west central Texas prehistory, much of which is
actively eroding on the surface. The site deposits are currently heavily subject
to erosion from wind and water, in the form of sheetwash runoff. Thousands of
artifacts are eroding on the surface.
This report documents the limited
mitigation of the site transmission line access road and of three proposed
transmission line pole replacements (through both testing and data recovery).
The mitigation sampled significant archeological deposits that have the potential
to further contribute to the understanding of the west central Texas
archeological record. Significant areas of site deposits likely remain at the site
outside of sampled areas. All site areas outside of the access road and the three
pole locations, but within the mapped site boundaries are recommended for
additional archeological subsurface excavations and documentation should
there be any further ground disturbing transmission line activities. This
approach is especially recommended for areas east of the access road and Pole
1/5, between the pole location and Cooks Slough. This is an area of deeper,
intact site sediments likely to contain well preserved prehistoric pit features,
especially Late Prehistoric components. Given the established importance of
intact site context, structure and organic remains (onion bulbs) in Austin
Interval age occupations (see above), the areas immediately adjacent to the west
side of the slough should be subject to intensive archeological investigations
relative to any future planned impacts. This area retains the potential for well
preserved prehistoric remains dating from 3000-800 B.P. Although a private
company managing a private facility and one not generally subject to cultural
resource preservation statutes, American Electric Power (AEP) has established
their proactive stance for the environment and historic preservation, and should
consider additional site documentation relative to any future expansion plans.
This is due to the extremely sensitive nature and potential importance of the
remaining site deposits. This report is offered in partial fulfillment of TAC
Permit 3833. All artifacts and project related materials will be curated at the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) of the University of Texas at
Austin.

APPENDIX A – ARTIFACT CATALOG
Appendix A is a catalog of all lithic artifacts collected and analyzed during the
mitigation phase of investigations at 41UV68. The appendix is organized into
two sections.
The first section provides a summary of the laboratory
methodology employed in the processing and sorting of the different classes of
lithic artifacts collected at the site. The second section presents a series of
tables containing individual artifact data. Contextual analysis of the artifacts is
presented primarily in Chapter 9: Lithic Tools and Debris and in the other
contextual chapters.

A.1

LABORATORY METHODOLOGY
All stone tools collected during the mitigation phase of investigations at 41UV68
were brought to the Hicks & Company lab for cataloguing and analysis. Once in
the lab, bags of artifacts were washed and their contents sorted into the
following categories: bifaces and biface fragments, projectile points, unifaces,
cores, ground or battered stone, debitage, fire cracked/burned rock, and gravels.
At this stage all artifacts were counted, weighed, assigned permanent lot
numbers, and recorded on a specimen inventory. All individual tools were then
assigned Unique item numbers by appending sequential secondary numbers to
the end of the lot number (ex. 198-1). For each lot number, unique item
numbers were assigned in a consecutive order starting with 1. Artifacts were
then labeled using a Zig millennium archival ink pen and coated in Acryloid B­
72. Artifacts were then stored in 4mil acid free curation bags with individual
labels written on acid free paper. Burned rocks, gravels, and fire cracked rock
were counted, weighed, and recorded but will not be permanently curated.
Following the initial sorting and cataloging of the collection, the formal tools and
debitage were subjected to a second more intensive level of analysis, the
particulars of which are detailed below. All formal tool analysis utilized
standardized recording forms. All information was then entered into a Microsoft
Access Database.

A.1.1

Bifacial Tools (Projectile Points/Bifaces)
Broadly speaking, the term biface is applied to any chipped stone tool that
exhibits intentional shaping through the removal of flakes from both faces of the
artifact along a parallel and opposing axis (Kelly 1988:718; Whittaker 1994:178;
Crabtree 1972). Presumably, bifaces were manufactured with the intention of
creating a sharp and uniform cutting edge and these artifacts are believed to
have served primarily as a slicing and butchering tool. Within the biface
collection, a difference is recognized between those examples that exhibit clear
evidence of being manufactured for hafting on the end of a shaft and those for
which such evidence is lacking.
Following standard usage within Texas
archeology these hafted artifacts are termed projectile points and assumed to
have functioned as the penetrating tip of projectile that is launched through an
armature such as an atlatl or from a bow. Ahler’s (1971) widely cited observation
of multifunctional role of artifacts called projectile points is duly noted, but the
small number of the specimens identified as projectile points in this study
compared to the other bifacial tools merits their separation from the rest of the
collection for both descriptive and interpretive purposes.
It is however
recognized that these artifacts may have served as knives or even scraper type
tools either while still bound to a shaft or not, and indeed several of the

specimens discussed appear to have been utilized for roles beyond that of
projectile points.
The Life History Approach
Both the bifaces and projectile points are examined within the analytical frame
of the “life history approach” (Karbula 2000). This analysis draws on the
assumption that bifacial technology is a linear process that can be broken down
into stages for the purposes of analysis in order to assess the relationship
between sites and the types of activities conducted at them (Collins 1975:16;
Patterson 1977:60). As conceived here, there are four basic stages essentially
comparable to those employed in Johnson (1995) and Black et al. (1997a:456­
457), with refinements following Karbula (2000). While the stages utilized in
this analysis are not absolute – there are often specimens that do not easily fit
within one stage or another or in multiple – the analysis assigned stages based
on the overall character of the artifact, accepting that there is a certain degree of
subjectivity on the part of the analysts in assigning the stage. The stages as
defined for this study are:
Stage 1 consists of the initial thinning and primary reduction of the biface
usually through direct percussion with an object such as a hammerstone. Stage
1 bifaces exhibit very sinuous edges, large irregular flake scars and lumpy
asymmetrical appearances (Potter and Black 1995:40). Stage 1 bifaces are
generally very thick, and are much larger and heavier, and retain a greater
degree of cortex than later stage bifaces (Karbula 1998:298).
Stage 2 bifaces represent secondary thinning, usually to create preforms for
knives or projectile points.
These are generally symmetrical bifaces with
moderately sinuous edges and only small areas of cortex (Potter and Black
1995:40). Stage 2 bifaces are well along the process of thinning and shaping
and often exhibit secondary retouch along the lateral edges. Such retouch is
often accomplished with a small pressure flaking tool and is applied to remove
the thinning flake ridges in order to create a thinner, sharper edge (Black et al.
1998:298).
Stage 3 represents advanced thinning and shaping as the biface approaches its
final form. The artifact is very thin and symmetrical in shape and the lateral
edges are very straight and even. There is often extensive secondary retouch in
the form of pressure flaking along the lateral edges. For purposes of this
analysis, which is slightly deviated from previous studies (Black et al. 1997b),
Stage 3 bifaces are in the final thinning and sharpening stages, or are finished
but do not exhibit signs of use. As such, these are relatively rare finds in central
Texas archeological sites, and when recovered represent an artifact broken
during the final stages of completion.
Stage 4 bifaces are finished tools that clearly exhibit signs of use. Signs of
utilization include either visible use wear or use-related modification such as
edge resharpening (Karbula 1998:298). Stage 4 bifaces are characterized by
heavily resharpened lateral edges and/or asymmetrical blades (Potter and Black
1995:40). There are often significant alterations in lateral edge angles due to
resharpening. A combination of altered edge angles with impact or other types
of use fractures is particularly indicative of Stage 4 bifaces. Stage 4 bifaces are
further subdivided into thin – 4a – and thick – 4b – specimens.

Appendix A

In addition to the staging of the artifacts, all bifacial tools had their length,
width, thickness, and weight measured and basic data relating to the overall
outline of the artifact and its cross section recorded. The analysis also focused
on identifying any possible evidence of use wear, resharpening, beveling, heating
on the specimens and describing the grain of the material and the color.
Projectile points were further analyzed for the following attributes: haft length,
base width, neck width, stem length, shoulders/barbs, basal shape (flat,
concave, convex, deep concave).
A.1.2

Unifaces
Unifaces are a class of formal tool that exhibits intentional modification and use
of the artifact edges in a unidirectional manner. In addition, formal unifacial
tools are generally recognized to have a steeply angled bit on the working edge.
At times distinguishing between unifaces and edge modified flakes within the
site assemblages proved difficult as unifacially worked and utilized artifacts
graded from those having fully shaped thick bodies and steeply beveled working
bits to those that were relatively thin. The basic attribute used to differentiate
between unifaces and edge modified flakes was the evidence for the intentional
shaping of the artifact. Unifaces are considered to have been shaped before use
to facilitate specific functional goals or hafting of the artifact. In contrast, edge
modified flakes exhibited use wear or edge retouch, but lacked evidence that the
overall shape of the artifact was intentionally reshaped prior to use.
For all analyzed unifaces the following attributes were recorded: flake type
(primary, secondary, or tertiary), location and direction of modification/use
wear, metric data (length/width/thickness), evidence of heat treatment, a
description and sketch of the artifact
Following the analysis the unifaces were categorized according to the location on
flake of the modification and use wear. Three types were identified: side
scrapers that have modification along lateral edges of the artifact, end scrapers
that modification and use wear along the distal or proximal end of the artifact,
and combination scrapers that exhibit modification to both the lateral edges and
distal/proximal ends.

A.1.3

Ground and Battered Stone
As a general artifact category groundstone was used to identify all pieces of
stone that exhibit modifications resulting from intentional abrasion and/or
pecking of the surface. These artifacts differ from other stone tool types
discussed in this appendix by virtue of not being manufactured primarily
through the process of chipped stone technology. Battered stone represents
artifacts that have surface modification consistent with being utilized as a tool
for hammering or battering another object. These artifacts vary greatly from
unmodified cobbles or stones to artifacts that have been intentionally modified,
though not necessarily for use as a battering tool. These types of tools are
commonly referred to as hammerstones because of assumption that they were
utilized basically as a hammer, either in the specific context of lithic production
or more generally as a tool for processing faunal or floral items for consumption.
In the laboratory each piece of ground and battered stone was analyzed for its
material type, metric data, the number of worked faces and the type of wear.
Additional data concerning the morphological or notable characteristics of the
artifact were also recorded on the laboratory analysis sheet.

A.1.4

Cores
Cores are broadly defined as pieces of lithic material that exhibit having been
utilized, but only exhibit evidence of negative flake scars indicating flake
removals. Cores are understood to have served primarily as parent material for
the production of other lithic tool forms and flakes. Cores often show evidence,
however, of being used as informal battering or chopping tools as well. Analysis
of these artifacts consisted of using a standardized Core Data Form to record the
metric attributes, the number, location and average length and width of flake
scars, and any other relevant morphological characteristics including color,
grain, cortex characteristics.
Analyzed cores were then classified as
unidirectional, multidirectional, bi-directional or bifacial based on the patterns
of flake removals.

A1.5

Debitage and Edge Modified Flakes
All debitage collected during the mitigation excavations was brought back to the
Hicks & Company lab where it was cleaned and weighed. Following the
termination of the fieldwork it was determined that Unit 13 was significantly
disturbed, and it was decided to not intensively analysis the lithic debitage from
this unit. The debitage from Units 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 was intensively analyzed
in the following manner.
All debitage was initially sorted used mass debitage analysis procedures outlined
in Ahler (1989).
This entailed passing the debitage through a series of
progressively smaller nested screens.
The screen sizes utilized were the
following: 1”, ¾”, ½”, ¼”, and 1/8”. Once all debitage from a level had been size
graded, flakes from each size grade were first sorted into unbroken flakes, chips,
broken flakes, edge bite flakes, core fragments, heat shatter, and edge modified
flakes. Unbroken flakes collected from each screen and then subdivided based
on the amount of dorsal cortex present in to the following categories. Primary
flakes are those with 100% cortex coverage on the dorsal side. Secondary flakes
have 99-1% dorsal cortex coverage and tertiary flakes have 0% dorsal cortex
present. Each category of flake was then
Edge bite flakes were also identified and separately counted and weighed. Edge
bite flakes are flakes “in which both surfaces of the lateral edge of the biface
were removed as the platform and are thought to be manufacturing errors”
(Masson 1998:686).
Core fragments – pieces of debris that only exhibited negative flake scars - were
also collected and recorded separately.
Broken flakes were counted, weighed, and any exhibiting evidence of thermal
alteration were counted and noted.
Chips – manufacturing debris that was complete but was angular and lacked
typical flake attributes such as platforms or bulbs – were removed from each
screen and their count recorded, their weight measured, and any that exhibited
thermal alteration noted.
Heat shatter – lithic debris that was clearly burned and exhibited no attributes
of a flake – was counted and weighed.

Appendix A

At this stage all flakes that exhibited evidence of edge modification were also
removed. Edge modified flakes were subsequently assigned to one of two
categories. Use wear flakes are artifacts that exhibit damage or modification of
the edge consistent with use of the artifact as a tool. Such modification could
include nicking, small flaking and step fracturing, or polish. Retouched flakes
were flakes that exhibited evidence of intentional and systematic modification of
the flake edge. Such modification might be a result of resharpening the artifact,
reshaping to suit a particular application, or to make the artifact more suitable
for use. Each category was counted and weighed and the number of specimens
exhibiting thermal alteration was noted.

APPENDIX E: PLANT REMAINS FROM 41UV68,
PHASE 3 EXCAVATIONS, UVALDE COUNTY, TEXAS
Phil Dering
Shumla Archeobotanical Services
The purpose of this analysis is to provide an assessment of the botanical
remains in samples recovered from excavations at 41UV68. Personnel at Hicks
and Company, Inc. processed 32 flotation samples, and submitted the light and
heavy fractions Shumla Archeobotanical Services for analysis. The flotation
effort totaled 87.65-liters and the average sample size was 2.7-liters. An
additional seven 14C/macrobotanical samples were submitted for identification.

METHODS
The analysis followed standard archeobotanical laboratory procedures for
flotation samples. Flotation is a method of recovering organic remains from
archeological sediment samples by using water to separate heavy or soluble
inorganic particles from plant parts and small animal bone. The material
floating to the surface is called the light fraction, and this is caught on a fine
mesh screen or strainer. The material that sinks to the bottom is the heavy
fraction and it is also caught on a series of screens. Most of the soil including
clay and silt is suspended in water and passes through the screens and is either
recycled or discarded. In most cases, only the light fraction is submitted for
analysis after the heavy fraction has been examined for plant materials. In the
current project, both the light and heavy fractions were submitted for analysis.
At the vast majority of open sites, only carbonized plant remains are considered
to be a potential part of the archeological record. In some rare cases certain
durable and easily identifiable wood types such as juniper may survive in a
partially carbonized state, but only at younger sites in relatively dry conditions.
Since the site is prehistoric and located in an area with over 15 inches of annual
rainfall, only carbonized plant material is considered part of the record.
The light fraction of each flotation sample is passed through a nested set of
screens of 4-mm, 2-mm, 1-mm, and 0.450-mm mesh and examined for charred
material that is separated for identification. Carbonized wood from the 4mm
and 2mm screens (smaller pieces are seldom identifiable) is separated in a 25­
piece grab sample and identified. In cases where the charred wood is abundant
(more than 25 fragments), instead of counting each fragment the volume of the
wood charcoal is recorded. The charred material caught on all the smaller sieve
levels (1 mm and 0.450 mm) and the bottom pan is scanned for floral parts,
fruits, seeds, and other potentially edible plant parts such as bulb fragments or
maize fragments. All of the potentially edible plant parts are counted and
examined for identification.
Wood charcoal is identified by snapping a fragment across the transverse and
radial planes, examining the fragments at 8 to 45 magnifications with a
binocular dissecting microscope. Wood, seeds and fruit fragments are identified

using reference specimens stored at the Shumla Archeobotanical Services
laboratory.
Counts and weights from each are presented in tabular format. These data
reflect the potential for the site to yield useful botanical data, and provide some
preliminary information on local environmental conditions in the immediate area
of the sites.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Table 1 presents details of the provenience and charcoal weight recovered from
each sample. The analysis noted a total of 460 wood fragments weighing
approximately 12.0 grams. An additional 83 fragments weighing 19.4 grams
were identified in the 14C/macrobotanical samples.
Three edible plant types were identified in the samples, hackberry seed
fragments, prickly pear seeds, and geophyte/bulb fragments, probably of wild
onion. Some of the hackberry seed fragments were charred, and both the
prickly pear seeds and the bulb fragments were charred. Three wood types were
identified in the samples, oak, mesquite, and woody legume-type. Woody
legume includes mesquite, acacia, and woody members of the legume family.
These wood types are excellent fuel sources. Oak is commonly recovered from
archeological sites along the southern Edwards Plateau, while woody legume,
especially mesquite, is more common in southern Texas, the western Edwards
Plateau, and the Trans-Pecos regions. The mix of oak and mesquite, with
mesquite clearly more abundant, probably reflects the vegetation of the area
during the occupation of the site.
Table 1 notes the abundance of disturbance indicators identified in the
samples. Disturbance indicators include roots in every sample, insect parts in
26 samples, mesquite leaflets in four samples, and fresh seeds in 19 samples.
Disturbance conditions are not unusual in southern Texas sites, but in Unit 12,
two samples from Lots 146 and 198 contained over 50 uncarbonized sunflower
seeds each. This is probably evidence of rodent activity which occurred in
Features 8/9.
The distribution of charred plant remains shows clear vertical and horizontal
patterning. Most of the charred plant material, including seeds and wood, was
noted in samples recovered from level 4. Horizontal patterning was clear as well
as demonstrated by the recovery of 10.8 grams of charcoal from feature
contexts, as compared to a total of 1.1 grams of charcoal from non-feature
column samples.

fragments came from three samples in Feature 8/9 located in Trench 8, Unit 12,
level 4. The prickly pear seed was noted in a single column sample from Trench
8, Unit 12, level 2. Hackberry seeds were the most widespread of the edible
plant remains, appearing in five samples. Like the other edible remains, the
hackberry seeds were taken from Trench 8, Unit 12.

It is clear from the tables that the locus defined by Feature 8/9 contains most of
the evidence for plant preparation activities. The bulb fragments and the
hackberry seeds are located in level 4 inside the area defined by the feature.
Beyond this area, charcoal weights are much lower and seed plant food remains
are scarce. Feature 5 contains a quantity of woody legume root charcoal, and
Feature 7 contains concentrations of mesquite charcoal. The root charcoal may
constitute evidence for root mining, that is, the recovery of root wood from cut
banks or other exposures to be used for fuel.
The identifications from the 14C/macrobotanical samples mirror the results of
the flotation samples. Mesquite or woody legume wood charcoal was identified
in samples from Features 7, 8, and 8/9. Mesquite was the most abundant wood
type in flotation samples from each of those features. Mesquite root was
identified from Features 5, 8, and 8/9, more evidence of the use of this resource.
Table 4 lists the presence values for plant resources both food and fuel, noted in
the flotation samples. The presence value of a taxon is a measure of number or
percentage of samples in which that resource appears, and it gives an
impression of how widespread each taxon is at the site. Presence value does not
provide a measure of abundance so I have added the total weight of each taxon
in the last column of Table 4.
Hackberry seed fragments were the most widespread of the edible plant remains.
Although hackberry is often intrusive, the seeds or nutlets are calcareous and
resist weathering, I have only included charred seed fragments. Bulb fragments
occurred in almost 10% of the samples, and prickly pear in 3.1% of the flotation
samples.
Site Comparisons. The recovery of bulb fragments from three flotation samples
expands the understanding of land use along the southern edge of the Edwards
Plateau, confirming results of previous botanical analysis conducted on samples
from two other sites in the region. The materials were identified in samples
collected from the Woodrow Heard site (41UV88), and the Heard Schoolhouse
site (41UV86), both located on the southern scarp of the Edwards Plateau.

Macrobotanical samples from the Heard Schoolhouse site included sotol/yucca
fiber-vascular bundles, walnut, hackberry (possibly modern), acorn fragments,
pecan fragments, cheno-am seeds, prickly pear, and grass seed. Wood types
included oak, juniper, pine, sycamore, and acacia (Dering 1997:583). No
mesquite was identified in the samples, but woody or arboreal legume was
present and this may represent mesquite. The lack of a positive identification
for mesquite is intriguing. If mesquite trees were abundant in prehistory, the
wood should have been utilized for fuel often enough to gain a positive
identification of the charcoal. Instead, it appears that oak was much more
available than mesquite in the immediate area of the Heard Schoolhouse site.
At the Woodrow Heard site (41UV88) sotol/yucca, pecan, acorn fragments, grass
seed, and a bulb fragment (lily family, cf. onion) were noted in the samples
(Decker et al. 2000:169). Wood types included oak, juniper/pine, woody
legume, elm, and persimmon. The bulb fragment was located between the
excavated BRM and Feature 3, in a mixed context ambiguously dated to the Late
Archaic - Late Prehistoric periods (3500-300 B.P). Pine wood was noted from
both sites, providing evidence that the relict populations of pinyon located in
this area may have been more widespread during the middle Holocene.
The inhabitants of both 41UV86 and 41UV88 were focusing on many resources
available in streamside and canyon environments available along the Plateau's
southern rim, including woodland mast products from the canyons and
resources associated with open or hillside habitats such as sotol/yucca. Earth
ovens at this site may have been utilized for cooking both bulbs and sotol/yucca
hearts or central stems.
The Heard Schoolhouse site (41UV86), where
yucca/sotol fragments were identified, was a fairly massive burned rock midden
measuring 200 - x - 100 meters, with deepest deposits in a 25- x - 25 meter
area. Nine features were described from the site; Features 3, 4, 7/8, and 9
appear to be large enough to be the heating elements of earth ovens (Creel and
Goode 1997:219).
Although the species identified from the three sites are similar, mesquite was
the most abundant type at 41UV68, but oak was by far the most abundant at
both the Woodrow Heard and Heard Schoolhouse sites. The wood types from
the Heard Schoolhouse reflect a mix of species that grow at higher elevations
along the southern escarpment, while the wood charcoal taxa from 41UV68,
dominated by mesquite, have South Texas Plains vegetation signature.

ETHNOHISTORICAL RECORDS
The records from southern Texas and adjacent Mexico present at least a partial
view of plant use in the region.
In 1674, priests sent to monitor and
communicate with the numerous groups living in the region ran out of supplies
and ate mescal (agave), sotol, tules or cattail, and roots, just like the Indians
(Wade 2003:9-10).
Cabeza de Vaca emphasizes the importance of roots,
particularly in the winter (Adorno and Pautz 2003:114). Unfortunately, the
accounts do not identify the roots, however accounts that document winter use
of roots can not be referring to onion. Therefore, the archeological record
expands the list of the plant resources that Native Americans used.

One of the priests, Manuel de la Cruz, kept a record of a journey from northern
Mexico to an area north and east of the Anacacho Mountains. North of the Rio
Grande they encountered a river lined with nut-bearing trees, most likely pecan,
apparently reaching the Nueces River. Skirting the north side of the Anacacho
Mountains, he backtracked to Santa Rosa southwest of modern day Eagle Pass.
While still north of the river, he ate small beadlike fruits that Indian children
gathered for him; these were probably the fruit of lotebush or condalia, both
extremely common in the region. He reported seeing abundant herds of buffalo
in the plains on either side of the Rio Grande (Wade 2003:13).
Prickly pear fields in southern Texas are prominent in many ethnohistorical
accounts (Adorno and Pautz 2003:111-112; Wade 2003:63, 106).
Most
interesting is the description of the negotiations between the Spanish and a
Lipan Apache group. The Lipan group wanted to settle at the mission Nuestra
Senora de la Candelaria, located near Montell, Texas north of Uvalde. The head
of the small group, El Turnio, requested that he be allowed to leave the area
during the prickly pear harvest. This emphasizes the importance of prickly pear
in the foragers' annual round (Wade 2003:194).

CONCLUSIONS
The botanical analysis of 32 flotation samples and seven 14C/macrobotanical
samples were submitted for identification yielded evidence for the use of three
edible plant resources and three wood types. Hackberry seed fragments, prickly
pear seeds, and geophyte/bulb fragments, probably of wild onion were
identified. Some of the hackberry seed fragments were charred, and both the
prickly pear seeds and the bulb fragments were charred. Oak, mesquite, and
woody legume-type were present, but mesquite was the most abundant of the
wood-types.
Comparison with two other sites illuminates the nature of land use in the
region. Although oak wood charcoal is common at other archeological sites
located along the southern escarpment, mesquite was the fuel of choice at
41UV68. Since fuel wood is seldom transported long distances, it seems likely
that the dominance of mesquite is a reflection of local vegetation conditions at
41UV68. Prickly pear, sotol and lechuguilla, and root foods were important
dietary components.
With the identification of onion bulbs from 41UV68, geophytes now have been
recovered from two sites in Uvalde County. In this area earth ovens were used
for geophytes as well as cooking sotol or lechuguilla. Likewise, the ethnohistoric
record notes the use of root foods as well as their preparation in earth ovens,
but does not identify or describe them beyond noting the unpleasant taste. The
archeological record reflects the use of geophytes (bulbs), a resource which was
most likely cooked in earth ovens. Prickly pear seeds, identified at the Heard
Schoolhouse site, were also noted in the current study. Ethnohistoric accounts
corroborate the importance of the prickly pear fruit harvest to the foragers of the
region.
