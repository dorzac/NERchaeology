ABSTRACT

Wynne-Jackson and Matthews Southwest are preparing to construct the
Wynnewood Park marina on US Army Corps of Engineers property at
Lake Lewisville. The Corps of Engineers requested that an archaeological
survey be conducted and AR Consultants, Inc. conducted the survey in
February of 2008.
A records research did not reveal any historic or prehistoric cultural
resources in the study area but did indicate that the entire tract had been
surveyed for archaeological sites and none were found. No archaeological
resources were found on the surface of the 26 acre survey area and shoveltesting failed to locate any buried cultural resources. This confirms the
results of the previous surveys. The absence of historic occupation is
attributed to land use as farmland. Likewise, it appears that the immediate
area was not occupied prehistorically.
Based on the field investigation, it is AR Consultant’s recommendation
that no further cultural resource investigations are warranted on this
property and that construction of the marina and associated facilities
should be allowed to proceed. The Fort Worth District of the US Army
Corps of Engineers should be advised if buried cultural resources are
uncovered during construction, and, if found, construction should cease
immediately in that area until proper investigations can be carried out.

INTRODUCTION
Wynne-Jackson and Matthews Southwest intends to construct a marina and associated
facilities on approximately 26 acres along Lake Lewisville’s shoreline in The Colony
which is located in Denton County, Texas. The study area is approximately 2,085 feet
west of Boyd Road and south and west of Ragan Road. In the past, the study area was
bounded to the south and southeast by Boyd Road (Figure 1). However, the section of the
road shown n the 1960 USGS map no longer exists. The southern and southeastern
boundaries consist of a golf course. During the middle of February of 2008, AR
Consultants, Inc. conducted an intensive pedestrian archaeological survey of the proposed
development tract. The archaeological survey was done for Carter & Burgess, Inc. which
is doing the environmental permitting for Wynne-Jackson and Matthews Southwest.
The purpose of the archaeological survey was to determine if cultural materials were
present, and, if so, make recommendations about their significance and how they might
be impacted by construction. This archaeological survey was required by the Fort Worth
District of the US Army Corps of Engineers. The Archeology Division of the Texas
Historical Commission will act as the Section 106 review agency.
The archaeological survey was conducted as part of the environmental review needed to
meet relevant federal legislative requirements. These include legislation such as the
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515), the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), the Archeological and Historical
Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93-291), Executive Order No. 11593
“Protection and Enhancement of the Cultural Environment” and Procedures for the
Protection of Historic and Cultural Properties (36CFR800), Appendix C.
The following report contains a brief description of the natural environment, the culture
history and then a review of previous investigations in the area. This is followed by the
research design and methodology. The description of the archaeologically surveyed tract
constitutes the major part of this report. Recommendations are contained in the final
chapter. A list of references cited concludes the report. This report was written in
accordance with the guidelines for reports adopted by the Texas Historical Commission,
Archeology Division, and developed by the Council of Texas Archeologists (ND).

NATURAL SETTING
Denton County is located in North Central Texas. It is bisected by the sandy soil of the
Eastern Cross Timbers. The western portion of the county is covered by the black soil of
the Fort Worth Prairie and the eastern part consists of the rich, black soil of the Blackland
Prairie in which the study area lies. The county is drained by the Elm Fork of the Trinity
River and several major creeks.
The underlying geology of the study area is mapped as the Upper Cretaceous-aged Eagle
Ford Formation which consists of shale (Bureau of Economic Geology 1967). The soil
association in which the study area lies is the Branyon-Burleson-Heiden which consists
of nearly level to moderately steep upland savannah clays (Ford and Pauls 1980:General
Soils Map). Specific soils within the study area consist of Altoga silty clay with 3 to 5
percent slopes along Lake Lewisville’s shoreline and Heiden clay with 1 to 3 percent
slopes between the lake shore and the generally level upland soil which consists of
Branyon clay with 0 to 1 percent slopes (Ford and Pauls 1980:Sheet 35).
The upland surface has been cleared of most trees and supports Bermuda and other
grasses that have been invaded by mesquites. The edge of the upland and the valley
support numerous young and old trees including bois d’arc, American elm, cedar elm,
hackberry, honey locust along with various weeds and masses of greenbriars. According
to various authors, including Lynott (1979), the prairie once supported a cover of tall
grasses and was inhabited by now absent herbivores including bison and antelope.
Certainly, deer inhabited the floodplain forests, but this environment is not present in the
survey area.
A consensus about the paleoenvironmental conditions of North Central Texas over the
past 12,000 years has not been reached. Discussions by Prikryl (1993), Ferring and Yates
(1997), Humphrey and Ferring (1994), and Brown (1998) offer disparate interpretations
based on different analytical approaches. The following discussion relies heavily on
Ferring’s investigations and focuses upon the past two thousand years. Correlating
periods of rapid alluviation with higher precipitation and slow alluviation with drier
conditions, Ferring has concluded that the Late Holocene [5000 yr B.P. to the present]
was a wet period with moderate alluviation, except for a dry period between 2000 to 1000
yr B.P. [A.D. 1-1000]. It was during this dry period that the West Fork Paleosol was
established on the stable surfaces of the river meanders along the Upper Trinity and its
tributaries. This interpretation is supported by changing patterns seen in stable isotope
analysis. Brown (1998) offers a differing interpretation based on isotopic analyses of
mussel shells from a prehistoric site (41DL270) on Denton Creek. He concludes that the
period from 1500 to 2500 yr B.P. was cooler and/or wetter and that before and after the
environment was warmer and drier, but he points out that this interpretation may only be
applicable for the Elm Fork tributary and not the region.

CULTURE HISTORY
The history and prehistory of this part of Denton County are summarized in several
reports prepared by the University of North Texas (Lebo and Brown 1990; Ferring and
Yates 1998). Prehistoric Native American settlement in Denton County began at least
10,000 years ago as attested to by the presence of distinctively shaped dart points (Crook
and Harris 1957) at the Lewisville site and the Aubrey Clovis site (Ferring 2001).
Moreover, artifact collectors report the presence of Clovis, Folsom, Scottsbluff and other
Paleo-Indian points from the surface of sites in the region. The presence of exotic, i.e.,
non-local, lithic resources indicates that these early people traveled through a territory
where higher quality lithics were available or were involved in a system of raw material
trading. These early people hunted now-extinct large game, but probably also foraged off
the land.
The subsequent period, the Archaic, lasted from 7,000 or 6,000 B.C. to possibly as late as
A.D. 700-800. The Archaic peoples lived throughout the counties but particularly along
the major and minor stream valleys where they were able to hunt and gather native foods.
Dart points, grinding stones, fire-cracked rock, and scrapers are common artifacts found
at Archaic sites. The earliest Archaic peoples continued making and using exotic cherts
for dart points, but as time passed, there was a shift toward the use of local lithics for
chipped stone tools. These local materials are described as Uvalde Gravels (Menzer and
Slaughter 1971; Byrd 1971). Large Archaic sites are generally located on terraces or
ridges that overlook the Elm Fork of the Trinity. Smaller lithic scatters have been
recorded in upland areas throughout the county. These sites appear to be Archaic in age,
but none have been thoroughly studied.
About A.D. 700 to 800, a major change is found in the artifacts and settlement patterning
of the prehistoric sites. This is attributed to the drying up of the smaller tributaries.
During this period, which is known as the Late Prehistoric, Caddoan pottery from East
Texas appears as trade material along with the indigenous Nocona Plain pottery. It has
been suggested that farming may have been practiced. Arrowheads appear about this
same time and apparently the bow and arrow had been added to the hunting tool kit.
At the end of the Late Prehistoric period, there appears to have been a general
abandonment of the north-central Texas area based on an absence of sites with trade
goods that might have been obtained from French, Spanish or English traders (Skinner
1988). This simplistic interpretation is tied to a general drying trend and attempts to
factor in negative information generated by professional and avocational archaeologists
who have conducted numerous site surveys throughout the region (Peter, Cliff and Green
1996:2). There is very little evidence of historic era Native American occupation
anywhere in the region although historic accounts indicate that groups were present in the
early 1800's.
The history of man's presence in North Central Texas continues with the first written
accounts by the French and Spanish explorers. There is tantalizing evidence to the south
in Dallas County of possible visits by Spanish explorers. Current research, however,

seems to indicate that Anglo settlers were the first non-Indians to visit the survey area.
Established European settlement in Denton County began before the mid-1800's with the
establishment of the Peter's Colony after Texas independence. These early settlers were
farmers who selected bottomland along the Elm Fork of the Trinity. The town of Little
Elm was established with a post office in 1845 (Bridges 1978). Commercial farming was
not important until after the Civil War, and the early settlers were essentially selfsufficient. Besides the plants and animals they grew, wild animals and plants were
commonly consumed. Denton became the county seat in 1856. By 1875, cotton, corn, and
wheat were the main cash crops. Up to half of these crops were grown by tenant farmers
who either paid rent to the landowner for their house, tools, and seed or by tenants who
gave the landowner a third of the grain and a quarter of the cotton or other cash crops. By
the turn of the century, all of the major communities had been established and some had
passed away.
Previous Investigations
What is today Lake Lewisville was originally surveyed by Stephenson (1949) as the
Garza-Little Elm Reservoir and 27 sites were recorded. It should be noted that this survey
focused upon recording prehistoric sites. No historic sites were recorded. During dam
construction, what became the Lewisville site (41DN72) was found during a borrow pit
excavation on a terrace 70 feet above the Elm Fork of the Trinity River. Between 1951
and 1957, 21 hearths were discovered as well as Late Pleistocene faunal remains and a
Clovis point. The site dated to approximately 37,000 years BP, but this date has been
questioned. Later testing indicated that lignite contaminated the dated samples. A revised
date of circa 12,000 years BP is attributed to the site (Crook and Harris 1957; Crook and
Harris 1961; Banks 2008).
Nunley (1973) and students from Richland College surveyed the lake edge and recorded
58 historic and prehistoric sites for the US Army Corps of Engineers. Lebo and Brown
(1990) conducted an archaeological survey of approximately 14,000 acres of shoreline
and recorded 151 historic and prehistoric sites, many of which had been recorded by
Stephenson and Nunley. Sites ranged in age from the Archaic to 1950. Thirty-nine of the
sites were recommended for further testing which was done the next year (Brown and
Lebo 1991). Of the 39 sites, 5 were then recommended for intense testing which was
done in 1997 (Ferring and Yates 1998).
Prior to the current field survey, records were checked with Texas Historical
Commission’s Archeological Sites Atlas (2008). Historic maps, including the 1918 Soil
Map of Denton County (Carter and Beck 1918) and the R. King Harris’ map (1936) were
also reviewed. No archaeological sites or historic residences were shown on the maps.
However, according to the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas, the study area has been
surveyed twice for the US Army Corps of Engineers. The study area was surveyed by
Southern Methodist University (Cliff and Moir 1985) for a golf course. Two historic
farmsteads (41DN279 and 280) are recorded approximately a mile south of the study area
but no sites were found in the study area. In 1990, the University of North Texas (Lebo

and Brown 1990) surveyed Lake Lewisville’s shoreline adjacent to the study area but
recorded no archaeological sites within the study area.
AR Consultants, Inc. (Todd and Skinner 2002) conducted an archaeological survey about
4 miles northwest of the study area of a proposed toll road that extended from Lake
Lewisville’s shore line to IH 35E but failed to discover any archaeological sites. Also,
AR Consultants, Inc. (Trask and Skinner 2002) conducted an archaeological survey along
Hackberry Branch and Stewart Creek approximately four miles northeast of the study
area but failed to discover any archaeological sites. A similar project was investigated by
AR Consultants, Inc. (Todd 2007) approximately 1.8 miles northwest of the study area in
a similar setting but did not discover any archaeological sites.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY

Research Design
The purpose of the research design below is to insure that fieldwork will contribute to
better understanding of prehistoric and historic settlement in Denton County. Geographic
locations for sites found in Lebo and Brown’s (1990) research and Ferring and Yates
(1998) excavation of five sites in the Lake Lewisville area suggest that sites are found on
benches, their toes, and knolls adjacent to the Elm Fork of the Trinity River or its
tributaries. Historic sites also were found close to the Elm Fork and not along ridges or
the “uplands” away from the river.
The presence of two historic sites south of the study area indicates that historic sites
might be present. However, based on 1918 Soils Map for Denton County, the study area
was located close to the Elm Fork; therefore, a prehistoric site might be present.
Methodology
In order to address these questions, the field personnel, with the aid of appropriate project
system design maps, USGS maps and Denton County soil information, conducted an
intensive pedestrian archaeological survey of the study area. The archaeologists walked
parallel transects spaced approximately 30 m apart from the lake edge upslope. Notes on
the vegetation, soil and other relevant information were taken as were photographs. As
previously stated, only the 26 acres of the study area which was on land was investigated.
The rest of the study area is in Lake Lewisville.
The ground surface was carefully inspected even in areas where visibility was less than
thirty percent. Shovel tests were placed in locations with less than thirty percent ground
visibility and at a rate of one per two acres as recommended by the Council of Texas
Archeologists (2002) in the Blackland Prairie upland setting. Shovel tests were not dug in
mechanically disturbed areas or where ground visibility was greater than 50 percent. Due
to the upland setting, shovel tests were excavated to approximately 30 cm below the
ground surface because cultural materials would deflate onto the ground surface. The
clay which could not be screened manually was broken and visually inspected for cultural
resources.
Deep testing was not done due to the upland setting where no alluvium would have been
present in the past to bury and preserve an archaeological site deposit.

RESULTS
This portion of the report presents a description of the survey area, a discussion of the
survey and the conclusions based upon the survey and information from the surrounding
area. Due to the odd shape of the survey area, it has been broken into two sections, the
shoreline and the area away from the shoreline. Shovel test data are presented in Table 1
and shovel test locations are plotted on Figure 4. The soil matrices were moist when
tested due to recent rain.
The survey area
The survey area contains generally level terrain that either drops suddenly in elevation or
moderately slopes to the lake. The area away from the study area is in unimproved
pasture. Understory vegetation includes tickle grass, grama grasses, bermuda grass, hog
brush, broom weed, berry vines, grape vines, dandelion and other grass species. Trees
include pecan, eastern red cedar, hackberry, mesquite, American elm, winged elm and
bois d’arc. The typical vegetation away from the lake is shown in Figure 2. Ground
visibility in the area away from the lake ranged from less than 5 to 20 percent. Along the
shoreline, the ground visibility ranged from 30 to nearly 100 percent (Figure 3). The area
away from the lake was bounded by a golf course to the south as was the southern lake
edge. The northern shoreline area runs in front of and from an abandoned house north
into pasture land.

The survey
Lake Lewisville’s shoreline
Survey began at the northernmost boundary of the study area and went south. Although
the shoreline had been previously surveyed, it was intensely investigated, but no cultural
materials older than 50 years were seen on the ground surface despite the excellent
ground visibility. Five shovel tests were excavated along the shore. The shovel tests
uncovered culturally sterile clay ranging in depths from 30-37 cm bs.
The area away from the shoreline
Survey began in the southwest corner and the fourteen transects were oriented east-west
due to the study area’s configuration. Most of the tract recently had been mowed and
sand and gravel were present on the surface which probably was from sand pits on the
adjacent golf course. Ten shovel tests were excavated and uncovered culturally sterile
clay from 29 to 34 cm bs. No cultural materials were seen on the ground surface.

Conclusions
No archaeological sites were found during the intensive pedestrian archaeological survey
of the study area and this confirms the results of previous surveys of this same area. The
absence of historic sites may be that this area was more suitable for farming. This area
previously had been farmed and since that time, it has been maintained as pasture. Thus
the absence of historic structures is to be expected despite the proximity of the Elm Fork
channel. While plowing would have destroyed shallow prehistoric site deposits, there
should be evidence of occupation in the form of lithic debris, fire-cracked rock, chipped
stone tools or pottery if such an occupation was once present. Consequently, it is
concluded that this area also was not occupied prehistorically.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the systematic pedestrian survey and the excavation of 15 shovel tests, it is AR
Consultants’ conclusion that the surveyed area was not occupied prehistorically or
historically and that further archaeological investigations are unwarranted. Thus, WynneJackson and Matthews Southwest should be allowed to proceed with the construction of
the marina and associated facilities. However if buried cultural deposits are encountered
during construction, work should immediately stop in that area and the Fort Worth
District of the US Army Corps of Engineers should be notified.
