INTRODUCTION
As an aspect of an ongoing environmental and archeological service contract with Brazos
Electric Power Cooperative, Inc. (BEPC) of Waco, Hicks & Company (H&C) conducted an
intensive cultural resources survey and assessment of a proposed electric transmission line
reroute project. The construction of this new segment of the Hearne to Branchville 138 KV
transmission line is being necessitated by active lateral erosion by the Brazos River which is
threatening a portion of the existing line. The 60-foot (18-meter) wide impact corridor for the
4.1 mile (6.5 kilometer) construction project crosses the Brazos River (Milam\Robertson county
line) approximately 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) above the confluence of the Brazos and Little rivers
(Figure 1). The majority of the transmission line corridor runs parallel to and between 100-300
feet (30-90 meters) from Farm to Market Road 483 (Figure 1). The entire impact area
encompasses 30 acres. Single wooden poles will predominantly be used to support the electric
conductors and insulators (BEPC 1992). At certain locations, H-frame towers necessitating .two
poles will be used. The poles will be emplaced in holes that will be approximately 30 inches
(76 centimeters) in diameter with the depth of the holes ranging from 5.5 feet (1.6 meters) to
11 feet {3.4 meters), depending upon the height of the pole.
Cultural resources are tangible expressions of human cultural diversity, both present and
past. As such, they are an important part of the nation's heritage and have been singled out for
protection in legislation at every level of government. Significant cultural resource sites may
be protected by Federal law, primarily the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA),
which is invoked when Federal funds are utilized or when Federal permitting is required for a
proposed project. The NHP A created the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and
states that the Advisory Council for Historic Preservation (ACHP) must be afforded the
opportunity to comment when any cultural resources potentially eligible for inclusion on the
NRHP are present in an area affected by Federal agency actions or actions funded or permitted
by Federal agencies. The Federal regulatory process is described in detail in the ACHP
regulation 36 CFR 800. Protection of cultural resources under Federal law is tied to eligibility
for the NRHP which depends on site "significance" as defined by National Park Service (NPS)
rule 36 CFR 60.
The Federal cultural resource regulatory agency in Texas is the Texas Historical
Commission Department of Antiquities Protection (THCDAP). This regulatory group is funded
by Federal monies administered through the NPS. As the proposed construction of this electric
transmission line falls under the licensing purview of the Rural Electrification Administration
(REA), a Federal agency, this archeological project must comply with the standards and
guidelines of the Section 106 review process, implemented through THCDAP. As a part of that
compliance process, this report will be submitted to the THCDAP for review and comments
prior to the initiation of construction activities.
This cultuqil resource investigation was designed to comply with standard archeological
survey methods as defined in the Department of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines (NPS
1983), the Council of Texas Archeologists Guidelines (CTA 1987), and the regulations

implementing the Texas Antiquities Code (13 TAC 41). The survey was intended to do the
following:
1)

Identify cultural resources located within the project area;

2)

Describe the setting, nature, extent and condition of such resources;

3)

Evaluate, insofar as possible on the survey level, identified resources in terms of
their potential eligibility for the NRHP; and

4)

Provide recommendations for further evaluation of any newly identified,
potentially significant resources or, in the case of known significant resources,
provide recommendations for various resource management options such as
preservation or data recovery.

The fieldwork, totaling 13 person days (including travel time froin Austin), was
conducted on August 3-4, September 2-4, and October 12, 1992. Mike Davis served as Project
Archeologist and was assisted in the field by Terry Jones and David Driver. David Driver
prepared the figures that are presented in the report. Larry Cox of the H&C environmental
group described the soils. Pat Heisler assisted with in-house logistics and report preparation.
The Project Archeologist would like to thank Dave McDaniel, Contract Administrator for BEPC,
and Don McKelvain, Right-of-Way and Claims Agent for BEPC, for logistical support during
the project. Dick Daniels, of Daniels Construction in Hearne, operated the backhoe.

PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

The project area is located in east-central Milam and west-central Robertson counties.
The proposed reroute segment of transmission line will cross the Brazos River, which is the
county line, immediately adjacent (south side) to the Farm to Market Road 485 bridge that spans
the river. This bridge is located 3.3 miles (5.3 kilometers) west of Hearne. Above mean sea
level elevations for the project area range from 280-295 feet (85-90 meters).
In terms of surface geology, the majority of the proposed transmission corridor crosses
floodplain alluvial deposits that are apparently Holocene in age and were derived from the
Brazos, Little, and Little Brazos rivers. Barnes (1981) describes these floodplain deposits as
being comprised of "clay, silt, sand, and gravel; dark gray to brown; sand largely quartz;
gravel, siliceous, mostly chert, quartzite, limestone, and petrified wood". The extreme western
end of the project area crosses an area of relatively elevated fluviatile terrace deposit that is
Pleistocene in age again described as being comprised of varying proportions of "gravel, sand,
silt, and clay, with gravel more prominent in the older, higher terraces" (Barnes 1981).

Detailed soil surveys have not been completed for Robertson or Milam counties, but a
General Soil Map is available for both counties. The soils mapped for the survey area are the
Ships-Weswood association (USDA 1977, 1979). These soils are described as being loamy to
clayey, deep, nearly level, and moderately alkaline. Both of the soils are described as being
reddish brown in color.
The study area is located within Gould and Thomas' (1975) Blackland Prairie vegetation

wne. Hatch, Gandhi, and Brown (1990:2) indicate that the study area is in a transitional wne
between the Blackland Prairies and the Post Oak Savannah. This area is characterized as being
primarily grassland and savannah with riparian woodlands. Within the current project area,
however, decades of agricultural activities have long ago destroyed all native vegetation except
for a corridor of arboreal species, primarily oak, along the river and along property fence lines.
Also, along the fence lines green briar and poison ivy flourish. Local intensive farming has
been prompted by the rich alluvial sediments of the Braws Valley and the flat floodplain
topography across which the proposed transmission line will be built. Agricultural products
being produced in the project area at the time of the survey included milo (maize), com, and
cotton. Certain short stretches of the agricultural areas surveyed were currently fallow and
populated by stands of sunflowers.

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
PREHISTORY
The area under study lies within the transitional zone between the Central and East Texas
archeological regions. As a result, archeological evidence should exhibit characteristics
commonly encountered in both Central and East Texas cultural areas.
The Central Texas area has been the subject of extensive research, enabling the
compilation of well-documented chronological sequences (Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks 1954; Weir
1976; Prewitt 1981, 1985), generally dividing regional human occupation into four broad stages,
Paleoindian, Archaic, Late Prehistoric (or Neoarchaic), and Historic. The archeological record
of the East Texas region has also been the subject of chronological ordering and Story (1981)
has proposed five stages, Paleoindian, Archaic, Early Ceramic, Late Prehistoric, and Historic.
The stages are based on a proposed sequence of economic strategies as they are revealed
through the archeological and/or historical record. These proposed shifts in aboriginal and
Anglo lifeways consider cultural, economic, and technological factors in order to provide a
heuristic model useful for attempting to understand ancient and early historic populations. While
the dates assigned to the period interfaces are based on absolute dating methods, they of course·
represent a generalized time range for the implied cultural evolution/changes. The dates
provided in the following discussion will be drawn from Prewitt (1981, 1985) and Story (1981).
The earliest period of occupation in both Central and East Texas is known as the
Paleoindian stage (circa 12,000-8500 B.P.). During this time, it is proposed that populations
continued with the highly nomadic hunting tradition brought with them from the Old World.
Traditional models emphasize the heavy reliance that these groups placed on hunting of the large
mammals of the Pleistocene. Plant foods and small game undoubtedly supplemented this diet,
and may have played a more important role than previously thought (Black and McGraw 1985).
By circa 10,000 B.P., however, the Late Wisconsin glaciation had ended, creatiiig
extensive changes in the environment. As a result, by the end of this period the majority of
large Pleistocene megafauna were extinct, thus requiring a drastic change in subsistence
strategies. By the Early Archaic, circa 8500-4600 B.P., Central Texas populations had adapted
to the environmental changes by shifting to a lifeway dominated by seasonal scheduling. This
type of subsistence economy specializes in a regionally circumscribed repetitive exploitation of
various floral and faunal resources. This enables populations to fine tune their subsistence
exploitation to their local environment. The resulting intimate knowledge allows for optimal
exploitation of available resources.
By the end of the Early Archaic, a new method for the processing of plant foods had
appeared in Central Texas. Cooking techniques which utilized the heat-retention qualities of
limestone and sandstone became widespread throughout the area. This practice resulted in piles
of burned and fractured stone known as burned rock middens. During the Middle Archaic, circa
5

4600-2250 B.P., the use of this technique appears to have been widespread. Prewitt (1981)
proposes that this innovation in plant food processing allowed population increase as a result of
higher efficiency of resource exploitation. He reports an increase in site frequency to document
such a trend.
By circa 2250 B.P., the Central Texas Late Archaic, the utilization of burned rock
middens reduced in frequency. (Prewitt 1981). During this period, bison appears to have
become an important part of the aboriginal diet. The Late Archaic lasted until circa 1250 B.P.,
the beginning of the Late Prehistoric. This period, known as the Austin phase, is marked by
the introduction of the bow and arrow and the appearance of pottery. The establishment of
cemetery areas became common and possibly indicates a change in the existing cultural patterns.
While the subsistence strategies do not appear to have changed initially, the hunting of bison
again achieved greater importance in the later Toyah phase, circa 650-200 B. P.
In East Texas, the Archaic stage remained relatively stable until the appearance of pottery

at circa 2150 B.P., initiating what is known as the Early Ceramic period (Story 1981). This
stage continued until historic times in the central and southern portions of the region. However,
in northeastern Texas, appearance of the Caddoan culture is recognized by the Late Prehistoric
stage, circa 1250-250 B.P. The Caddo were sedentary agriculturalists. Social stratification of
Caddoan society is indicated both in ethnohistoric accounts and through the intentionally
constructed special-use earth mounds that mark certain of their cultural sites.
As mentioned above, the Post Oak Savannah region, lying between Central and East
Texas, has traditionally been described as a transitional zone between two well defined cultural
areas. Certainly, at almost any site within this transitional area distinctive artifacts can be
isolated that clearly are associated with prehistoric groups in adjoining regions. Most recently,
however, Goode (1989:166) has suggested that regional in situ adaptations, particularly during
the Archaic, may account for many of the lithic artifact types recovered from the area under
discussion:
"In summary, the study area is a natural transition zone, separating diverse
cultures occupying much greater expanses of territory. The multitude of Archaic
projectile-point styles present indicates substantial interaction between resident and
neighboring cultures. However, the preponderance of diagnostic artifacts cannot
be forced into the typologies of Central or East Texas; they should evidently be
ascribed to local traditions".
Further, Goode (1989:166) states that his lithic studies indicate" that an indigenous population
was settled in the area by the Middle Archaic times, probably during the Early Archaic".

HISTORY
Milam County is one of the oldest in the State of Texas. It was created in 1836 and
formally organized in 1837. The modem county seat is at Cameron (Texas Almanac 1976:335).

It has been called the "Mother of Counties," because by the 1870s seventeen new counties were
carved from its original territory (Rock and Smith 1878: 103). Named for Ben Milam, slain hero
of the Texas Revolution, the county has a long, rich history beginning with early Spanish
settlements along the Brazos River, which delineates its boundary with Robertson County to the
east, and along tributaries of the Brazos such as the San Gabriel and Little Rivers.

Spanish Attempts at Colonization
The first attempt at European settlement of the area then known as the Rancheria Grande
was made in early 1746 when Fray Mariano de los Dolores and soldiers from the garrisons of
Las Adaes and La Bahia, together with Indians from San Antonio, erected temporary buildings
and planted their first crop on the banks of the San Gabriel (then called the San Xavier) River
near present-day Rockdale. Mission San Francisco Xavier was formally founded there, with
permission of the king, in February of 1748, though unofficially it had been a going concern for
almost two years (Bolton 1970:48).
Two other missions were authorized in the area: San Ildefonso, established in February
1749, and Nuestra Senora de la Candelaria, founded by May of that year. The three missions
were located on the south bank of the San Xavier (San Gabriel) River above the confluence of
Brushy Creek, then known as Arroyo de las Animas. San Francisco Xavier was on Kolb's Hill
with the other two missions nearby on either side (Bolton 1970:50).
Indians groups were assigned to the three missions based on linguistic affiliation. Indians
originally considered to be Tonkawan stock, including the Mayeye, the Hierbipiame, and the
Yojuane, lived at San Francisco Xavier. Atakapan speakers, including the Bidai, Deadose, and
Orcoquiza, were assigned to Ildefonso. The Coco and other Karankawa tribes were sent to
Nuestra Senora de la Candelaria (Bolton 1970:50).
When the surveyor, Lieutenant Jose de Bea y Musquiz inspected the missions in July
1750, he found three churches with 480 Indians in residence. Although they were prey to
smallpox and hostile Indians, hopes remained high among the missionaries.
In December 1751, Captain Felipe de Rabago Teran arrived with· his company of fifty
presidia! troops and authorization to begin construction of a presidio for the protection of the
missions. Teran was not optimistic about the chances of these missions, favoring a location
closer to San Antonio. This attitude soon brought him into conflict with the priests. Although
the charges were never proven, in May 1752 he was implicated in the murder of Father Juan
Joseph Ganzabel and another citizen.
Constantly exposed to depredations of the Apaches and chronically short of supplies and
garrison troops, the missions were abandoned in 1755 when those who still remained removed
to the springs of the San Marcos River. So ended the first attempt at European colonization in
the area later known as Milam County. Archeological investigations have located what is
believed to be the site of Mission San Francisco Xavier de Horcasitas (Gilmore 1969).

Mexican Independence and Anglo Colonization
Following Mexico's independence from Spain in 1821 the government in Mexico City
looked northward to Texas and saw a wilderness filled with barbarians which they had the means
neither to conquer nor to convert. Although somewhat suspicious and apprehensive of the
intentions of Anglo-American citizens already settling in Texas, these newcomers seemed
preferable to the Apaches and Comanches. On April 14, 1823, Congress granted Stephen F.
Austin permission to establish a colony of three hundred families in Texas (Richardson, Wallace,
and Anderson 1981:61).
The Texas Association of Nashville, or the Nashville Company secured a contract for the
settlement of 800 families in 1825. The new colony was named after the company's agent,
Sterling C. Robertson (Richardson, Wallace, and Anderson 1981:64). Legal squabbles began
almost immediately with Austin and his partner, Samuel Williams. The colony changed hands
three times before a Texas court finally ruled Robertson's claim valid in 1847, after his death
(Richardson, Wallace, and Anderson 1981:69).
Tenoxtitlan de Tejas sprang up after Colonel Francisco Rui'z established a Mexican Army
garrison north of Caldwell in what is now Burleson County in July 1830 (Milam County
Heritage Preservation Society 1984:7). One of the early residents was James Monroe Swisher,
who later became Treasurer and County Clerk for Travis· County and a member of the· Texas
Legislature (Jenkins 1987:267). It did not prove to be a viable town and was soon eclipsed by
surrounding communities.
Nashville was the headquarters of the Nashville Company and after the Texas Revolution
became the county seat. An anonymous traveller passing through the area in 1837 described it
as "a sniall place, high in the interior" (Muir 1958: 123), but it was a growing town. A
geographer wrote in 1840 that:
·
Nashville, on the west bank of the Brazos (the place is called Viesca on the map)
is now the county seat, and the principal town in the county. It contains four
hundred souls and is one of the most delightful situations in Texas. It has an
abundance of fine water, and is very healthy. Tenoxtitlan, twelve miles below,
is an old Mexican station, but is now nearly deserted. It contains but four or five
houses (Moore 1965:99).

Port Sullivan
In the early days of the republic there were hopes of steamboat navigation up the Brazos
River as far as the falls below the modem town of Marlin. In 1843, taking advantage of heavy
rains, the steamboat "Mustang" travelled up the river as far as some high limestone cliffs known
as Sullivan's Bluff (Breckman 1968). A few years later, probably in 1846 (some say 1849 or
1850), the steamboat "Washington" sailed past Nashville and up the Little River as far as the
town of Cameron, where it took on supplies and headed back downstream, never to return

(Walker 1947:243-44). Still, dreams of a watery highway into the heartland of Texas continued,
and in 1851 Augustus W. Sillaven (other sources say "Sullivan"), who had located on the
limestone bluffs near the confluence of the Little and Brazos Rivers in 1835, began to sell lots
in his new town, ambitiously dubbed Port Sullivan. Though other steamboats occasionally
braved the river as far as Port Sullivan, it was never a regular port of call (Baker 1986: 115).
A reporter describing the town in 1852 said that it included four stores, some
warehouses, a sawmill, two blacksmith shops, three carpenters, several doctors, and a lawyer,
with a population of around two hundred (Galveston Weekly Journal, November 5, 1852).
Port Sullivan Male and Female College was founded in 1860 and operated until the late
1870s under the auspices of the Methodist Church and the direction of Joseph P. Sneed (Baker
1986: 116; Webb 1952 II:395). It was founded by the Reverend and Mrs. Carver. Dr. Church,
a Methodist preacher, was president in 1864, followed by Colonel William W. Fontaine in 1871
(Milam County Heritage Preservation Society 1984:26). Fontaine, a well-known educator in
early Texas, would go on to found the Texas Female Institute in Austin in 1875 (Barkley
1981:172). In 1878 the school's president was Captain John D. Morrison (Milam County
Heritage Preservation Society 1984:26).
Port Sullivan Baptist Church was founded on August 27, 1864 by Rufus C. Burleson, a
circuit-riding preacher who is famous for founding Baylor College in Independence, which he
later moved to Waco to become today's Baylor University (Batte 1956: 191; Walker 1897).
A Masonic Lodge was started in Port Sullivan in 1856 (Baker 1986: 116). By 1858 there
was a post office. In 1860 W. W. Duncan of Tennessee ran a successful store there (Batte
1956:52-53). Josiah Lester had a thousand head of cattle and F. M. Hall owned a flock of
twelve hundred sheep, the largest in the county (Batte 1956:58-59) The town was growing
steadily when on the twelfth of April 1861 an artillery bombardment of Fort Sumter began the
American Civil War. Milam County voters supported secession and many of Port Sullivan's
young men marched away, never to see the Brazos again.
When the town's surviving Confederate soldiers straggled back after the Civil War, there
were hopes of a railroad and the future seemed bright; however, the scheme never came to
fruition. In 1870 the town could boast 1,423 inhabitants (United States Census Department
1870:782-83), but the International and Great Northern Railway bypassed Port Sullivan and the
place began to wither. By 1880 there were only 123 people left (United States Census
Department 1871:805). An 1895 description of Milam County does not even mention it.
There are ten towns in the county: Cameron, the county seat has a population of
3200; Rockdale, 2000; Milano, 500; Davilla, 500; Maysfield, 200; Gause, 250;
Baileyville, 250; Minerva, 100; Ben Arnold, 250; Buckholts, 200 (Clark, Coats
1895).
There was no longer a polling place for voters by the time of the 1898 county elections

(Cameron Weekly Herald, November 24, 1898:3). In 1910, the Army Corps of Engineers built
concrete locks on the river at Port Sullivan, still dreaming of commercial navigation. It was
another plan that in the end came to nothing (Baker 1986: 115). By 1940 the town had forty
residents (Webb 1952 II:395) and the population had dwindled to around twenty inhabitants by
1949 (Lengert 1949: 180).

PREVIOUS ARCHEOWGICAL INVFSTIGATIONS
The project area lies in the southwestern portion of Robertson County and the
northeastern portion of Milam County within the drainage basins of the Brazos, Little Brazos
and Little Rivers. Prior to the 1970s, archeological research in this area had been limited. For
example, before 1974 only one archeological site had been reported from Robertson County
(TARL files). However, beginning in the mid-1970s, the development of several mining and
reservoir projects required extensive archeological assessment studies in the area. A brief
review of several of these previous archeological investigations is presented below.
An early extensive archeological investigation in the Robertson County area was in
response to the planned construction of the Upper Navasota Reservoir, later to be called Lake
Limestone. Survey of the area by the Texas Archeological Survey in 1974 recorded 52
archeological sites (Prewitt 1974). Excavations indicated that the area had been occupied from
the Late Paleoindian to the Late Prehistoric (Prewitt 1975). Important cultural features included
burned rock concentrations and the occurrence of Caddoan ceramics.
A series of archeological investigations took place in the Twin Oaks project area of
northern Robertson County between 1974 and 1985 (Prewitt and Grombacher 1974; Turpin and
Kluge 1980). A total of 100 archeological sites were recorded, and several excavated. The
majority of these sites were described as light lithic scatters located near permanent water
supplies (Turpin and Kluge 1980). Recovered diagnostics indicate the area was inhabited from
the Middle Archaic to the Late Prehistoric. East Texas influence is suggested by a number of
East Texas Archaic (La Harpe Aspect) projectile points (Turpin and Kluge 1980).
Surveys in central Robertson County in 1978 in preparation for the Calvert and Cole
Creek lignite mines located 61 prehistoric and 31 historic sites (Good, Turpin, and Freeman
1980). The prehistoric sites ranged from Paleoindian to Late Prehistoric in age. These sites
were concentrated along the tributary system of the Brazos River. By 1985, a shift in the
proposed location of the Calvert Prospect required a new series of archeological surveys (Davis
et al. 1987). As a result, 32 prehistoric and 46 historic sites were located in northwest
Robertson County. Of the prehistoric sites, all were located on either Walnut Creek or along
one of its tributaries.
Extensive archeological work in Leon, Freestone, and Limestone counties immediately
to the north and east of Robertson County was undertaken in preparation for the Jewett Mine
Project (Espey, Huston and Associates, Inc. 1980a, 1980b, 1980c, 1982; Fields et al. 1986).
The various investigations between 1979 and 1984 located 134 prehistoric and 141 historic sites.
Recovered diagnostics date the prehistoric sites from the Late Paleoindian to the Late
Prehistoric.
To the south of the study area, excavations at site 41BU16 were conducted in 1984
(Roemer and Carlson 1987). The site is located along the Brazos River, approximately three
kilometers from its confluence with the Little Brazos River. The site dates from the Middle

Archaic to the Late Prehistoric. The culturally transitional nature of the area is illustrated by
the variety of artifact forms (Roemer and Carlson 1987: 116-119).
In response to a proposed BEPC electric utility development, Hicks & Company
conducted a survey of the site of a proposed electric substation in Milam County, 5 kilometers
southeast of Thorndale. The impact area was located on an unnamed tributary of Salty Creek,
which is a tributary of Brushy Creek. The project entailed both shovel probes and a surface
survey. A single chert flake and mortared brick fragments were observed on the surface at
different locations within the project area; however, the ephemeral and apparently disturbed
context of these materials negated additional work. No archeological sites were documented
(Brown and Anthony 1991).
Two prehistoric sites have been documented adjacent to the west end of the project area
(TARL files). Site 41MM214 was originally recorded in 1985 by Bradley Bowman, an
avocational archeologist then living in Bryan. The site, named Cobb's Sandhill, was described
as being in a plowed field located on a west bank terrace of the Brazos River. The site limits
were estimated to be 200 by 250 feet (61 x 76 m). A surface collection yielded Pedemales,
Ensor, Dari, Perdiz, and Scallorn projectile points, indicating aboriginal activity at the site from
the Middle Archaic to the Late Prehistoric periods. Sandy paste ceramic sherds were also
collected.
In 1990, as an aspect of the cultural resources survey by the Texas Department of
Transportation prior to the expansion of Farm to Market Road 485 the site form was updated
by a TxDoT archeologist (TARL files). On the new form the site limits were estimated to be
approximately 50 meters square. Aboriginal cultural materials were observed on the surface of
the site and in cutbank profiles to an estimated depth of 50 centimeters. Chipped stone materials
reported included flakes, core fragments, and biface fragments, possibly reflecting that more
diagnostic materials were no longer present at the site. Following the current policy of the
TxDoT, no formal recommendations for the site were included on the site data form; however,
the TxDot project archeologist feels that the site would warrant testing if subsurface impacts
should occur (Hickman 1992).
Also in 1985, Bradley Bowman recorded 41MM215, Cobb's Bottom Site, which is
located only 2000 feet (610 m) to the south of the current survey area (TARL files). Site limitS
were estimated to be 100 by 2000 feet (30 x 6!0 m). Archeological materials collected from
the site included Pedemales, Morrill, Kent, Perdiz, and Scallorn projectile points and sandy
paste pottery fragments. Soils across the site limits varied from red clays to sand. A large
outcrop of chert gravels was also present at the site.

SURVEY METHODS
Prior to the initiation of the fieldwork, the Milam and Robertson County files, housed
at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) at The University of Texas at Austin,
were searched to determine if previously recorded sites were present in the project area and to
learn what types of cultural resources had been identified in the region of the pending
archeological assessment. No previously recorded cultural resources were present within the
current project area; however, one prehistoric archeological site, 41MM214, was located on a
rise on the opposite (north) side of FM 485 from the western terminus of the impact corridor.
The 1936 Milam and Robertson County Highway Maps were also reviewed to determine
if structures were present within the project area at the time that the map was compiled.
Similarly, the listings of the NRHP (Steely 1984; THC files) and Medallion Historical Markers
were searched for sites in the project area or vicinity. Other historic information on the project
area was obtained at the Lorenzo de Zavala State Archives, located in Austin. Of particular
interest in terms of potential historic resources, archival research indicated that the town of Port
Sullivan had been situated on the north side of FM 485 in close proximity to the survey area.
The fieldwork entailed an intensive pedestrian transect surface survey of the entire
proposed transmission line corridor. Two archeologists accomplished this task by walking the
entire impact area in intervals spaced at 10-15 meters. When possible, these transects were
walked in a zig-zag manner so that a maximum area of ground would be crossed, thereby
increasing the area that was actually inspected. Portions of the area surveyed were planted in
row crops (cotton, corn) and in these locations only one of the archeologist walked a transect
through the cultivated area. The other surveyor concentrated on turn rows and highway ditch
areas that were immediately adjacent and parallel to the transect areas planted in cash crops.
It is felt that this was adequate coverage for the proposed impact area because decades of
agricultural activity would have spread any cultural remains present over wide areas and
visibility was in fact better along the right-of-ways than in the crop rows.
Location of and orientation within the study area was done through the use of a 7.5
minute United States Geological Survey (USGS) topographic maps (Gause and Calvert quads).
Additionally, the centerline of the transmission line had been staked on the ground at various
intervals by the BEPC engineering survey team, making orientation along the line quite easy.
During the latter of the project, the archeologists also were furnished a scale plan and profile
map for the construction project.
Shovel testing was conducted to searc~ for possibly buried cultural deposits. These
probes were dug at points deemed by the field archeologists to represent high probability
locations for the presence of historic debris or aboriginal occupation and where the geologic
setting was aggrading. Because of the intractable nature of the clayey soils that were
encountered during the shovel testing effort, it was necessary to use a 7-foot (2.1-meter) long
steel digging bar to brake loose the soil before it was possible to shovel the dirt into a screen.
The probes were oval to round in plan, ranging from 45-50 centimeters is diameter. The depths

of the probes varied with the perceived potential for soil accumulation from one topographic
setting to another, but they generally extended to between 95 and 100 centimeters below surface.
Excavated soil was placed in a 1\4 inch screen but again because of the extreme compactness
of the soil it was not possible to completely screen the matrix in the traditional manner. Large
clods were broken open by hand or though the use of applied force with a wooden stake. The
smaller clods were then visually inspected for possible cultural materials. Locations of the
probes were plotted on the USGS topographic sheets.
Because of positive results in certain shovel tests, it was determined that backhoe
trenching should be conducted in select locations. This decision was further predicated by the
feeling that these same areas had a potential for buried cultural materials at subsurface depths
greater than the standard one meter of shovel probes. The backhoe trenches were all 24 inches
(60 centimeters) wide. Soil samples were taken from natural stratigraphic levels in the backhoe
trenches to be returned to the Hicks & Company laboratory for description by the in-house soil
scientist. The samples were also taken for possible submittal for soil humate assay in the event
that it was determined that the BEPC construction project was to adversely impact significant
archeological remains. Profile drawing were done of one-meter wide swaths in select backhoe
trenches.
Documentation for the project includes a daily journal
documentation with attendant photo log of the project area.
Archeological Site Data Form was completed for the single new
formally recorded at the TARL. Cultural materials recovered
curated at TARL.

SURVEY RESULTS
The cultural resources survey for this proposed BEPC construction project resulted in the
expansion of the horizontal limits of a previously recorded prehistoric site (41MM214) and the
identification and documentation of a single new cultural resource (41MM303). Additionally,
the subsurface discovery of a 19th century glass artifact was investigated; however, no
archeological site was identified.
Site 41MM214 (See Previous Investigations) was originally recorded as being confined
to the upper portion of a rise that is located on the opposite side of FM 485 from the current
study area. However, as shown on the USGS topographic sheet this elevated l~dform actually
extends across the highway to the south. The proposed transmission corridor crosses the lower
southern slopes of the elevated area and in this location a very light surface scatter of lithic
chipping debris, 8-10 small interior flakes, was observed. An oblong quartzite cobble exhibiting
battering on one end and thermal fracturing on one face was also seen. These materials were
widely dispersed and extended from the property fence line adjacent to FM 485 on the north to
the toeslope of the landform on the south, encompassing in that area the 60-foot (18-meter) wide
survey corridor. Three shovel probes were excavated within the survey area that crossed this
rise. The soil profile encountered was a reddish brown, compacted silty clay ranging from 20
to 40 centimeters in depth, underlain by a caliche soil that was clearly sterile. A single complete
tertiary flake made of a yellowish tan chert was recovered from a depth of 28 centimeters below
surface in shovel test #1. The flake is 2.5 centimeters long by 0.5 centimeter wide. It has a
slightly lipped platform. Its maximum thickness is 2.5 millimeters. It appears to be a soft
hammer produced thinning flake.
Also observed on the surface of this hill side were 4-5 fragments of thick brown bottle
glass and 2 fragments of solarized clear glass. These historic materials were also widely
dispersed across the area inspected. No historic material was recovered from the probes.
It is felt that the ephemeral prehistoric materials at this location are associated with the
elevated landform described and therein constitute an extension of previously recorded
41MM214. The historic materials identified would constitute an additional component at the
site. Because of the very low density of the cultural materials (historic and prehistoric), the lack
of buried deposits, and the agriculturally disturbed nature of this portion of the site, no further
work is recommended for the proposed BEPC impact area. This does not negate the
recommendation that was made for testing of the upper portion of the site by previous
investigators. The site limits have been expanded on the appropriate topographic sheet at TARL
and a narrative description of the observations made during this survey has been appended to
the original site form at TARL.

Site 41MM303 was first identified on the basis of cultural materials and ecofacts
recovered from a shovel test (ST#l, Figure 2) excavated within the survey area crossing the
broad expanse of Holocene floodplain on the west side of the Brazos River. The upper 65
centimeters of this shovel test encountered a very compacted reddish brown clay that was

culturally sterile and that was similar to the materials that had been present in other shovel tests
on this lower terrace on both sides of the river. However, beneath 65 centimeters and extending
to at least 114 centimeters below surface, where the shovel test was halted, the probe
encountered a dark black clay loam that was moderately compacted and from which six small
pieces of chert were recovered. Two of these pieces are interior debitage and the remaining four
were produced by thermal fracturing. The largest piece from the two groups is a one
centimeter-square angular fragment of burned and discolored chert. A tiny piece of gray
sandstone was also recovered, possibly representing a fragment of burned rock. From this very
distinct soil stratum three varieties of snail were also recovered.
Two other shovel probes (ST#2 & ST#3, Figure 2) were then dug to attempt to define
the horizontal limits of this buried soil and to recover additional cultural materials. The first of
these probes was dug to the east of a small swale that was observable in the aglicultural field
and is shown on the USGS topographic sheet (Figure 2). The probe encountered only red clay
to a depth of 100 centimeters below surface and yielded no cultural material. It was then
decided to moye back to the west side of the swale and attempt to again encounter the black
clayey loam. The buried soil was encountered in ST#3 but at a depth of 95-100 centimeters
below surface, indicating that the soil was dipping toward the east and the swale. No cultural
material was recovered from ST#3; however, only 5-10 centimeters of the soil was actually
removed from the bottom of the probe.
Based on the results of ST#2 and ST#3, it was felt that a buried paleosol had been
discovered in which at least a limited amount of cultural material was present and that these
deposits were in all likelihood intact because they >were well below the depth of mechanical
disturbance created by normal agricultural practices. Considering the potential archeological
significance of this buried deposit and the limitations of shovel testing for additional evaluation
of the stratum, it was determined that the survey effort should be upgraded to include limited
backhoe trenching, primarily in the locations where the pole structures for the transmission line
were to be emplaced across the lower terrace area. Accordingly, after consultations with BEPC
representatives, this subsurface work was undertaken as a second phase of the site identification
effort.
Five backhoe trenches (BHT #1-5) were dug across the lower terrace on the west side
of the river. BHT's #1, #2, #4, and #5 were dug within the survey corridor immediately
adjacent to the location where poles would be emplaced. None of these four trenches
encountered the paleosol. Backhoe Trench #3 was then dug near the location of ST#l in order
to certainly relocate the stratum. This effort was successful. The exposed portion of the
paleosol within the trench was trowelled and carefully visually inspected for the presence of
cultural materials. Nothing was observed in situ. During the trenching of BHT#3, the paleosol
matrix had been dumped on the opposite side of the trench from the overlying red clay. Fifteen
5-gallon buckets of the black clay were screened through 1\4 inch hardware cloth in an attempt
to recover cultural materials. The total recovery from this effort was two small interior chert
flakes. Three 1-gallon plastic bags of the paleosol were collected and this sample has been
submitted for soil humate assay to GeoChron Laboratory in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in an
17

attempt to establish temporal affiliation for this stratum. The C-13 corrected date for the
paleosol sample is 1,335 ±120 years B. P. (see Apendix B).
In summary, site 41MM303 is contained in a buried, clearly discernible paleosol in a
terrace deposit on the west (right) bank of the Brazos River on the south side of FM 485 in close
proximity to the bridge which crosses the river. Ephemeral aboriginal cultural deposits were
recovered from a relatively minimal effort to investigate this stratum; however, the completed
evaluation was sufficient to determine that the electric poles to be emplaced across this expanse
of terrace will not impact the known limits of the paleosol. Beyond this in terms of horizontal
or vertical extent of this buried horizon little is known. Where identified in the evaluation effort
the contact surface for the paleosol ranges from 65 centimeters to slightly more than 1 meter
below surface. No attempt was made to determine the actual depth of the paleosol in BHT#3
because this was not a subsurface impact area for the BEPC construction project and because
of the potential for further negative impact on the cultural deposits that might be present.
Excavation of BHT#3 did, however, demonstrate that the paleosol is at least 80 centimeters
thick. The known horizontal extent is approximately 30 meters east-west by 10 meters northsouth, encompassing ST#l, ST#3, and BHT#3. It seems that there is a fairly high likelihood
that the buried soil extends farther to the north and south, parallel to both the swale and the
current channel of the river, though this remains to be demonstrated.

The dynamic nature of the depositional and, undoubtedly, erosional processes that have
occurred on this broad expanse of terrace are clearly demonstrated by the widely divergent soils
and profiles (See Appendix A) which were encountered in the various trenches that were
excavated. Based on observations made in the field, it seems possible that the existence of this
paleosol and the presence of an associated cultural site may be related to the low swale (old
channel?) mentioned above. The limited areal extent, if that is the case, may also be related to
the presence of the swale (paleosol truncated by actions of old channel?) and the fact that
immediately to the west of the buried paleosol the topography rises up to an older terrace
formation.
The identification of this paleosol which contains cultural materials and
paleoenvironmental data (snails, soil) is considered to be significant. However, no further
archeological work is recommended for the current BEPC electric utility project because it does
not appear that the project will encroach upon the site area of 41MM303. The known site area
is on private property and because of its buried context should remain intact. Should future land
developments necessitate subsurface disturbance at or in close proximity to this site area, it is
recommended that additional archeological evaluations be undertaken, including
geomorphological studies.
At the western terminus of the proposed transmission line at the tie-in point with existing
electric infrastructure, a solarized (purplish hue) clear bottle neck (hand finished) with a partial
shoulder was recovered from 48 centimeters below surface in a shovel test. This probable late
19th century artifact was broken in 3 pieces, but the 3 fragments were lying exactly against one
another and the break-lines on the opposing faces of the fragments were heavily patinated.

Clearly, the artifact was broken at that location and had lain intact since. Also of interest, this
artifact was contained in a mixed brown clay and tan sand matrix with micro-laminae of brown
clay seemingly indicating some type of subsurface disturbance and subsequent water action. This
mixed soil extended from 29 centimeters to 56 centimeters below surface. Above and below this
zone was very compacted brown clay.
The presence of this historic artifact at depth in an apparently disturbed soil in general
proximity to the previous community of Port Sullivan clearly necessitated additional shovel
testing. Two additional shovel probes were dug, 3 meters and 5 meters from the first. All three
encountered the disturbed soil zone but no other artifacts were recovered. Two other probes dug
along the transmission line right-of-way in the same field did not encounter the mixed soil zone
and failed to yield any type of cultural material. Accordingly, this artifact has been accorded
isolated find status and the nature of the disturbed soil area remains unclear. No additional
cultural resource investigations are recommended for this location.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the above described investigations, cultural resource clearance is recommended
for the construction of the new segment of transmission line as now planned. Archeological
investigations, including pedestrian survey, shovel testing, and backhoe trenching have
determined that the proposed placement of the support poles for the transmission line or
associated surface disturbances will not impact currently known cultural sites.
The identification of a potentially significant cultural and paleoenvironmental resource
in a subsurface context near proposed construction areas clearly indicates that buried
archeological remains might be encountered during construction activities. Should this be the
case, work in those areas should be halted and the Texas Historical Commission Department of
Antiquities Protection should be notified immediately so that a significance evaluation can be
made.

APPENDIX A: BACKHOE TRENCH PROFILE DFSCRIYflONS
Within the proposed transmission line corridor, five backhoe trenches were excavated
across the lower terrace area on the west side of the Brazos River. Profiles and soil descriptions
for four of these trenches (BHT's #1, 2, 3, and 5) are presented below and illustrated in Figure
3. The walls and backdirt pile of BHT#4 were carefully inspected but because of the lack of
cultural material, the homogeneous nature of the exposed profile, and time constraints, no scale
drawing of the wall was done nor were any samples collected for laboratory description.

RADIOCARBON AGE DETERMINATION

REPORT OF ANALYTICAL WORK

Our Sample No. GX-18536

Date Received:

12/10/92

Your Reference: letter of 12/02/92

Date Reported:

10/22/93

Submitted by:

Michael W. Davis
Hicks & Company
1703 West Avenue
Austin, TX 78701

Sample Name: BEPC Millam
humate organic matter
1,335 +/- 120 C-14 years BP

AGE=

Description:

(C-13 corrected).

Sample of soil to be analyzed as a humate fraction

Pretreatment: The entire sample was dispersed in a large volume of
water and the clays and organic matter were eluted away from
any sand and silt by sedimentation and decantation. The
clay/organic fraction was then treated with hot dilute HCl to
remove any carbonates. It was then filtered, washed, dried,
and roasted in oxygen to recover carbon dioxide from the
organic matter for the analysis.

Comment:

Notes: This date Is based upon the Libby half life (5570 years) for 14 C. The error stated Is ::t:1a as judged
by the analytical data alone. Our modem standard Is 95% of the activity of N.B.S. Oxalic Acid.

The age is referenced to the year A.O. 1950.
