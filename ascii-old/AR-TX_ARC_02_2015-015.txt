ABSTRACT
The City of Rockwall is proposing to construct the 14.4-acre Stone Creek
Park on the northwest corner of John King Boulevard and Featherstone
Drive in Rockwall, Texas. AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) was contracted to
survey the route and conducted the survey March 6, 2015. No prehistoric
or historic archaeological sites were found during the survey. This follows
the predictions made prior to field work which were based on the project
area’s location in the upper reaches of the Thompson Branch Watershed.
Given the results of this survey, AR Consultants, Inc. recommends that
further cultural resource investigations are unnecessary for this project,
and requests that the Texas Historical Commission concur with this
recommendation.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Rockwall is proposing to construct the 14.4-acre Stone Creek Park in Rockwall
County, Texas. Most of the park consists of a 11.5-acre rectangle bounded by Featherstone Drive
on the south, John King Boulevard on the east, and J. W. Williams Middle School property on
the north. An additional 2.9 acres north follow the intermittent Thompson Branch to the north
and will be incorporated into the park (Figure 1). An existing one-acre pond in the southeast
corner of the property will also be part of the park.
AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) was contracted to conduct a cultural resource survey, which
included archival research, to determine the prehistoric and historic archaeological presence in
the proposed park property. In the scope of work dated February 27, 2015, ARC recommended
that entire property be intensively surveyed and systematically shovel tested. The Texas
Historical Commission agreed with this survey strategy. The cultural resource survey was
conducted on March 6, 2015.
The cultural resource investigation was required because the City of Rockwall is a State entity
and Texas Antiquities Permit Number 7199 was issued for the archaeological survey. Relevant
legislation includes the Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas Natural Resource Code, Title 9,
Chapter 191). The Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission will review this
report on behalf of the State.
This report is written in accordance with report guidelines adopted by the Archeology Division
of the Texas Historical Commission, and developed by the Council of Texas Archeologists
(n.d.). The following report presents a brief description of the natural setting of the project area,
followed by a discussion of the culture history and previous investigations in the region
surrounding the study area. A chapter on the research design and methodology employed in the
investigation is then followed by the results of the field investigation. The report concludes with
recommendations followed by the references cited.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The project area is in the Northern Blackland Prairie Ecoregion of Texas (Griffith et al. 2007).
The Blackland Prairie was once an expanse of rolling tallgrass prairie. This region features low,
stair-step hills and plains (Bureau of Economic Geology 1996). The park property is situated in
the upper reaches of the Thompson Branch Watershed near the divide between Squabble Creek
and Thompson Branch.
The geology of the project area is anchored by the Upper Cretaceous-aged Marlbrook Marl
(Bureau of Economic Geology 1988). This formation consists mostly of calcareous clay with
some silt and glauconite. Most of park is mapped as Houston Black clay with 1- to 5-percent
slopes and Heiden clay with 3- to 5-percent slopes (Pringle 1977:Sheets 2-3). The narrow strip
containing the drainage is mapped as Altoga silty clay with 3- to 12-percent slopes. Houston
Black clay has a 60-inch-thick A horizon of very dark gray clay above the dark gray clay AC
horizon. Like the Houston Black series, the Heiden series is an upland soil and has a 27-in-thick
A horizon above an olive clay AC horizon. The Altoga soil forms on old, high terraces. This
series has a 5-in-thick A horizon of grayish-brown silty clay above the light yellowish-brown
silty clay B horizon.

CULTURE HISTORY
The history and prehistory of North Central Texas is summarized in several reports prepared by
the University of North Texas (Lebo and Brown 1990; Brown and Lebo 1991; Ferring and Yates
1998). The most commonly used chronology for the region was established by Prikryl (1990)
which divides the Late Prehistoric, the time from the use of the bow and pottery to the Historic
Native American, into two periods: Late Prehistoric I (A.D. 700 to 1200) and Late Prehistoric II
(A.D. 1200 to 1600).

2,000 B.C. to A.D. 700
4,000 B.C. to 2,000 B.C.
6,000 B.C. to 4,000 B.C.
ca. 11,000 B.C. to 6,000 B.C.

Prehistoric Native American settlement in North Central Texas began at least 10,000 years ago
as attested to by the presence of distinctively shaped dart points (Crook and Harris 1957) at the
Lewisville site and the Aubrey Clovis site (Ferring 2001) in Denton County to the west.
Moreover, artifact collectors report the presence of Clovis, Folsom, Scottsbluff, and other PaleoIndian points from the surface of sites in the region. Though no Clovis points have been reported
from Rockwall County, six, three, and one have been found in adjacent Dallas Hunt, and
Kaufman counties, respectively (Bever and Meltzer 2007). The presence of exotic, non-local
lithic resources indicates that these early people traveled to territory where higher quality lithics
were available, or were involved in a system of raw material trading. These early people hunted
now extinct large game, but probably also foraged off the land.
The Archaic period (6,000 B.C.-A.D. 700) is characterized by increased alluviation of water
channels and a generally wetter environment than the previous period. This change in climate
resulted in modification of Native American subsistence patterns, with broad exploitation of
bottomland food resources. This, in turn, resulted in clusters of seasonal settlements along large
drainages, including the Trinity River and its various forks and tributaries, and a marked increase
in population density. With the advent of repeated, seasonal occupation of sites along drainages
came a perceived increase in territorial constrictions among different groups in the region, with
several authors citing the limited use of regional lithic resources as evidence of this trend
(Skinner 1981; Prewitt 1983). The earliest Archaic peoples continued using exotic cherts for dart
points, but, as time passed, there was a subtle shift toward the use of locally available stone,
specifically Uvalde Gravels, for chipped stone tools (Menzer and Slaughter 1971; Prikryl 1990:
47-65).
During Late Prehistoric I, a small amount of pottery appears at the Baggett Branch site,
41DL149 (Prikryl and Perttula 1995:189). From A.D. 1000 to 1300, pottery appears in North
Central Texas that has similarities to Caddo pottery. This similarity is not well understood, and

may be the result of trade with Caddo to the east, adoption of Caddo ceramic manufacture,
Caddo settlement in North Central Texas, or some combination of these scenarios (Prikryl and
Perttula 1995:189-190). Arrowheads appear about this same time, signaling the bow and arrow’s
introduction to the hunting toolkit. Additionally, houses were found at the Cobb-Pool site,
41DL148 (Peter and McGregor 1988:140). Fritz (1993) mentions the use of corn for food in
North Central Texas during this time and Todd (1999) suggests that the presence of mussel shell
hoes in North Central Texas indicates some form of farming.
Stephenson (1952:305-312) tried to create a chronological sequence for the Upper Trinity River
Basin when he defined the Late Prehistoric Wylie Focus, which was dated to A.D. 1300 to 1600,
based on shell and clay-grit tempered pottery which, he believed, was Caddo in origin. The
Wylie Focus was characterized by large circular pits, no indigenous pottery, flexed burials (both
single and multiple and in poorly defined burial pits), maize agriculture and villages. The Wylie
Focus term was discarded when Bruseth and Martin (1987:280) dated pits at the Bird Point
Island and the Adams Ranch sites to the Late Archaic period.
It has been suggested that the climate was drier during the Late Prehistoric II. Bison may have
been utilized more than in Late Prehistoric I times. The presence of bison-scapula hoes,
especially in northern North Central Texas, suggests an increase in horticulture or, at least, its
first appearance. This concept is supported by the presence of sites along sandy terraces instead
of the floodplain area where Late Prehistoric I sites are found. Also, there is a marked Plains
influence on lithic tool assemblages found in North Central Texas dating to this period (Prikryl
1990:80).
At the end of the Late Prehistoric periods, there appears to have been a general abandonment of
the North Central Texas area (Skinner 1988). Along the Red River in Montague and Cooke
Counties and across the Red River in Oklahoma, there is both archaeological and ethnographic
evidence of historic Taovaya, Wichita, and Yscani Indians (Bell et al. 1967; John 1992:204).
Since the Spanish could not subdue these tribes, they made them their allies with promises of
help against the Osages.
European occupation of area began with Spanish and French expeditions, and establishment of
trading settlements along the Red River in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries (Kumler 2015). Early
settlement of the region began in the 1840s when the Republic of Texas actively promoted the
migration of settlers by offering its most abundant asset: land (Staumbaugh and Staumbaugh
1958; Northcutt 1998). Large tracts of undeveloped land were given to impresarios, who in turn,
promised to bring in a specified number of families into Texas. One of the first and largest
undertakings was that of W. S. Peters and his associates, known as the Texas Emigration and
Land Company, who formed the Peters Colony. Promoters of the Peters Colony recruited
primarily non-Texan families, many of whom came from the Upland South of the United States.
Texas was annexed by the United States in 1846 the area that is now Rockwall County was part
of Henderson County and then Kaufman County in 1847 (Bass 2015). Finally, in 1873, Rockwall
County was formed. Around the same time, the construction of the railroad through Rockwall
caused a major shift in the region’s economy toward agriculture, specifically cotton. Another

major shift has been taking place over the last 50 years as the county has been absorbed into the
greater Dallas metropolitan area, consequently becoming less rural.
Previous Investigations
A review of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA 2015) shows that there are no
previously recorded archaeological sites, cultural resource surveys, historical markers,
cemeteries, or National Register Properties within the proposed park property. One site, 41RW27
is located a half a mile southwest of the current survey area. This site was recorded in 2013 by
Integrated Environmental Solutions, LLC and consists of a low-density scatter of historic
artifacts and five structures. The site dates to the mid-20th century and was recommended not
eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places.
The largest archaeological survey in Rockwall County was conducted at Lake Ray Hubbard
(formerly Forney Reservoir) by the Dallas Archeological Society (DAS) (Harris and Suhm
1963). Thirty-three archaeological sites were recorded. This survey described 20 sites already
known to the Dallas Archeological Society membership (Hannah 1941; Hannah and Harris 1948;
Harris 1948, 1960), and located 13 previously unrecorded sites. Limited excavations were
subsequently conducted at the Lower Rockwall site (Lorrain and Hoffrichter 1968) and the
Upper Rockwall site (Ross 1966). These excavations provided evidence of the way of life
practiced by the prehistoric peoples who occupied this part of the East Fork valley. Recent work
conducted by ARC at 41RW2 (the Upper Rockwall site) recovered the remains of at least six
Native Americans along with animal bones and lithic artifacts.
ARC has conducted several cultural resource surveys in Rockwall County, all of which found no
sites, features, or artifacts. In 1999, ARC surveyed a 30-acre area for three parks approximately
nine miles south of the current project area for the City of Heath (Skinner 1999). ARC also
surveyed approximately 15,000 feet of sewer pipeline route adjacent to Sabine Creek for Royse
City but failed to discover any archaeological sites on the ground surface or in 48 shovel tests
(Todd 2004). The East Fork Water Reuse pipeline route, which runs north/south across Rockwall
County west of the study area, and the Lake Tawakoni Water Supply pipeline, which terminates
in southeastern Rockwall County, were surveyed by ARC (Todd 2006; Todd and Skinner 2005).
Four historic maps dating from 1923 to 1968 were reviewed prior to the survey (TSHD 1936,
1954; USDA 1923; USGS 1963). One structure is mapped near the east side of the project area
on the 1923 and 1936 maps, but it does not appear on later maps. This structure should be
located under or on the east side of John King Boulevard, but it is possible some evidence of it
could be in the proposed park property. No other structures or features were mapped within the
park property. Additionally, no structures are visible in the project area on recent aerial photos.

RESEARCH DESIGN & METHODOLOGY
Research Design
Based on the research conducted prior to the survey, two hypotheses were developed. First, it
was hypothesized that it is unlikely to encounter prehistoric archaeological sites within the park
property. This is because the property is in the upper reaches of the watershed, where access to
water is unreliable and inconsistent. This lack of water means there were few food resources in
the property. Additionally, there are no known tool stone sources in the area.
The second hypothesis states that there was low potential for encountering historic sites in the
project area. There are no structures or features shown in the project area on the historic maps.
However, historic trash scatters may be located in the drainages or where the route crosses
historic roads.
Methodology
Survey was conducted in accordance with the standards set forth by the THC (n.d.). Field
personnel walked the entire property in transects no more than 30 m apart. Six shovel tests were
placed within the 14.5-acre property where ground visibility was below 30 percent and where
slopes were less than 20 percent. Shovel tests averaged 30 cm in diameter. The clay fill was
inspected visually and broken into smaller chunks in order to determine if cultural materials were
present. Shovel test matrices were described on the basis of composition, texture, and color. The
Munsell Soil Color Chart (2009) was used to identify soil colors. Field personnel made notes
about the ground exposure, drainages, soil types, and disturbed areas where subsoil was exposed.
Photographs were taken during the survey using a GPS-equipped digital camera. Shovel test and
project boundary locations were marked with a handheld GPS receiver.

RESULTS
This chapter is divided into two sections. The first describes the project area’s natural setting
along with results of the pedestrian survey. Conclusions derived from the survey close the
chapter. Shovel tests are described generally throughout the text and are detailed in Table 1 at the
end of the Survey Results section.
Survey Results
The southwest portion of the project area is a plowed field that was recently scraped by a
developer, leaving 100-percent ground visibility at the time of survey (Figure 2 and Figure 3).
The rest of the property was covered in one- to three-foot-tall grasses with scattered trees (Figure
4 and Figure 5). Bois d’arc, oak, and juniper trees were concentrated along the creek, the pond
edge, and fence lines. The north half of the western portion was terraced when it was being
farmed. Part of the property located along John King Boulevard and just north of shovel test
(ST) 05, has been built up to create a level surface 3-6 feet above the natural surface (Figure 3
and Figure 6). No shovel tests were excavated on this raised portion. The narrow stream
floodplain is covered with short grasses and a few scattered trees (Figure 7).

Six shovel tests were excavated in the property where ground visibility was less than 30 percent
and slopes were less than 20 percent (Figure 3). Four shovel tests (ST01-04) were terminated at
25-60 cm below the surface (cmbs) due to water. All four of these STs revealed very dark gray
clay. ST01 exposed the addition of calcium carbonate at 40 cmbs. ST05 revealed a top layer of
very dark gray clay underlain by dark gray clay with a middle layer where the two sediments are
mottled. No color or texture change was noted in ST06, which was excavated to 80cmbs. No
artifacts, features, or structures were found in the shovel tests or on the surface of the property.

Conclusions
No archaeological sites, features, or artifacts were identified during the survey. This was
expected for prehistoric sites, due to the lack of reliable water sources and other necessary
natural resources. This result was also expected for most of the project area regarding historic
sites. The only location that might have had evidence of historic occupation was the southeast
corner. No evidence was found and it is likely the structure mapped nearby on historic maps was
actually located where John King Boulevard is.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The purpose of this investigation was to determine if significant cultural resources are present in
the proposed Stone Creek Park property in Rockwall County, Texas. No archaeological sites
were recorded. ARC concludes that further cultural resource investigations are unwarranted
within the proposed project area and recommends that the Texas Historical Commission concur
with this assessment. However, if buried cultural materials are discovered during construction,
the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission should be notified.
