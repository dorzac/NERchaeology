MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT
Last month’s Archeological Awareness fairs
were well attended by many members of
the Tarrant County Archeological Society.
Every weekend for the entire mouth of October many of our people helped out at
fairs held at Kaufmann County, Plano,
Gainesville, and Denton. Thanks to Jim
and Peggy Blanton, John and Laurel Wilson, Glynn and Sandy Osburn, Brett and
Linda Lang, Nita Thurman, Paula Vastine, Marvin Glasgow, Mark
Cohen, Ona B Reed and Mickey Miller for volunteering to help
make sure these events were very successful. We only had bad
weather during the Plano fair, but typical October weather helped
provide good public attendance for the other fairs. Everyone had a
great time.
As I am writing this article I am also packing for the TAS
Annual Meeting in San Antonio. The excitement and anticipation
for this TAS yearly meeting is just as high for me as the TAS Field
School is in June. Getting to see some longtime friends that have
been made over the years as a member of the Texas Archeological
Society is undoubtedly the one of the biggest rewards. However,
over the past four or five years it seems like the quantity and quality of presentations and programs at the Annual Meeting just
keeps getting better every year. I expect that our Tarrant County
Archeological Society will be well represented there too. If you are
not going to be able to attend the TAS Annual Meeting this year you
are missing out on a wonderful event. I hope you will have the opportunity to go next year.

OCTOBER PROGRAM

MAX RATHEAL
“The Comanches and U.S. Cavalry, as of
September 28, 1874”
I am a 64 year old retired (after 31 years) Professor of Chemistry. I
spent my entire career at Weatherford College. I also operated the
only college affiliated drug lab in the state of Texas, doing marijuana analysis for the local police departments. I had some prior
experience with law enforcement, as my father was Sheriff of
Crosby County back in the early 60’s. We lived in the apartment
below the jail! Stories abound here!
I’m a member of the Tarrant County Archaeology Society, the Parker County Archaeological Society, Texas Archaeological Society, the Fort Worth Corral of Westerners International (Sheriff), and the Weatherford Business and Professional Men’s
Club
I’ve been married to my wife, Gay, for 40 years. We have three grown children that
have blessed us with seven granddaughters (from 15 to 3 years old). Don’t think
my house isn’t a melee at Christmas time?
Maybe it’s a secret only to me but Max is also somewhat of a local celebrity appearing in commercials, industrial presentations, and live theatre. That’s his “head shot”
above. Ed

My presentation will be a discussion of little known facts about the Comanche,
their culture and origins. Also the U. S. Cavalry, their culture and origins. These
topics include the fascinating things I ran across in the research for my book,
“The Wrinkled Hand Chase,” a novel of historical fiction. I’ll explain the title of
the book. I have copies of the book on hand if anyone is interested.

NAME THAT POINT

“THE HARRELL POINT CONTROVERSY”
The September “Name That Point” started out harmlessly
enough; A smallish, triangular point with deep notches and a
concave base identified as a Harrell Point.
Then came the E-mails.
“Doesn’t look like a Harrell to me,” wrote one of our members.
“The point you have listed is an Edwards Point, not a Harrell,”
wrote another.
Now I’m confused! In desperation I turned to the ultimate
source of information: the INTERNET.
Google-ing “Harrell Point” gave me results like: “Harrell’s point
of view,” an article about a mathematical physicist (I think); “Comments on Harrell’s
‘Marx and Critical Thought’”; and “25 Women ‘WoW’ San Francisco,” about point

Losing land in texas
Archaeologists fear the worst for historic site
By Isadora Vail

AMERICAN-STATESMAN STAFF

Michael Collins, an archaeological researcher at the
University of Texas, has spent the past 16 years
studying artifacts from a patch of Williamson County
to uncover a prehistoric society that camped there
nearly 11,000 years ago.
"I put seven years of mind-numbing and back-breaking
effort into this," Collins said as he thumbed through a
five-volume, 1,400-page report that he and 30 other
experts wrote. "This was not easy."

But the conservancy and archaeologists said excavations are costly and extensive endeavors, done only
when a site is in danger.
"When you dig up a site, you destroy it, so we try to save
it for a time when there is better technology and better
understanding," conservancy President Mark Michel
said. "Funding is always a problem, but this preserve
has had more research done on it than most. This is one
of the most important sites in North America."

Archaeologists said that preserving the land is the best
option and criticized District Judge Burt Carnes for sidA major road now covers the site, but Collins thinks land ing with the Wilson family after the Archaeological Connearby has similar finds. He may never get to find out.

nite resource."

While work was being done on an extension of RM
1431, an ancient burial site was found in 1982. It contained thousands of artifacts and the remains of a prehistoric woman that dated back about 11,000 years,
Collins said.

The discovery changed researchers' ideas about how
tribes lived and moved through the area and how they
gathered food, he said. The sedimentary bed where the
remains and artifacts were found continues through the
disputed land, and archaeologists are sure that there is
more to discover.
The Wilson family donated the land in 1991 so researchers could study it but took the property back last
year, saying it wasn't being used in the way the family
wanted.
Will Wilson Jr.'s father wanted the Archaeological Conservancy — a nonprofit group from New Mexico with
hundreds of preserves nationwide — to excavate the
land, share it with educational institutions and rename
it in memory of his late wife.
"We wanted them to do something with the site, but
they did nothing," Will Wilson Jr. said.

Britt Bousman directs the Center for Archaeological
Studies at Texas State University-San Marcos and
worked on the Wilson-Leonard site. He said the case
stems from an early misunderstanding between the
family and the conservancy.
"I think the conservancy was doing what needed to be
done. Continuous research on a site like this is incredible because it is extremely costly and time-consuming,"
Bousman said. "I just wish both sides could have come
to some agreement before this legal mess."
The conservancy plans to appeal Carnes' decision,
which could take years to complete. Collins fears that
the family will sell the land to developers, but Will Wilson Jr. said he would like to bury the hatchet.
"It's an important site, and we have always respected
the history it holds. The main influence for this is that
we are disappointed that they did not carry out their
deal," he said. We "aren't making any promises with
what the land will go to, but I think it could go to the
state."

FOR THOSE OF US WHO DIDN’T GET TO ATTEND THE TAS ANNUAL MEETING

MAIN PLAZA FINDS DISCUSSED AT
MEETING OF ARCHAEOLOGISTS
Cindy Tumiel Express-News

Archaeologists who investigated an old trench uncovered during San Antonio's Main Plaza renovations
found bits of ammunition, sword tips and other artifacts that tell the story of Mexican soldiers who dug in
there to protect themselves from Texian rebels during an 1835 siege that preceded the battle of the
Alamo.
A short distance away, beside the Bexar County Courthouse, the
archaeologists from PBS&J of Austin found discarded animal
bones, broken pottery, cooking utensils and other items in what
was a trash pit used by both Native Americans and Spanish colonial settlers between the mid-1700s and early 20th century.
The archaeological dig in the heart of downtown was among the
topics Saturday at the annual meeting of the Texas Archeological
Society at the Menger Hotel.
The discoveries were not astonishing, but they add context to a
fabled event in the history of the state, said Nesta Anderson, one
of the project archaeologists.
"This tells us a little about the Mexican soldiers. Here are people in
Main Plaza trying to defend themselves," Anderson said.
Artifacts are now being studied at the University of Texas Center
for Archaeological Research and someday may go on public display, said Eugene Foster Jr., a senior scientist at PBS&J.
"What the city is doing here and the attention being paid to these
findings is one of the benefits that come from the project," Foster
said. "The plaza gets a facelift and the public gets access and
knowledge about some of these past events."

Archeologists stand near the construction site
where artifacts dating back to the Battle of the
Alamo were found at Main Plaza in San Antonio.

The forgotten caliche-lined trench, later filled with dirt and trash,
was uncovered on the southeast corner of the plaza by contractors
who dug up the street as part of the $10 million drainage and
renovation project.

Historians believe Mexican troops under the command of Gen.
Martín Perfecto de Cos hastily dug trenches around the perimeter
of Main Plaza 172 years ago as Texians launched the first major campaign of the Texas Revolution. Cos surrendered Dec. 9, 1835, according to historical accounts. Three months later, Gen. Antonio López de Santa Anna began the 13-day siege on the Alamo on Feb. 23, 1836.
The refuse uncovered near the present-day courthouse suggest the area likely was a dumping ground for both Native Americans and Spanish settlers for more than 150 years, Anderson said.

DECEMBER EVENTS

GIS FOR ARCHAEOLOGY
DEC. 1 &2 / Baylor Sciences building
This workshop adopts an approach that is both practical and rigorous because most archaeologists are
interested in a selective set of geospatial tools, but poorly described short cuts often bring questionable
results by the user. The course condenses all the most important GIS concepts and operations that are
commonly utilized by the archaeological community into a series of short lectures followed by relevant
hands-on examples using ArcGIS software and extensions.
This workshop intends to:
1. Rapidly achieve the “critical mass” of GIS concepts and practice
for archaeologists to effectively learn GIS on their own in the future.
2. Learn appropriate applications and limitations of GIS techniques
to solve archaeological problems.
3. Build knowledge in the discipline by immersing the student in
practical applications and instrumentation while being supported by
comprehensive theoretical training.
Participants will receive a workbook with related articles, example exercises, activity instructions, and lecture slides.

NAME THAT POINT (CONTINUED)
So I turn my Google-ing to “Edwards Point.” Since the Internet is not quite exact, yet, I get results for “Point Edwards” of
Edmond, Washington; “Edwards Point Beach Villas” somewhere in Australia; and “Edwards Point Trails” at Signal Mountain (of course, Google-ing “Signal Mountain returns results from Vermont to Tennessee to the Tetons).
I actually found a good deal about both point types on the net. The Harrell Point was named for the Harrell Site by Alex
Krieger in 1954; the Edwards Point named after the Edwards Plateau where much of the native chert comes from. My
hunch is that Harrell points were Edwards points before 1954, though it’s only a hunch. The only descriptive difference
I can find is that Edwards points might be slightly larger than Harrells but that’s hard to see one point at a time. And,
maybe, the Harrell is a little more “angular” at the shoulders and base notching. But, as I said, I’m confused.
I keep thinking back to a remark made to me this past Field School by Elton Prewitt who has seen a few more points
than I have. It was something like, “After seeing tens of thousands of lithics, I’m still hesitant to name any of them.”
Below are several Edwards and Harrell points that might be fun to sort out.
