ARCHEOLOGICAL RECONNAISSANCE OF A PROPOSED SUBSTATION SITE
Gonzales County, Texas

Principal Investigator

A letter report submitted to the Lower Colorado River Authority
in fulfillment of the terms of a Purchase Order dated August
13, 1980. This project was performed under the authority
granted by State Antiquities Permit No. 252.

INTRODUCTION

At the request of the Lower Colorado River Authority,
David S. Dibble of the Texas Archeological Survey conducted
an archeological survey of a parcel of land located on the
outskirts of the city of Gonzales, Texas. The exact location
of the property is noted on the attached maps. The purpose
of the reconnaissance and the auxillary historical research was
to identify the presence of cultural resources effecting
plans for land modification. No such remains were located.
The following paragraphs detail, for record purposes, the
results of both the historical research and the on-site
examination of the property.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
The general area of the property was located on the 29th
of June, 1980, although the road network shown on the 1962
U.S.G.S. map was overgrown and the vegetation somewhat
different than noted. The area is now scattered scrub mesquite
which slopes gently to the northwest.
Some spotty surface exposures of rounded to subrounded
gravels, including chert, were noted, but aboriginal exploitation
of these lithic materials was not evident. A small drainway
cuts diagonally across the property at the northwest corner;
the channel is not currently well-developed although pools
exist. It is possible that alluvium deposited by floods along
this drainage have buried aboriginal sites and that no surface
indications of these buried sites exist. A full scale survey
with some subsurface testing would be required to clear the area
for construction. Core holes were noted near several survey
stakes on the property; no evidence of subsurface cultural remains
was noted in these areas.

HISTORICAL STRUCTURES
The only visible structure on the property is a small
pen enclosure in a low area near the creek. The structure
appears to be of recent origin, but is near a mature grove
of pecan trees. A fragment of cut pink granite was noted
nearby. We do not believe that these items, or the scattered
scraps of strap iron, wood, brick and other construction
material near the enclosure, are of any historical significance.
A preliminary examination of the land ownership within
the "outer town" survey of the four league Gonzales town grant
shows that the property in question was not privately owned at
the time of the greatest historical significance. Map 1 is a
plan of this portion of the Mexican colonial town of Gonzales
which was burned before being evacuated by the rebelling
colonists. The land just west of the proposed tract was
owned by Almeron Dickenson, the Gonzales blacksmith who
commanded the artillery under Colonel Travis at the Alamo.
Dickenson died at the Alamo, but his widow, young daughter
and servants were spared. The Dickensonls apparently had a
home in the inner town. The location of the battle of Gonzales
which served to open hostilities in the Texas Revolution is
also noted on the sketch map.
Stars on the map are used to denote parcels of land that may
have had early dwellings; these are grants where the owner did
not have lots or other property in the inner town as well.
The Nancy Maiden grant (block 8 of Range 2) is close to the
proposed site but does not present a problem.
Map 2 is a portion of the current U.S.G.S. 7.5 0 Quadrangle
map of the area. The proposed project area is indicated as
a hatched square. Water Street appears on both Maps 1 and 2
and is the western boundary of the inner town survey on the
original town plat. St. Andrew Street marks the northern

border of the inner town on the original plat map and is
clearly labeled in the lower right portion of Map 2.
The complete list of lots in the inner town and those
in the outer town west of Water Street as compiled by
Rather (1904:168-171) is attached as an appendix. It should
be noted that the Block, Range, and lot numbers for the outer
town can be checked against Map 1, but the map does not cover
the entire plat. The scale of Map 1 precludes location of
inner town lots on it. These lists show only those grants
made by the aZaades of Gonzales up to the Fall of 1835.
Subsequent grants made by the mayors of Gonzales under the
Republic are not shown.
CONCLUSIONS
In our opinion the purchase of the site in question by
LCRA for the construction of an electrical substation would
be quite feasible and would not adversely effect any cultural
resources. An intensive survey with subsurface testing for
buried sites and careful monitoring of excavations required
in construction would be required to preclude damage to
undetected buried sites. However, we found no surface
indication that such sites are present.
