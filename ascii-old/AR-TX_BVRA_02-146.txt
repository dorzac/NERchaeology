ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of 13 locations pre-selected by AR Consultants,
Inc. associated with a proposed water line in northern Runnels County and
southern Taylor County was conducted by Brazos Valley Research Associates
(BVRA) in February of 2005 for the North Runnels Water Supply Corporation
(WSC) under Antiquities Permit 3666. In all, 12.7 acres were examined. No
previously recorded sites were found to be within any of the 13 areas. This survey
located three lithic procurement sites (41RN234 – 41RN236) where chert cobbles
were tested for use in tool manufacture. The survey only examined portions of the
three sites; therefore, the eligibility of these sites has not been assessed. The
portions investigated are on deflated surfaces and contain no temporally diagnostic
artifacts. Therefore, these areas are viewed by BVRA as not significant and worthy
of additional work. It is recommended that construction be allowed to proceed by
North Runnels WSC without further consultation from the Texas Historical
Commission (THC).

INTRODUCTION
The North Runnels WSC is applying for funds from the United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA), Rural Utilities Services (RUS) to improve it’s
water distribution system by extending service to 169 new meters as well as
alleviate pressure and supply problems throughout the system in northern Runnels
and southern Taylor counties (Figure 1). Topographic coverage of the project area
is provided by seven USGS 7.5’ maps. These are Bradshaw, Hatchel, Herring
Ranch, Novice West, Shep, Tuscola, and Wilmeth. The 13 areas examined are
depicted on these topographic maps in figures 2-9.
Most of the “proposed additions” will be routed along state highways, county
roads, and farm-to-market roads. Proposed water line additions will be centered in
a 20-foot wide permanent easement adjacent to the various road rights-of-way,
which they parallel. The proposed additions will include approximately 61.5 miles
of water line consisting of 3.8 miles of 6” PVC water line, 1.8 miles of 4” PVC water
line, 8.3 miles of 3” PVC water line, and 47.7 miles of 2” PVC water line. Other
items will include pressure regulators, meters, valves and necessary fittings, as well
as steel encasement for several highway crossings. The permanent easement for
the water line is 20 feet. Pipe will be placed in a trench two feet wide and four feet
deep.
An archaeological survey was requested in a letter from William A. Martin of
the THC to Kelly Rosenbaum of the engineering firm Jacob and Martin, Ltd. dated
May 18, 2004. In July of 2004, AR Consultants, Inc. conducted an “archaeological
evaluation” of the project area and recommended 13 areas for survey (Trask 2004).
The THC concurred, and BVRA was hired to perform this service.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Runnels and Taylor counties are located in west-central Texas. The
following discussions were taken from the published soil surveys for Runnels
County (Conner 1976) and Taylor County (Wiedenfeld et al. 1970).
Runnels County
Most of Runnels County consists of nearly level to gently sloping terrain.
There are a few very steep limestone hills in the northeastern part, but about 40%
of the county has slopes of less than 1 foot fall in 100 feet. This nearly level land is
the best farmland in the county, and most of it is in cultivation. About 33% of the
county has slopes of 1-3 foot fall in 100 feet. These areas are suitable for
cultivation, but erosion control is needed. The remaining 27% of the county is too
steep, too shallow, or too sandy to be suitable for crops. On about 71% of the total
acreage in this county, the soils developed in plains outwash or very old alluvium;
on 17% they developed in limestone; on 7% they developed in recent stream
alluvium; and 5% developed in red marine clay, sandstone, or conglomerate, or in a
mixture of these materials. On about 65% of the acreage, the soils are more than
20 inches deep; on 19% they are between 10 and 20 inches deep; and on 16%
they are less than 10 inches deep. On about 81% of the acreage, the surface layer
is loamy; on about 18% it is clay or silty clay; and on 1% it is sandy. On about 86%
of the acreage, the soils are calcareous throughout.
Taylor County
About 75% of the acreage of Taylor County lies in the Central Rolling Red
Plains Resource Area, and about 25% is in the Edwards Plateau Resource Area.
The Central Rolling Red Plains area consists of smooth plains that are dissected by
numerous streams and creeks. Soils in this area formed in outwash sediment and
Permian sandstone, clay, and shale. The streams and creeks have narrow, alluvial
soils that were deposited by water.
The most conspicuous feature of the surface terrain in the area is the
Edwards Plateau, which rises 200 to 700 feet above the general level of the Central
Rolling Red Plains. The plateau extends from east to west across the central part
of Taylor County and is outlined in most areas by steep escarpments. The
Edwards Plateau also serves as a divide between the Clear Fork of the Brazos
River and the Colorado River. Plateau soils are mostly shallow or moderately deep
over limestone or marl.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
The project area is located in a region referred to by Biesaart et al. (1985)
as the Lower Plains cultural geographical region, by Powell and Creel (1989) as
part of the North Central Texas archeological region, and by Brown et al. (1982)
as on the border between the two. According to Krieger (1946), the cultural
patterns in this region tend to mirror those found to the east more than those
identified farther west in the high plains of the Llano Estacado. Since no defined
culture sequence has been established for the Lower Plains cultural unit,
researchers are forced to borrow the sequences defined in nearby regions such
as Central Texas or North Central Texas.
Cultural chronologies for the North Central Texas area have been
presented by Brown (1987), Krieger (1946), Prikryl (1987), and Skinner and
Gallagher (1974). Chronologies for Central Texas have been prepared by
Prewitt (1981, 1985) and Carlson et al. (1986).
Although there is some
difference in the terminology used by these researchers, they all agree that the
last 10,000 to 12,000 years of prehistory and history for the area can be divided
into four major temporal periods. These are Paleo-Indian (12,000 B.P. to 8000
B.P.); Archaic (8000 B.P. to 1250 B.P.); Late Prehistoric (1250 B.P. to 300 B.P.);
and Historic (300 B.P. to Present).
Even though few sites in the two counties have been subjected to more
than survey level investigation, it is apparent that the area was occupied from
circa 11,500 B.P. through the Historic Indian and Anglo-American periods
(Powell and Creel 1989:10). Possibly the oldest remains in the area have been
found at the Gibson site (41TA1) in Taylor County. This is a deeply stratified site
along Elm Creek containing artifacts dating to the Paleo-Indian period (Leighton
1936; Ray 1940, 1941, 1945; Sayles 1935). Another early site is McLean
(41TA29), a stratified site with archaeological remains dating from Paleo-Indian
through the Historic period (Bryan and Ray 1938; Ray 1930, 1935).
The majority of known prehistoric sites in the area date to the Archaic
period. They usually consist of burned rock middens, hearths, or lithic scatters
near intermittent and permanent streams. In some cases, sites have been found
beneath alluvial sediments that underlie the modern surface. Other sites in the
area are lithic workshops, quarry sites, and isolated burials in rock crevices or
beneath cairns.
Powell and Creel (1989:10) state that comparatively “few sites with
Historic Indian remains are recorded in the region, although many might exist.” It
is their opinion that most of the known Historic Indian sites are individual burials
probable attributable to Apache, Comanche, or Kiowa Indians. Two known
Historic Indian sites in the area are 41TA29 (iron arrow point) (Sayles 1935) and
41TA111 where a burial was found in a rock crevice with glass beads (Sayles
1935).

12

A review of Sayles’ Texas survey revealed the presence of additional
burials in the area. These are remains beneath a stone covered pit at 41TA32, a
possible carin burial at 41TA45, and burials in campsites at 41TA61, 41TA80,
and 41TA81.
The Historic period is represented by a wide variety of sites. Fort
Phantom Hill was established in 1851 about 15 miles north of present-day
Abilene to protect the advancing American frontier. In 1858, the ruins of the
abandoned fort were used as a way station on the Butterfield Trail Overland Mail
Route (Richardson et al. 1988:169; Conkling and Conkling 1947). This trail
extended southwest from Fort Phantom Hill about two miles northwest of what is
now Dyess Air Force Base. Fort Griffin was established in 1867 to the northeast
of Abilene and was active during the Indian Wars of 1871 to 1874 (Rister 1969).
Anglo-American settlement in the Abilene area was not well established until the
late 1870s (Fox 1983). With the beginning of permanent settlement, towns were
created and the Indians were forced to move. Many historic sites in rural areas
are reminders of ranching activities in an area where cattle was the major
industry.

METHODS
Background Check
Prior to entering the field, the site records at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) on the campus of The University of Texas at Austin
were checked for the presence of previously recorded archaeological sites in the
project area and vicinity. In addition, a thorough review of the existing literature for
Runnels and Taylor counties was conducted.
Field Survey
A 100% Pedestrian Survey of the 13 pre-selected areas was conducted in
February 2005. Eroded and otherwise exposed areas within the rights-of-way were
examined for surface indications of prehistoric and historic sites in each of the 13
areas. The subsurface was examined through shovel tests in five areas and
backhoe trenches in four areas. Area 10, was recommended for backhoe trenching
by Trask. However, it was physically impossible to get a backhoe into this area due
to thick woods. In order to sample the subsurface in this area, the backhoe was
used to expose a profile along the exposed cutbank. This exposure was visually
examined and profiled (Appendix II).
Each shovel test was recorded on a shovel test log (Appendix I) and
discussed in the project notes. Locations of shovel tests are depicted on drafted
maps in the Discussion of Areas Surveyed section below. The excavated matrix
was screened using 1/4-inch hardware cloth when possible. In some areas,
however, heavy clays made normal screening impossible. The matrix from these
tests was examined by manually breaking apart the clay. In all, 41 shovel tests
were excavated.
Backhoe trenches were excavated in those areas recommended for this
level of investigation by Trask (2004) when this task was possible. It should be
noted that backhoe trenching was not possible in Area 10 because of land access
and thickly wooded terrain and ill advised in Area 8 because of prior disturbance.
Each trench was excavated with a backhoe using a 36-inch bucket and dug to at
least the depth of the proposed construction or Area of Potential Affect (APE). The
profiles were examined for buried cultural materials and sketched in the field.
When possible, a sample of the removed fill was screened. In all, 4 backhoe
trenches were excavated. Each backhoe trench was documented in the field
notes. Locations of backhoe trenches are depicted on drafted maps in the
Discussion of Areas Surveyed section below. Drawings of the backhoe trench
profiles appear in Appendix III.

14

Prehistoric sites 41RN234 – 41RN236 were photographed and assigned
field numbers. The location of these sites is depicted on the proper USGS map
(Appendix IV). Later, site forms were submitted to TARL so that official trinomials
could be issued. In one area, two flakes were found in a very disturbed setting due
to clearing of vegetation. Since a thorough search of the exposed surface did not
produce additional artifacts, this locality is referred to here as an Isolated Find, and
it’s location is depicted on the USGS map in Appendix V.
The Project Archaeologist documented the project with a digital camera,
hand-held GPS, and field notes. A sample of artifacts from sites 41RN234 and
41RN235 was collected for analysis in the laboratory by a Lithic Specialist
(Appendix VI). These items are temporarily housed at BVRA. Since they were
found on private property, they will be returned to the landowner following the
conclusion of this project.

DISCUSSION OF AREAS SURVEYED
Area 1
This area is depicted on the Tuscola 7.5’ quadrangle (Figure 2). Surface
survey was recommended by Trask (2004:21) along the highest elevations that this
pipeline will cross for a distance of one kilometer along County Road 181 at
Lemons Gap (1.5 acres). Shovel testing was not recommended because of
exposed bedrock, lack of thick surface soils, and excellent ground exposure.
Lemons Gap is a distinct geographical landform, as there is a gap in the hills
and steep slopes rise upward from the road. At the time of this survey, the major
vegetation consisted of cedar and mesquite. The proposed waterline route passed
through clay soil with gravels. The one-kilometer segment was visually inspected
as recommended by Trask, and no shovel tests were excavated. Prior disturbance
consisted of bulldozing by the landowner in the recent past in order to create a
bench or level area into the hillside so a fence and road could be constructed. The
entire original surface had been removed as a result of this process.
Area 2
This area is depicted on the Shep 7.5’ quadrangle (Figure 3). Surface survey
and shovel testing was recommended by Trask (2004:21) at the Bluff Creek
crossing and County Road 194 for a distance of 50 meters on either side of this
drainage (.75 acres). The map of the area recommended for survey prepared by
AR Consultants, Inc. depicted an area greater than 50 meters. BVRA examined a
500-meter segment for this project.
At the time of this survey, the major vegetation consisted of cedar, mesquite,
and short grasses on both sides of Bluff Creek and both sides of County Road 194.
This area was visually inspected, and 14 shovel tests were excavated through the
clay loam over clay and soils containing only clay (Figure 10). The shovel tests in
this area varied from 20 to 50 cm and were negative. Two flakes were observed on
the surface on the north side of the creek and on the west side of the road in a
large area that had been scraped by a bulldozer to create a field road. The flakes
are viewed by BVRA as an indication of a site in the area. However, the sparse
number of artifacts in such a large area does not warrant a site number.

Area 3
This area is depicted on the Bradshaw 7.5’ quadrangle (Figure 4). Surface
survey and shovel testing was recommended by Trask (2004:21) at the Bluff Creek
crossing and County Road 186 for a distance of 500 meters on either side of this
drainage (.75 acres).
A 100% Pedestrian Survey was conducted on both sides of the county road,
and 7 shovel tests were excavated between 20 and 50 cm (Figure 11). The area
north of Bluff Creek was mostly in a plowed field with excellent surface visibility.
Near the creek, the landscape was covered with thick stands of mesquite and
various kinds of brush. The area south of the creek ran parallel to the creek and
consisted of a pasture with scattered stands of cedar and mesquite. The soils were
largely shallow clays, and one area contained a dark clay loam.

17

Figure 11. Survey Area 3, Shovel Test Locations
Area 4
This area is on the Bradshaw 7.5’ quadrangle (Figure 4). Surface survey and
shovel testing was recommended by Trask (2004:21) for a distance of 1.4
kilometers along County Road 196 where it parallels the east side of Bluff Creek
(2.1 acres).
At the time of this survey, this area was in pasture, and one section passed
through a plowed field. Both sides of the county road were visually inspected, and
no shovel tests were excavated due to a lack of deep soils as confirmed through
surface inspection and shovel probes. Scattered chert cobbles were observed in
the plowed field, but these specimens exhibited no evidence of testing or use. The
soils consisted of hard clay and gravels.
Area 5
This area is on the Bradshaw 7.5’ quadrangle (Figure 5). Surface survey
and shovel testing was recommended by Trask (2004:21) for a distance of 500
meters along County Road 173 where it traverses the slopes overlooking a tributary
of Elm Creek (0.75 acres). Trask incorrectly refers to Salt Branch as the nearby
drainage.

18

A 100% Pedestrian Survey was conducted on the east side of the county
road. At the time of this survey, the area was in short grass and cedar. Shovel
probes and surface inspection indicated that no deep soils were present.
Therefore, no shovel tests were excavated.
Area 6
This area is on the Bradshaw 7.5’ quadrangle (Figure 4). Surface survey and
shovel testing was recommended by Trask (2004:21) for a distance of 500 meters
on the east side of Farm-to-Market Road 2495 where it parallels Salt Branch (0.75
acres).
The survey crew examined the east side of the highway. The southern end
of this segment was on the upper part of an elevated landform and traversed the
area, which sloped to the north end. Part of the area was in pasture, and part was
in a plowed field. Surface inspection and shovel probes indicated that no deep
soils were present. Therefore, no shovel tests were excavated. A few chert
cobbles were observed in the plowed field, but they did not appear to have been
tested or used.
Area 7
This area is on the Novice West 7.5’ quadrangle (Figure 6). Surface survey
was recommended by Trask (2004:21) for a distance of 500 meters on the south
side of County Road 146 where it crosses an upland divide with bedrock exposure
(0.75 acres). Shovel testing was not recommended because of a lack of soils in this
area.
A 100% Pedestrian survey was conducted on both sides of the county road.
The surface inspection indicated that no deep soils were present. The landscape
consisted of limestone bedrock, gravels, and shallow clay. Therefore, no shovel
tests were excavated.
Area 8
This area is on the Hatchel 7.5’ quadrangle (Figure 7). Surface survey and
shovel testing was recommended by Trask (2004:21) for a distance of .19 miles
along County Road 356 and Private Road 3561 where they traverse the flood plain
of Elm Creek. It was also recommended that two backhoe trenches be excavated in
this area. In all, 0.46 acres was examined.

19

This area was described in Trask’s report as a 1.1-kilometer segment along
County Road 356 to the floodplain and then along Private Road 3561, which
traversed the floodplain of Elm Creek. This portion of the project area only follows
the county road for a short distance before turning onto the private road, which is
not in the floodplain. Rather, it is on an upland ridge, which has been disturbed by
a gravel quarry. A surface inspection revealed an absence of deep soils and a very
disturbed landscape (Figure 12). Therefore, no shovel tests or backhoe trenches
were excavated.

Figure 12. Previous Disturbance at Survey Area 8

20

Area 9
This area is on the Wilmeth 7.5’ quadrangle (Figure 8). Surface survey and
shovel testing was recommended by Trask (2004:21) for a distance of 700 meters
on the east side of County Road 275 and the south side of a transmission line that
traverses cross-country (1 acre).
A 100% Pedestrian Survey was conducted on the east side of the county
road and the transmission line that traversed cross-country. At the time of this
survey, this segment was in a plowed field with excellent surface visibility. The
subsurface was inspected through six shovel tests, which were dug to depths
ranging from 30 to 40 cm in a clay loam over clay (Figure 13). A scatter of chert
cobbles was observed throughout the plowed field. Analysis of a sample of these
materials indicated plowing had damaged them. There is no indication of use by
prehistoric groups.
Area 10
This area is on the Herring Ranch 7.5’ quadrangle (Figure 9). It was
recommended by Trask (2004:22) that two backhoe trenches be excavated on
either side of Valley Creek along County Road 267 within a 100-meter segment.
One backhoe trench was excavated. Backhoe Trench 4 was placed on the
east side of the creek and north side of the county road at the approximate location
of a proposed drill hole (Figure 14). This trench was excavated through a light
brown clay loam into reddish-brown clay with gravels at approximately 150 cm.
The proposed west side trench location could not be assessed by a backhoe
because of fences, trees, and the rough terrain. The road cut in this area, however,
presented a 1.5 meter deep profile running parallel to the location of the proposed
backhoe trench and only 3 meters to the south. Therefore, a 5-meter section was
cleaned and profiled, and the entire cut bank was visually inspected. The resulting
profile revealed a light brown clay loam overlying reddish-brown clay with gravels at
a depth of approximately two meters.

Area 11
This area is on the Herring Ranch 7.5’ quadrangle (Figure 9). It was
recommended by Trask (2004:22) that two backhoe trenches be excavated on
either side of Valley Creek along County Road 264 within a 100-meter segment
(0.15 acre).
A 100% Pedestrian Survey, supplemented by backhoe trenching, was
conducted on both sides of the county road crossing of the creek (Figure 15).
Along the road, chert cores and a few flakes were observed in the roadbed
paralleling the project area. Since no cultural materials were found in the two
backhoe trenches or outside the road right-of-way, BVRA believes that these
artifacts were brought to the area during road construction and may not be cultural.
Therefore, they were not photographed or counted. Figure 16 depicts the north wall
profile of Backhoe Trench 2. Backhoe Trench 2 was dug through reddish-brown
clay loam into reddish-brown clay loam at approximately 200 cm. At Backhoe
Trench 3 reddish-brown clay was encountered at approximately 200 cm.

Area 12
This area is on the Herring Ranch 7.5’ quadrangle (Figure 9). Surface
survey and shovel testing was recommended by Trask (2004:22) for a distance of
two kilometers along Farm-to-Market Road 2111 and a 1-kilometer segment along
County Road 264 (3 acres).
The survey crew examined the west side of Farm-to-Market Road 2111 and
the north side of the county road. In all, eight shovel tests were excavated to
depths between 10 and 40 cm (Figure 17). At the time of this survey, the ground
cover consisted of pasture, and soils observed were clay at or near the surface with
some gravel present. Three prehistoric sites (41RN234 – 41RN236) were located.
They are discussed In the Site Descriptions section below.

Figure 17. Survey Area 12, Shovel Test Locations

Area 13
This area is on the Herring Ranch7.5’ quadrangle (Figure 9). Surface
survey and shovel testing was recommended by Trask (2004:22) for a distance of
400 meters on both sides of Valley Creek along County Road 293 (0.6 acre). It
was also recommended that one backhoe trench be excavated at the approximate
location where the water line will be bored under the drainage.
A 100% Pedestrian Survey was conducted on the east and west sides of
Valley Creek south of the county road through six shovel tests and one backhoe
trench (Figure 18). The shovel tests were dug through a clay loam over clay to
depths of 20 and 30 cm, and Backhoe Trench 1 was dug to at least four feet
through a brown clay loam mixed with small gravels into a stratum containing
caliche. At the time of this survey, this segment was in pasture with scattered
stands of trees. Some gravel was noted on the surface.

SITE DESCRIPTIONS
41RN234
This is a lithic procurement site in north Runnels County where local chert
cobbles were tested by prehistoric groups for use in the manufacture of stone tools.
It is located on the west toe slope of an elevated landform overlooking Valley Creek
0.8 miles to the west at an elevation of 1754 feet (Figure 19). At this area, the
Colorado River is approximately 6 miles distant. The site was identified during the
Pedestrian Survey. Artifacts were observed scattered over a deflated surface
consisting of a very firm red clay belonging to the Potter Series as identified in the
soil survey for Runnels County (Wiedenfeld et al. 1970:18-20). These soils are
described as nearly level to moderately steep soils that are less than 10 inches
deep over cemented caliche. These soils developed in plains outwash, and slopes
are convex.
It was not possible to determine the size of this site in all directions because
of the limitations imposed by the narrow easement. Based on the presence of
artifacts on the surface, it appears that the north-south axis of this site is at least 90
meters long. The east-west axis could not be determined. No formal map was
prepared due to the restrictions of movement because of the narrow easement.
The age of this site is not known as no temporally diagnostic artifacts were
observed.
A sample of artifacts was collected for analysis. The sample consisted of 2
bifaces, 2 cores, 6 core fragments, 7 flakes, 1 macro-flake spall, and 2 tested
cobbles. William A. Dickens analyzed these specimens. The results of this
analysis and photographs of the artifacts appear in Appendix VI. It was concluded
that these artifacts are typical of a lithic procurement site.
The eligibility of this site cannot be assessed based on the limited area
observed during this survey. Should future work at site 41RN236 determine it to be
eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places or for designation as a
State Archeological Landmark, that portion of the site within the Area of Potential
Affect would not contribute to the site’s eligibility.

41RN235
This is a lithic procurement site in north Runnels County where local chert
cobbles were tested by prehistoric groups for use in the manufacture of stone
tools). It is located on the west toe slope of an elevated landform overlooking
Valley Creek 1.1 miles to the west at an elevation of 1754 feet (Figure 20). At this
area, the Colorado River is approximately 6.5 miles distant. The site was identified
during the Pedestrian Survey. Artifacts were observed scattered over a deflated
surface consisting of a very firm red clay belonging to the Potter Series as identified
in the soil survey for Runnels County (Wiedenfeld et al. 1970:18-20). These soils
are described as nearly level to moderately steep soils that are less than 10 inches
deep over cemented caliche. These soils developed in plains outwash, and slopes
are convex.
It was not possible to determine the size of this site in all directions because
of the limitations imposed by the narrow easement. Based on the presence of
artifacts on the surface, it appears that the north-south axis of this site is at least
322 meters (.2 miles) long. The east-west axis could not be determined. No formal
map was prepared due to the restrictions of movement because of the narrow
easement. The age of this site is not known as no temporally diagnostic artifacts
were observed
A sample of artifacts was collected for analysis, which consisted of 3 bifaces,
5 cores, 8 core fragments, 9 flakes, 1 macro-flake spall, and 4 tested cobbles. No
other cultural materials were observed. William A. Dickens analyzed the artifacts.
The results of this analysis and photographs of the artifacts appear in Appendix VI.
It was concluded that these artifacts are typical of a lithic procurement site.
The eligibility of this site cannot be assessed based on the limited area
observed during this survey. Should future work at site 41RN236 determine it to be
eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places or for designation as a
State Archeological Landmark, that portion of the site within the Area of Potential
Affect would not contribute to the site’s eligibility.

41RN236
This is a lithic procurement site in north Runnels County where local chert
cobbles were tested by prehistoric groups for use in the manufacture of stone tools.
It is located on the west slope of an elevated landform overlooking Valley Creek 0.9
miles to the west at an elevation of 1806 feet (Figure 21). At this area, the
Colorado River is approximately 7 miles distant. The site was identified during the
Pedestrian Survey. Artifacts were observed scattered over a deflated surface
consisting of a a very firm red clay belonging to the Potter Series as identified in the
soil survey for Runnels County (Wiedenfeld et al. 1970:18-20). These soils are
described as nearly level to moderately steep soils that are less than 10 inches
deep over cemented caliche. These soils developed in plains outwash, and slopes
are convex.
It was not possible to determine the size of this site in all directions because
of the limitations imposed by the narrow easement. Based on the presence of
artifacts on the surface, it appears that the east-west axis of this site is at least 0.34
miles long. The north-south axis could not be determined. No formal map was
prepared due to the restrictions of movement because of the narrow easement.
The age of this site is not known as no temporally diagnostic artifacts were
observed.
The clay, gravel, and caliche surface was littered with large limestone
chunks and some chert cobbles. Many of the cobbles had been tested as
evidenced by flake scars where flakes had been removed, ostensibly to test the raw
material for its flint knapping potential. In addition, some primary cortex flakes were
observed. The ratio of chert cobbles to limestone chunks was very low, and the
chert was spread over the entire area with no identifiable concentrations. A sample
of the raw material was collected at the request of the Lithic Specialist who wanted
to see examples of raw material from each site.
The eligibility of this site cannot be assessed based on the limited area
observed during this survey. Should future work at site 41RN236 determine it to be
eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places or for designation as a
State Archeological Landmark, that portion of the site within the Area of Potential
Affect would not contribute to the site’s eligibility.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The site records at TARL indicated an absence of recorded archaeological
sites within the path of the water line as currently proposed. The only previous
work in the area identified during the archival research was the archaeological
evaluation by A.R. Consultants, Inc. (Trask 2004). The entire water line was
visited, and 13 areas were recommended for survey. Numerous prehistoric sites
have been recorded in the general area, and all are located in close proximity to
major creeks and rivers.
Three lithic procurement sites (41RN234 – 41RN236) were found within one
of the 13 pre-selected areas. These are areas where chert cobbles have eroded
from a limestone matrix and are scattered across the landscape. Prehistoric
groups visited these areas and tested the cobbles for their potential to manufacture
stone tools. They also reduced some of the cobbles to bifaces for transport to other
locations where they could be made into formal tools. In some cases, these early
stage bifaces were abandoned on site as not suitable for continued reduction. This
appears to be the case with the bifaces found at sites 41RN234 and 41RN235.
Lithic procurement sites ares common in this part of Texas, and their presence was
not a surprise to the survey crew. No activities or artifacts associated with a
habitation or long-term occupation of these areas were found.
The size of these sites could not be determined because the project area
was limited to a 20-foot wide easement. It is probable that they extend beyond the
Area of Potential Affect, but this could not be confirmed during this survey. In
addition to a larger sample of artifacts outside the project area, features such as
hearths or burned rock accumulations may be present.
The portions of the three recorded sites (41RN234 – 41RN236) within the
project area are situated on deflated surfaces and contained no temporally
diagnostic artifacts or features. Since all observed artifacts were collected, these
areas are not viewed by BVRA as significant or worthy of additional work. There

RECOMMENDATIONS
Portions of three archaeological sites (41RN234, 41RN235, 41RN236) were
found in the project area. The proposed construction will not affect cultural
properties eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Properties or for
designation as a State Archeological Landmark. Therefore, it is recommended that
the North Runnels WSC be allowed to proceed with their water supply line
construction as planned. It should be noted that these sites have not been fully
assessed. If the Area of Potential Affect changes to include impacts beyond the
portions of the sites examined, further survey may be required. This project was
conducted following the Minimum Survey Standards defined by the Texas Historical
Commission, Archeology Division.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES

ISOLATED FIND

APPENDIX VI: LITHIC ANALYSIS
Artifacts were collected from lithic quarry sites 41RN234 and 41RN235.
These materials consist of chert bifaces, cores, core fragments, and flakes that
were randomly selected from surface exposures at these sites. In another area
(TS-4), natural cobbles were collected; however, this area is not considered to be
an archaeological site. A discussion of these artifacts follows.
41RN234
A sample of 20 lithic artifacts was collected from this area. They are 2
bifaces, 2 cores, 6 core fragments, 7 flakes, 1 macro-flake spall, and 2 tested
cobbles. The bifaces, cores, core fragments, flakes, and macro-flake spall are
discussed in detail below.
The two bifaces represent early stage reduction (Stage II) types. They
lack cortex on the majority of their surface and are only roughly shaped by
percussion flaking. The edges are sinuous and sharp with some battering
present. Some of the flake scars contain deep negative bulb impressions typical
of hard hammer removals. One biface (Figure 1a) is 109.4 mm long, 70.9 mm
wide, and 35.6 mm thick. The second biface (Figure 1b) is 80.1 mm long, 63.4
mm wide, and 21.7 mm thick. Both specimens are made from a reddish-brown,
semi-translucent chert. The larger specimen has a more solid reddish color,
which may be the result from long-term exposure to the soil. Neither contains
material or knapping flaws to suggest whey were abandoned.
The two cores are small, blocky cobbles that have had most of their
surfaces flaked. Both retain small areas covered in cortex. One core is 56.9 mm
long, 49.4 mm long, and 19.3 mm thick. The second core is 77.7 mm long, 67.9
mm wide, and 39.1 mm thick. The smaller core has squared edges ranging
between 70° and 90° while the larger specimen retains its blocky shape. The
smaller core is randomly flaked. The larger core has had several blade-like
removals flaked from one of its sides in a distal-to-proximal pattern (Figure 1c),
while the other side exhibits a more random lateral pattern of flake removal.
The six core fragments are small and range in size from 44 mm to 51 mm
long, 29 mm to 50 mm wide, and 20 mm to 26 mm thick. Only one lacks cortex.
Two specimens contain potlids from surface fires. Otherwise, no evidence of
thermal alternation is present. The flaking on these specimens is similar to the
larger, more complete cores, which were reduced through the hard hammer
percussion method.
The chert types are gray or reddish-brown, semitranslucent.

Figure 1. Artifacts from 41RN234

Seven flakes were recovered. They are large with six exceeding one inch
(Size Grade 3) and one exceeding 1.5 inch (Size Grade 2). All are secondary
with 0 to 90% of their surface covered in cortex. All contain natural cortex
covered striking platforms, and four have prominent bulbs of percussion. No
evidence of thermal alternation is present. The chert utilized is consistent with
the other artifacts.

2

Two tested cobbles were collected. Both are small cobbles and have only
one or two flake removals. These removals were the result of testing of the
material for internal flaws and flaking quality. No particular reason for their
rejection is evident other than their small size
One large macro-flake spall was also recovered. It is a secondary flake
and measures 88.1 mm long, 80.9 mm wide, and 42.8 mm thick. A large single
flake has been removed from the center of the dorsal surface, and the cortex on
the dorsal surface wraps around one side onto the ventral surface.
All of the materials from 41RN234 are consistent with those found at
primary quarry procurement sites. The bifaces, cores, core fragments, and
flakes have been randomly and crudely flaked by the percussion method. The
single exception is one of the cores, which contains more regular blade-like
removals. Overall, these materials are initial reductive types with no formal tools
present such as projectile points, knives, or scrapers that would be found at a
quarry/camp (Dickens and Dockall 1993). Also, all of the artifacts are made of
the same type materials, either light gray or a reddish-brown, semi-translucent
chert. No diagnostics were recovered that can accurately date this site, but the
large bifaces suggest this quarry area may have been visited during Archaic
times.
41RN235
A sample of 30 lithic artifacts was collected from this area. They are 3
bifaces, 5 cores, 8 core fragments, 9 flakes, 1 macro-flake spall, and 4 tested
cobbles. The bifaces, cores, core fragments, flakes, and macro-flake spall are
discussed in detail below. These specimens are illustrated in Figure 2.
The three bifaces represent early stage reduction with one being Stage I
and the others Stage II. The Stage I biface (Figure 2a) is 108.3 mm long, 66.4
mm wide, and 19.8 mm thick. It is made on a thin tabular piece of reddish-brown
chert. The only flaking consists of some removals from either end on one face
and from one end on the other face. No obvious reason is noted for its rejection.
The remaining two bifaces are Stage II types with most of their cortex absent.
One is an oval form, and the other is a triangular shape. The oval biface is
smaller and measures 70.7 mm long, 66.7 mm wide, and 20.1 mm thick. It is
depicted in Figure 2b. Some pot-lidding is present on one of its lateral edges that
probably occurred after it was discarded. The other oval biface (Figure 2c)
measures 85.6 mm long, 77.8 mm wide, and 36.1 mm thick. Both specimens
contain large flake scars, many with deep negative bulb impressions evident.
This is typical of reduction by the hard hammer percussion method. Also, both
specimens are made from reddish-brown, semi-translucent chert.

Figure 2. Artifacts from 41RN235

The five cores are made on large cobbles. Several have obviously
reduced to a much smaller state than the original size by multiple flake removals,
but the majority have had only been minimally flaked. Some flake scars are large
with deep negative bulb impressions. Other flake scars are smaller, some with
battered and crushed edges. Only one specimen contains potlids, and it is
restricted to the original cortical covering. Materials include gray or reddishbrown semi-translucent chert.
The eight core fragments are smaller versions of the larger; more
complete cores, albeit fragmentary. They range in size from 47 mm to 79 mm in
length, 33 mm to 52 mm in width, and 16 to 35 mm in thickness. All have varying
amounts of cortex present with one being a primary type. Most flake removals
are small with many ending in hinge type terminations. Chert types are
consistent with the previous forms (bifaces and cores).
Four tested cobbles were recovered. All are moderately sized cobbles
with one appearing to be the end of a larger cobble. Minimal flake removals
(three or less) are evident on all, and one appears to have been part of a much
older fractured cobble as evidenced by the difference in patina. No apparent
reason for rejection was observed.
A total of nine flakes were collected. Five are Size Grade 3, with two
being primary and three secondary. All have prominent bulbs of percussion and
plain platforms. The remaining four specimens are Size Grade 2, and three are
primary. Two of the primary flakes have natural platforms, and one is plain. All
of the bulbs of percussion are slight to diffuse (flat). Some of the flakes have a
gray-white patina present, but all exhibit their original color – either a gray or
reddish-brown, semi-translucent type of material.
A single large macro-flake spall was collected. It measures 114.6 mm
long, 79.2 mm wide, and 45.2 mm thick. It is a primary flake with some cortex
wrapping onto the ventral surface. The platform is crushed, and no bulb of
percussion is present. It is made of a gray chert, and no evidence of thermal
alternation was observed.
All of the materials from 41RN235 are consistent with those found at
primary quarry procurement sites. The early stage bifaces, cores, core
fragments, flakes, and the macro-flake spall are typical of initial quarry
procurement and reduction materials. Like 41RN234, no formal tools or
diagnostic artifacts were recovered that can accurately date this site. That these
artifacts are similar to those found at 41RN234 suggests a similar period of
usage at the two sites.

5

TS-4
A sample of 21 chert cobbles and debris was collected from this site. All
specimens are fractured to some degree. These fractures are irregular, and
many of the specimens exhibit heavily battered edges. Potlids are present, and
in some cases they are severe. No site number was assigned to this area.
Although some of this material contains split cobbles, fracture scars with
negative bulbs of percussion, and pieces with prominent bulbs of percussion, the
damage is more consistent with that resulting from gravel operations rather than
by prehistoric cultural activity. Such cobble splitting and edge crushing is a
common occurrence as a result of quarrying and subsequent size separation
activities involving machinery. Pressures exerted from the movements of gravels
occurring during these operations can easily produce attributes similar to those
created through prehistoric reduction technologies. Based on the physical
attributes of the recovered cherts, not one can be definitely classified as having
been modified or altered by prehistoric groups. These materials may have been
deposited in the area during road construction or maintenance.
Conclusions
Based on the artifacts collected from sites 41RN234 and 41RN235, these
areas are representative of typical lithic quarry sites. The various artifacts are all
typical of lithic debris that results from procurement or quarrying activities
(Dickens and Dockall 1993). Activities occurring on such sites include (1) initial
biface reduction/creation where only early stage bifaces are produced, (2) macroflake spall production where large flakes were produced to be made into a variety
of tools and used in a number of activites, and (3) small flake production. Since
varying amounts of time were often spent at quarries, some subsistence tools are
sometimes encountered. The lack of such tools at 41RN234 and 41RN235 does
not eliminate their presence, especially since only a small portion of each site
was investigated.
The material from TS-4 contains damage that is not representative of a
prehistoric quarry. It is, rather, more consistent with damage resulting from
modern quarrying activities. All of the chert cobbles in the sample contain
battered edges and fractures typical of pressures resulting from movements of
large amounts of materials where crushing and pressures exerted cause
fractures and damage similar to prehistoric activities.
