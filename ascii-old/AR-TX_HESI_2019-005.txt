MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) was selected by LJA Engineering, Inc.
(LJA) on behalf of Orange County to conduct an intensive cultural resources inventory and
assessment for the proposed Old Spanish Trail Roadway Improvements Project south of Vidor in
Orange County, Texas. The proposed undertaking would involve expanding and improving the
existing two-lane gravel roadway of Old Spanish Trail. The project area extends approximately
0.8 kilometer (0.5 mile) in length from the intersection of Old Spanish Trail and Red Oak Street
northwestward to a flood-control levee located approximately 0.2 kilometer (0.1 mile) south of
Ofiel Road. The existing right-of-way (ROW) of Old Spanish Trail measures roughly 10.0 meters
(32.8 feet) in width. The proposed roadway improvements would involve construction within an
expanded ROW measuring approximately 50.0 meters (164.0 feet) in width, including a
combination of existing and proposed new ROW. For purposes of the cultural resources survey,
the project area is considered to consist of the 0.8-kilometer- (0.5-mile-) long by 50.0-meter(164.0-foot-) wide project area, covering a total area of approximately 4.0 hectares (9.9 acres).
The proposed undertaking is being sponsored by Orange County, a political subdivision
of the state of Texas; as such, the project would fall under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code
of Texas (Natural Resources Code, Title 9, Chapter 191). At this time, no federal permits,
licenses, or funds have been identified for the project. As the project represents a publicly
sponsored undertaking, the project sponsor is required to provide the Texas Historical
Commission (THC), which serves as the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) for the state
of Texas, with an opportunity to review and comment on the project’s potential to adversely affect
historic properties listed on or considered eligible for designation as State Antiquities Landmarks
(SAL).
On April 19, 2019, Horizon archeologist Charles E. Bludau conducted an intensive cultural
resources survey of the project area. The survey was conducted under the overall direction of
Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator, under Texas Antiquities Permit no. 8874. The purpose
of the survey was to locate any significant cultural resources that potentially would be impacted
by the proposed undertaking. Horizon’s archeologist traversed the tract and thoroughly inspected
the modern ground surface for aboriginal and historic-age cultural resources. The existing ROW
of Old Spanish Trail consists of a two-lane gravel road with no shoulders. The proposed new
ROW to the east of the existing roadway consists of short-grass pastures. A large pond is present
to the southwest. Visibility of the modern ground surface was typically fair to good (30 to 60%).

Management Summary

In addition to pedestrian walkover, the Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey
Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile per 30.5-meter (100.0-foot)
width of proposed ROW or fraction thereof for linear projects. As such, a minimum of 16 shovel
tests would be required within the 0.8-kilometer- (0.5-mile-) long by 50.0-meter- (164.0-foot-) wide
project area. Horizon excavated a total of 17 shovel tests during the survey, thereby exceeding
the TSMASS requirements for a project area of this size. Shovel testing typically revealed shallow
to moderately deep deposits of sandy loam overlying sandy clay at depths ranging from 5.0 to
60.0 centimeters (1.9 to 23.6 inches) below surface (typically in the range of 30.0 to
60.0 centimeters [11.8 to 23.6 inches] below surface), though deep sandy sediments were
observed in two shovel tests extending to a depth of 1.0 meter (3.3 feet) or more below surface.
Sediments in a few than half of the shovel tests exhibited iron staining, suggesting that the project
area experiences at least seasonally, if not permanently, high water tables. It is Horizon’s opinion
that sediments with the potential to contain subsurface archeological deposits were fully
penetrated and that the project area was adequately assessed for cultural resources.
No cultural resources of historic or prehistoric age were observed on the modern ground
surface or within any of the shovel tests excavated within the project area during the survey.
Based on the results of the survey-level investigations documented in this report, no
potentially significant cultural resources would be affected by the proposed undertaking. In
accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, Horizon has made a reasonable and good-faith effort to identify
historic properties within the project area. No cultural resources were identified within the project
area that meet the criteria for designation as SALs according to 13 TAC 26 or for inclusion in the
NRHP under 36 CFR 60.4. Horizon recommends a finding of “no historic properties affected,”
and no further archeological work is recommended in connection with the proposed undertaking.
However, human burials, both prehistoric and historic, are protected under the Texas Health and
Safety Code. In the event that any human remains or burial objects are inadvertently discovered
at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance in the project area, even in
previously surveyed areas, all work should cease immediately in the vicinity of the inadvertent
discovery, and the Texas Historical Commission (THC) should be notified immediately.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) was selected by LJA Engineering, Inc.
(LJA) on behalf of Orange County to conduct an intensive cultural resources inventory and
assessment for the proposed Old Spanish Trail Roadway Improvements Project south of Vidor in
Orange County, Texas. The proposed undertaking would involve expanding and improving the
existing two-lane gravel roadway of Old Spanish Trail. The project area extends approximately
0.8 kilometer (0.5 mile) in length from the intersection of Old Spanish Trail and Red Oak Street
northwestward to a flood-control levee located approximately 0.2 kilometer (0.1 mile) south of
Ofiel Road. The existing right-of-way (ROW) of Old Spanish Trail measures roughly 10.0 meters
(32.8 feet) in width. The proposed roadway improvements would involve construction within an
expanded ROW measuring approximately 50.0 meters (164.0 feet) in width, including a
combination of existing and proposed new ROW. For purposes of the cultural resources survey,
the project area is considered to consist of the 0.8-kilometer- (0.5-mile-) long by 50.0-meter(164.0-foot-) wide project area, covering a total area of approximately 4.0 hectares (9.9 acres)
(Figures 1 to 3).
The proposed undertaking is being sponsored by Orange County, a political subdivision

Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator, under Texas Antiquities Permit no. 8874. The purpose
of the survey was to locate any significant cultural resources that potentially would be impacted
by the proposed undertaking. The cultural resources investigation consisted of an archival review,
an intensive pedestrian survey of the project area, and the production of a report suitable for
review by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the THC’s Rules of

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The project area is located in southwestern Orange County, Texas. Orange County is
situated on the Gulf Coastal Plain in southeastern Texas, and the project area is located about
48.3 kilometers (30.0 miles) northwest of the Gulf of Mexico shoreline. The Gulf of Mexico
represents a structural basin formed by lithosphere deformation. The Texas Coastal Plain, which
extends as far north as the Ouachita uplift in southern Oklahoma and westward to the Balcones
Escarpment, consists of seaward-dipping bodies of sedimentary rock, most of which are of
terrigenous clastic origin, that reflect the gradual infilling of the basin from its margins (Abbott
2001). The Beaumont area is underlain by rocks and unconsolidated sediments that are quite
young in a geological sense, ranging from modern to Miocene in age. These consist
predominantly of a series of fluviodeltaic bodies arranged in an offlapped sequence, with
interdigitated and capping eolian, littoral, and estuarine facies making up a relatively minor
component of the lithology. Major bounding disconformities between these formations are usually
interpreted to represent depositional hiatuses that occurred during periods of sea level low stand.
The oldest rocks in this fill are of Late Cretaceous age. As a result of the geometry of basin filling,
successively younger rock units crop out in subparallel bands from the basin margin toward the
modern coastline.
The project area is situated on a flast coastal terrace that forms the northeastern margin
of a broad mud flat on the floodplain of the Neches River to the southwest. No natural streams
cross the project area, though several large ponds and marshy features are located nearby. Local
topography is relatively flat, and elevations across the project area range from approximately
3.6 to 4.6 meters (12.0 to15.0 feet) above mean sea level (amsl) with minimal natural topographic
relief. Drainage is generally to the southwest toward the Neches River floodplain.

2.2

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

The project area is underlain by the Beaumont Formation (Shelby et al. 1968). The
Beaumont, or Prairie, terrace is the youngest continuous coastwise terrace fronting the modern
Gulf (Abbott 2001). The Beaumont Formation consists of clay, silt, and fine sand arranged in
spatial patterns that reflect the distribution of fluvial (e.g., channel, point bar, levee, and
backswamp) and mudflat/coastal marsh facies (Van Siclen 1985). Sandy deposits associated

B879-1001.300

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

with littoral facies are also frequently considered part of the Beaumont. Many investigators (cf.
DuBar et al. 1991; Fisk 1938, 1940) have correlated the Beaumont terrace with the Sangamon
Interglacial (ca. 130 to 75 thousand years ago [kya]), although age estimates range from Middle
Wisconsinan (Alford and Holmes 1985) to 100 to 600 kya (Blum and Price 1994). While debate
about the temporal affiliations of and correlations among the deposits that underlie the major
coastline terraces remains active, they are of little direct geoarcheological relevance because
virtually all investigators agree that these deposits considerably predate the earliest demonstrated
dates of human occupation in North America.
The project area is characterized by two separate soil units (Table 1; Figure 4) (NRCS
2019). The vast majority of the project area is characterized by Belrose loamy fine sand, 0 to 3%
slopes (BelB), while a very small area at the northern end of the project area is mapped as
Belrose-Caneyhead frequently ponded complex, 0 to 1% slopes (BemA). Both soil units are
composed of Quaternary-age loamy and sandy alluvial deposits.
Aboriginal cultural resources are commonly encountered in deep alluvial sediments
adjacent to major streams in Texas; however, the relative antiquity of the alluvial soil units within
the project area suggests that any cultural resources would be constrained to the modern ground
surface or in shallowly buried contexts. Intact, deeply buried archeological deposits may occur
within alluvial sediments of Holocene age near major streams. However, the alluvial sediments
within the project area are relatively mature and appear to pre-date the Holocene epoch. Historicage cultural resources may occur in any physiographic setting but are comparatively rare in the
remote, marshy lowlands of the coastal plain.

2.3

CLIMATE

Evidence for climatic change from the Pleistocene to the present is most often obtained
through studies of pollen and faunal sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Collins 1995). While
the paleoclimatic history of the coastal region remains unclear, Bryant and Holloway (1985)
present a sequence of climatic change for nearby east-central Texas that includes three separate
climatic periods—the Wisconsin Full Glacial Period (22,500 to 14,000 B.P.), the Late Glacial
Period (14,000 to 10,000 B.P.), and the Post-Glacial Period (10,000 B.P. to present). Evidence
from the Wisconsin Full Glacial Period suggests that the climate in east-central Texas was
considerably cooler and more humid than at present. Pollen data indicate that the region was
more heavily forested in deciduous woodlands than during later periods (Bryant and Holloway
1985). The Late Glacial Period was characterized by slow climatic deterioration and a slow
warming and/or drying trend (Collins 1995). In east-central Texas, the deciduous woodlands were
gradually replaced by grasslands and post oak savannas (Bryant and Holloway 1985). During
the Post-Glacial Period, the east-central Texas environment appears to have been more stable.
The deciduous forests had long since been replaced by prairies and post oak savannas. The
drying and/or warming trend that began in the Late Glacial Period continued into the midHolocene, at which point there appears to have been a brief amelioration to more mesic conditions
lasting from roughly 6000 to 5000 B.P. Recent studies by Bryant and Holloway (1985) indicate
that modern environmental conditions in east-central Texas were probably achieved by
1,500 years ago.
The modern climate of the upper Texas coast is classified as subtropical humid (Abbott
2001; Larkin and Bomar 1983), forming a transitional zone between the humid southeastern US
and the semiarid to arid west. The climate reflects the influences of latitude, low elevation, and
proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, which combine with the urban heat islands formed by the
tremendous concentrations of asphalt and concrete in the larger cities, such as Houston and
Beaumont, to create a notorious modern climate that is oppressively warm and moist throughout
much of the year. As a result of proximity to the Gulf and the abundance of surface water, humidity
in the early morning can approach 100% even on cloudless summer days, and it often exceeds
50% even on the warmest afternoons. Largely as a consequence of the relatively high humidity
characteristic of the region, temperature patterns exhibit a moderate annual range and a modest
diurnal range that increases slightly with distance from the coast. Average monthly high
temperature ranges from a low of 17 to 19°Celcius (°C) (59 to 63°Fahrenheit [°F]) in January to a
high of 38 to 40°C (89 to 96°F) in August. Average monthly lows range from 4 to 9°C (38 to 47°F)
in January to 25 to 29°C (72 to 79°F) in July and August. Annually, average low temperatures
range from 15 to 21°C (56 to 65°F), and average high temperatures range from 27 to 29°C (75 to
79°F) (Abbott 2001; Larkin and Bomar 1983).
The region experiences two precipitation peaks throughout the year (Abbott 2001). The
first occurs in the late spring (i.e., May to June) due to the passage of infrequent cold fronts that
spawn chains of powerful frontal thunderstorms. The second occurs in the late summer to early
autumn (i.e., August to September) due to the incidence of tropical storms and hurricanes from
the Atlantic and, occasionally, Pacific oceans. In contrast, winter and early spring are relatively
dry, and high summer rainfall is dominated by convectional thunderstorms that are relatively brief

10

Proposed Old Spanish Trail Roadway Improvements Project, Orange County, Texas

and localized, albeit frequently intense. Average annual precipitation varies from a low of
approximately 101.6 centimeters (40.0 inches) to a high of more than 132.1 centimeters
(52.0 inches). Average monthly precipitation varies from less than 5.1 to 7.6 centimeters (2.0 to
3.0 inches) in March to more than 19.1 centimeters (7.5 in) occurring locally on the coast during
September. Almost all of the measurable precipitation falls as rain—snowfall is extremely rare,
occurring in measurable amounts in only 1 in 10 years.

2.4

FLORA AND FAUNA

Orange County is situated near the southeastern edge of the Texan biotic province (Blair
1950), an intermediate zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian provinces
and the grasslands of the Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces. Some species reach
the limits of their ecological range within the Texas province. McMahan et al. (1984) further define
four broad communities that characterize that portion of the Texas biotic province that lies on the
Gulf Coastal Plain: (1) coastal marsh/barrier island, (2) coastal prairie, (3) coastal gallery forest,
and (4) pine-hardwood forest (cf. Abbott 2001:24-26).
The coastal marsh/barrier island category includes well-drained, sandy, coastal
environments and saline and freshwater wetlands in the coastal zone (Abbott 2001:24). Marsh
vegetation is typical of areas that are seasonally wet and have substrates composed primarily of
sands and silts, clays, or organic decomposition products. Vegetation assemblages are strongly
controlled by texture, salinity, frequency and duration of inundation, and depth of the seasonal
water table. Sandy, relatively well-drained, freshwater environments are typically dominated by
little bluestem, switchgrass, Florida paspalum, and brownseed paspalum. Wetter environments
are often dominated by marshhay cordgrass, seashore saltgrass, saggitaria, bulrushes, smooth
cordgrass, seashore paspalum, seashore dropseed, olney bulrush, saltmarsh bulrush, saltmarsh
aster, longtom, sprangletop, burhead, arrowhead, coastal waterhyssop, needlegrass rush, and
other sedges and rushes. Slightly higher, better-drained environments are characterized by such
taxa as seashore saltgrass, seashore paspalum, gulfdune paspalum, shoregrass, gulf cordgrass,
red lovegrass, bushy sea-oxey, and glasswort. A variety of fauna are characteristic of the shore
zone. Important larger taxa include raccoon, nutria, alligators, turtles, swamp rabbit, and many
birds, including ducks, geese, herons, and many smaller species. Aquatic taxa, including a wealth
of fish and shellfish adapted to brackish to hypersaline conditions, are also important in the coastal
zone.
The coastal prairie category consists primarily of grasses with minor amounts of forbs and
woody plants in areas that are not saturated on a seasonal basis (Abbott 2001:24-26). This
community is characteristic of upland areas and grades into the pine-hardwood forest to the north
and east and into the coastal marsh/barrier island to the south. A wide variety of grasses are
found in the prairie environments, but the principal taxa include big bluestem, little bluestem,
indiangrass, eastern grama, switchgrass, brownseed paspalum, sideoats grama, silver bluestem,
buffalograss, threeawn, and Texas wintergrass. Common forbs include Maximilian sunflower,
Engelmann daisy, blacksalmon, penstemon, dotted gayfeather, bundleflower, yellow neptunia,
snoutbean, prairie clover, tickclover, wildbean, western indigo, paintbrush, bluebonnet, ragweed,
croton, milkweed, vetch, verbena, and winecup. Woody plants occurring in the coastal prairie

B879-1001.300

11

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

include mesquite, honey locust, huisache, eastern baccharis, sesbania, live oak, elm, hackberry,
bumelia, and coralberry. The frequency of trees increases dramatically as the coastal prairie
grades into the pine-hardwood forest, forming an open woodland environment with common
stands of hardwood trees and occasional pines. The coastal prairie is home to a diverse fauna,
including coyote, white-tailed deer, skunks, cottontail rabbit, many small rodents, amphibians,
reptiles, and a variety of permanent and migratory birds. Bison and pronghorn were also present
at various times in the past.
The coastal gallery forest consists of diverse, principally deciduous trees and associated
understory in floodplains and streams that traverse the outer coastal plain (Abbott 2001:26).
Important taxa include water oak, pecan, poplar, American elm, cedar elm, sugarberry, ash,
loblolly pine, post oak, cherrybark oak, mulberry, swamp chestnut oak, willow oak, sweetgum,
hawthorn, dogwood, hickory, bois d’arc, sassafras cypress, willow, cottonwood, and sumac.
Shrubs and vines such as mustang grape, greenbrier, yaupon, coralberry, possumhaw,
elderberry, honeysuckle, dewberry, and blackberry are common in the understory, as are grasses
such as little bluestem, big bluestem, and indiangrass. The fauna of the gallery forest include
white-tailed deer, opossum, raccoon, squirrel, turkey, a variety of small mammals and rodents,
turtles, snakes, and many birds. A number of fish and a few varieties of shellfish are present in
the streams.
The pine-hardwood forest is characterized by a mix of coniferous and deciduous trees,
including longleaf pine, shortleaf pine, loblolly pine, post oak, red oak, white oak, blackjack oak,
willow oak, and live oak (Abbott 2001:26). Riparian environments often support larger deciduous
trees like pecan, cottonwood, hickory, beech, and American elm. Understory vegetation varies
from relatively open to quite dense, and consists of shrubs, vines, forbs, and young trees.
Common shrubs include acacia, yaupon, mayhaw, wild persimmon, myrtle, greenbrier, Virginia
creeper, blackberry, dewberry, trumpet vine, gourd, and poison ivy. A variety of fauna is also
present, including white-tailed deer, opossum, raccoon, squirrel, rabbit, mink, skunk, various small
rodents, turtles, reptiles, and many different birds. Black bears were also present at times in the
past, and bison and pronghorn were occasionally present in the transition zone to the coastal
prairie environment.

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey for the
Proposed Old Spanish Trail Roadway Improvements Project, Orange County, Texas

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The project area is located within the Southeast Texas Archeological Region, a 21-county
area extending from the Colorado River on the west to the Sabine River on the east and
measuring about 200.0 kilometers (124.0 miles) inland from the Gulf of Mexico coastline. Much
of the archeological record in Southeast Texas represents an interface between the Southern
Great Plains and the Southeastern Woodlands (Aten 1983, 1984; Patterson 1995; Story 1990).
Further distinctions are often made between the inland and coastal margin subregions of
Southeast Texas. These two subregions are somewhat culturally distinct, and the inland
subregion has a much longer chronological record. The coastal margin of Southeast Texas
comprises a zone about 25.7 kilometers (16.0 miles) inland from the coast that covers the area
influenced by Gulf tidal flows on the salinity of streams, lakes, and bays. Considerable ecological
variability characterizes this subregion, including woodlands, coastal prairie, lakes, wetlands,
marine coastline, and barrier islands. The inland subregion also encompasses considerable
ecological diversity, including mixed woodlands, coastal prairies, and dense piney woods.
The human inhabitants of Southeast Texas practiced a generally nomadic hunting and
gathering lifestyle throughout all of prehistory. While many of the same labels are used to denote
Southeast Texas cultural/chronological periods, the timeframe and cultural characteristics of
Southeast Texas culture periods are often different than in neighboring regions. For instance, the
Archaic and Late Prehistoric time periods are different in Central and Southeast Texas, and
Central Texas lacks the Early Ceramic period that has been defined for Southeast Texas.
Mobility and settlement patterns do not appear to have changed markedly through time in
Southeast Texas. Inland sites are usually found near a water source, usually exhibit evidence of
reoccupation through time, have well-defined intrasite activity areas, tend not to be associated
with satellite activity sites or separate base camps, and exhibit a range of subsistence-related
activities. Inland sites also tend to contain modest pottery assemblages, fired clay balls (at some
sites), abundant lithic material, and an absence of shell tools. Coastal sites tend to consist of
multicomponent Rangia shell middens that contain oyster shell tools, large quantities of pottery
(in later cultural components), numerous bone tools, and only a few lithic artifacts.

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (10,000 TO 5000 B.C.)

The initial human occupations in the New World can now be confidently extended back
before 10,000 B.C. (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990;

B879-1001.300

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans
were present in Eastern North America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al.
1990), while more recent discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for
human occupation in South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer
et al. 1997). Most archeologists presently discount claims of much earlier human occupation
during the Pleistocene glacial period.
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Southeast Texas is represented
by the PaleoIndian period (10,000 to 5000 B.C.) (Patterson 1995). This stage coincided with
ameliorating climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that witnessed the
extinction of herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing various periods
within this stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often fluted, lanceolate
projectile points. These points are frequently associated with spurred end-scrapers, gravers, and
bone foreshafts.
PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized into egalitarian bands
consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic subsistence and settlement
pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence patterns in Southeast Texas are
known primarily through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence focused on the exploitation of
small animals, fish, and shellfish, even during the PaleoIndian period. There is little evidence in
this region for hunting of extinct megafauna, as has been documented elsewhere in North
America; rather, a broad-based subsistence pattern appears to have been practiced during all
prehistoric time periods.
In Southeast Texas, the PaleoIndian stage is divided into two periods based on
recognizable differences in projectile point styles (Patterson 1995). These include the Early
PaleoIndian period (10,000 to 8000 B.C.), which is recognized based on large, fluted projectile
points (i.e., Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Big Sandy), and the Late PaleoIndian period
(8000 to 5000 B.C.), which is characterized by unfluted lanceolate points (i.e., Plainview,
Scottsbluff, Meserve, and Angostura).

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (5000 B.C. TO A.D. 100)

The onset of the Hypsithermal drying trend signaled the beginning of the Archaic stage
(5000 B.C. to A.D. 100) (Patterson 1995). This climatic trend marked the beginning of a
significant reorientation of lifestyle throughout most of North America, but this change was far less
pronounced in Southeast Texas. Elsewhere, the changing climatic conditions and corresponding
decrease in the big game populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a diversified
resource base composed of smaller game and wild plants. In Southeast Texas, however, this
hunting and gathering pattern is characteristic of most of prehistory. The appearance of a more
diversified tool kit, the development of an expanded groundstone assemblage, and a general
decrease in the size of projectile points are hallmarks of this cultural stage. Material culture shows
greater diversity during this broad cultural period, especially in the application of groundstone
technology.

Proposed Old Spanish Trail Roadway Improvements Project, Orange County, Texas

Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods. In
Southeast Texas, the Early Archaic period (5000 to 3000 B.C.) is marked by the presence of Bell,
Carrollton, Morrill, Trinity, Wells, and miscellaneous Early Stemmed projectile points. The Bell
point is the only type in this period that is closely associated with the Southern Plains. Many of
the latter point types continue into the Middle Archaic period (3000 to 1500 B.C.) and several new
types appear, including Bulverde, Lange, Pedernales, Williams, Travis, and probably the GaryKent series. The Late Archaic period (1500 B.C. to A.D. 100) is characterized by Gary, Kent,
Darl, Yarbrough, Ensor, Ellis, Fairland, Palmillas, and Marcos points.
In the western part of inland Southeast Texas, a Late Archaic mortuary tradition developed
in the lower Brazos and Colorado river valleys and in the intervening area (Hall 1981; Patterson
1995). Organized burial practices actually started during the Middle Archaic period but reached
full development in the Late Archaic with the use of exotic grave goods such as boatstones and
bannerstones (probably used as atlatl weights), stone gorgets, corner-tang knives, stingray
spines, shark teeth, and marine shell beads and pendants. Other burial practices included the
systematic orientation of burial direction, body position, use of red ochre, and use of locally made
grave goods, such as longbone implements and bone pins. Most burials are found in extended
supine position, though some extended prone and bundle burials are also known. Burial direction
is usually consistent within single sites but varies from site to site. Patterson et al. (1993) report
that at least 11 sites are associated with this mortuary tradition in Austin, Fort Bend, and Wharton
counties.

3.3

EARLY CERAMIC PERIOD (A.D. 100 TO 600)

The use of pottery did not start uniformly throughout Southeast Texas. Pottery
manufacture appears to have diffused into this region from adjacent regions, primarily from the
east along the coastal margin. Aten (1983:297) argues that pottery was being manufactured on
the coastal margin of the Texas-Louisiana border by about 70 B.C., in the Galveston Bay area by
about A.D. 100, in the western part of the coastal margin by about A.D. 300, and in the ConroeLivingston inland area by about A.D. 500. The practice of pottery manufacture appears to have
progressed first along the coastal margin and then moved inland (Patterson 1995). Southeastern
Texas ceramic chronologies are best known in the Galveston Bay area, where Aten (1983)
established a detailed chronological sequence.
The earliest ceramic periods in the Galveston Bay and neighboring Sabine Lake areas
appear to be approximately contemporaneous with the earliest ceramic periods of the lower
Mississippi Valley (Aten 1984). Early assemblages contain substantial quantities of Tchefuncte
ceramics. In the Sabine Lake region, grog-tempered varieties of Baytown Plain and Marksville
Stamped are common, while grog-tempered ceramics do not occur in the Galveston Bay area
128.7 kilometers (80.0 miles) to the west until several hundred years later. With the principal
exception of a few Tchefuncte ceramic types, other southern Louisiana ceramics are not found
on the Gulf coast west of the Sabine Lake area.
Goose Creek sandy-paste pottery was used throughout Southeast Texas and somewhat
farther north in the Early Ceramic, Late Prehistoric, and the early part of the Historic periods (Aten
1984; Patterson 1995; Pertulla et al. 1995). The Goose Creek series is the primary utility ware

B879-1001.300

15

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

throughout the prehistoric sequence in Southeast Texas, though it gives way to Baytown Plain for
about 200 years during the transition between the Late Prehistoric and Historic periods before
once again becoming predominant into the Historic period (Aten 1984). A minor variety, Goose
Creek Stamped, occurs only in the Early Ceramic period (Aten 1983). Three other minor pottery
types—Tchefuncte (Plain and Stamped), Mandeville, and O’Neal Plain variety Conway (Aten
1983)—were used only during the Early Ceramic period. The Mandeville and Tchefuncte types
are characterized by contorted paste and poor coil wedging. Mandeville has sandy paste (like
Goose Creek), while Tchefuncte paste has relatively little sand. Given their technological
similarities, Mandeville and Tchefuncte may represent different clay sources rather than distinct
pottery types (Patterson 1995). The bone-tempered pottery that characterizes ceramic
assemblages elsewhere in Texas is not common in Southeast Texas.

3.4

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 600 TO 1500)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period (A.D. 600 to 1500) (Patterson 1995) is defined by
the appearance of the bow and arrow. Elsewhere in Texas, pottery also appears during the latter
part of the Late Prehistoric period, but, as already discussed, ceramics appear earlier in Southeast
Texas. Along the coastal margin of Southeast Texas, use of the atlatl (i.e., spearthrower) and
spear was generally discontinued during the Late Prehistoric period, though they continued to be
used in the inland subregion along with the bow and arrow through the Late Prehistoric period
(Ensor and Carlson 1991; Keller and Weir 1979; Patterson 1980, 1995; Wheat 1953). In fact,
Patterson (1995:254) proposes that use of the bow and arrow started in Southeast Texas as early
as the end of the Middle Archaic period, using unifacial arrow points that consisted of marginally
retouched flakes. In contrast, Prewitt (1981) argues for a generalized date of adoption of the bowand-arrow hunting system at about the same time (ca. A.D. 600) in Central and Southeast Texas.
In Southeast Texas, unifacial arrow points appear to be associated with a small prismatic blade
technology. Bifacial arrow point types include Alba, Catahoula, Perdiz, and Scallorn. A serial
sequence for these point types has not been established in Southeast Texas, though Scallorn
points appear to predate Perdiz points throughout the rest of Texas.
Grog- (i.e., crushed-sherd-) tempered pottery was used in the Late Prehistoric and
Protohistoric periods in Southeast Texas. The grog-tempered varieties include San Jacinto Plain
and Baytown Plain variety Phoenix Lake. San Jacinto pottery contains a relatively small
proportion of small-sized temper, while Baytown Plain has larger amounts of sherd pieces that
are often visible on vessel surfaces. As previously mentioned, sandy-paste Goose Creek pottery
remained in use throughout the Late Prehistoric period. Rockport Plain and Asphalt Coated
pottery from the Central Texas Coast (Ricklis 1995) are found at a few sites in Southeast Texas
during the Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric periods.

3.5

PROTOHISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 1500 TO 1700)

For the most part, Protohistoric and early Historic Indian sites in Southeast Texas have
not been articulated with the ethnographic record (Story 1990:258). Similarly, reconciling the
ethnographic record to prehistoric Indian groups in this region is problematic. Late Prehistoric
and Historic population movements further complicate this issue. Aten (1983) has reconstructed

16

B879-1001_arch_survey_report

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey for the
Proposed Old Spanish Trail Roadway Improvements Project, Orange County, Texas

the territories of native groups present in this region in the early 18th century, including the
Akokisa, Atakapa, Bidai, Coco (possibly Karankawa), and Tonkawa. The presence of the
Tonkawa in Southeast Texas may be due to their rapid expansion from Central Texas in the 17th
and 18th centuries (Newcomb 1993:27). The Karankawa Indians are thought to have occupied
the coastal margin of this region as far east as Galveston Island and the corresponding mainland
(Aten 1983). Judging by the scarcity of Rockport pottery on sites east of the San Bernard River,
the ethnic association of the Karankawa Indians with the Coco tribe may be in doubt.
Protohistoric and Historic Indian sites may not be systematically recognized as such
because few aboriginal artifact types changed from the Late Prehistoric to the Historic periods
(Patterson 1995). Only a few non-European artifact types are useful in identifying Historic Indian
sites, including Bulbar Stemmed and Guerrero arrow points and possibly Fresno and Cuney
points after A.D. 1500 (Hudgins 1986). Historic period Indian sites are usually identified by the
presence of glass and metal artifacts, gunflints, and European types of pottery.

3.6

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. A.D. 1700 TO PRESENT)

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas occurred in 1519, when
Álvarez de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Álvar Núñez
Cabeza de Vaca crossed South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near
Galveston Bay; however, European settlement did not seriously disrupt native ways of life until
after 1700. The first half of the 18th century was the period in which the fur trade and mission
system, as well as the first effects of epidemic diseases, began to seriously disrupt the native
culture and social systems. This process is clearly discernable at the Mitchell Ridge site, where
the burial data suggest population declines and group mergers (Ricklis 1994), as well as
increased participation on the part of the Native American population in the fur trade. By the time
heavy settlement of Texas began in the early 1800s by Anglo-Americans, the indigenous Indian
population was greatly diminished. The Alabama/Coushatta Indians who currently reside in
Southeast Texas are migrants who were displaced from the east in the late 18th to early
19th centuries (Newcomb 1961).
Orange County was carved from Jefferson County on January 5, 1852, and its county seat
was located at Madison1. Confusion with Madisonville prompted the name change to Orange in
1858 at the time of the town’s incorporation. Orange had been known by a variety of names—
Strong’s Bluff, Huntley, Green’s Bluff, Jefferson, and Madison. Most sources cite the orange
grove planted by early settlers at the mouth of the Sabine River for explanation of the town’s
name. County growth centered on Orange. Because of its proximity to the Gulf and serving as
gateway to Texas and the West, the city quickly developed as both a maritime and cultural center.
Although only a small percentage of land was devoted to cotton farming, by 1861 over
20,000 bales of cotton were shipped from this growing port city. In 1857, the population was

1

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

1,277, including 282 slaves and 26 freed blacks. True to its predominantly southern majority,
Orange County voters supported the Democratic party in the elections just prior to the Civil War.
Orange County mustered several military units during the Civil War, including the Orange
Greys and the Orange Light Guard. A nearby naval encounter in 1863, the battle of Sabine Pass,
successfully halted the Union army’s advance into Texas. Orange survived the war intact but was
decimated only five months after the armistice, when a major hurricane hit the town on
September 13, 1865. The county population in 1870 dropped to 1,255. The Texas and New
Orleans Railroad, which had arrived in Orange in 1861 and then closed during the war, began
operating again in 1876. Also that year, Henry Jacob Lutcher and G. Bedell Moore visited Orange
from Pennsylvania and decided to open a sawmill and lumber plant. Lutcher moved to Orange
the following year and began operations. The opening of the Lutcher-Moore Lumber Company
began the slow but steady rebirth of the area. County population grew to 2,938 by 1880 as jobs
became available in lumber and related areas, including building construction and ship-building.
In 1881, C.P. Huntington brought the Southern Pacific to Orange, forming a direct route from San
Francisco to New Orleans. Orange became a major rail and port center. The Opelousas or Old
Spanish Trail crossed the Sabine only 16.1 kilometers (10.0 miles) north of the city. Cattle drives
frequently ended at the Orange terminals. Manufacturing became a major contributor to the local
economy as establishments increased from eight in 1880 to 27 in 1890, the largest percentage
increase on record. The Orange Rice Mill was formed in 1901. The Yell Mill (Equitable Bag), the
only mill in the world that used yellow pine shavings as a raw product, followed in 1904. That
year, county population was 5,905, and expectations for the future remained high, despite the
knowledge that the once abundant surrounding forests were becoming depleted. By 1900, most
religious groups were represented in the county. Catholics were there during the Spanish colonial
period, and Mexico required a pledge of Catholicism to obtain land grants, although most of the
early American arrivals to the area were at least nominally Protestant. According to a state census
of 1887, Baptist, Episcopal, Methodist, Presbyterian, and Catholic were all represented.
The discovery of oil at the Bland Well in 1913 and the Oscar Chesson Well in 1922
ushered in a new era and a new economy. The county grew to a record population high of 15,379
in 1920. That year, 32 manufacturers processed and refined oil in the county for a product total
of $17,154,779, compared with the 1900 value of $1,762,161. The number of employees at local
plants increased during this period from 894 in 1900 to 4,130. The Lutcher-Moore Lumber
Company donated land to the city of Orange in 1916 for port expansion. Both public and private
wharf space was improved and expanded. That year, the Sabine-Neches Waterway was dredged
through Sabine Lake past Sabine Pass to the Gulf of Mexico, and the Port of Orange attained
deep-water operations and invited the further expansion of oil operations and chemical industries.
The Great Depression marked a very difficult period for Orange County. The population
remained relatively stable (15,149 in 1930 to 17,382 in 1940), but industrial establishments
declined to 25 by 1930 and employed only 938 workers. By 1940, the figure had fallen further to
16 manufacturers and 527 employees. World War II and its defense needs led Orange County
to a recovery. Shipbuilding, long a local staple but moribund since 1918, reached new heights.
The population more than doubled to a record 40,567 in 1950, and manufacturing activity grew to
33 establishments employing 3,835 by 1947. DuPont moved to Orange in 1944 followed by Allied,

Spencer, Firestone, and Goodrich-Gulf, among other chemical and petrochemical manufacturers.
Farming and ranching played a diminishing role in the county’s economy. Farms produced
oranges and fruits, rice, Indian corn, oats, grass, cotton wool, peas and beans, potatoes, sweet
potatoes, soy beans, nursery stock, vegetables, and cattle. Crayfish, also raised commercially,
were featured during the annual Gumbo Cookoff held each May. Unlike many of its neighbors in
Texas and Louisiana, Orange County remained a bastion of Democratic strength throughout its
history. Presidential returns from 1968 to 1992 indicated a strong Democratic plurality, with only
the 1972 Nixon-McGovern election showing a GOP selection. The population of the county grew
from 40,567 in 1950 to 71,170 in 1970 and 83,838 in 1980 before declining slightly to 80,509 in
1990. County population centers with 1980 population figures include Orange (23,628), Vidor
(12,117), Bridge City (7,667), West Orange (4,610), and Pinehurst (3,055). Recreational facilities
include boating and fishing on Lake Sabine and the museums and historic homes of the city of
Orange.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Prior to initiating fieldwork, Horizon personnel reviewed the THC’s online Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) and Texas Historic Sites Atlas (THSA), the National Park
Service’s (NPS) online National Register Information System (NRIS), and the Texas Department
of Transportation’s (TxDOT) Historic Districts & Properties of Texas and Historic Bridges of Texas
online databases for information on previously recorded archeological sites and previous
archeological investigations conducted within a 1.6-kilometer (1.0-mile) radius of the project area.
Based on this archival research, one cemetery (the Mansfield Cemetery) is located within a 1.6kilometer (1.0-mile) radius of the project area (Table 2; Figure 5) (THC 2019; TxDOT 2019a,
2019b). The Mansfield Cemetery is located well outside of the project area and would not be
disturbed as a result of the proposed undertaking. No previous cultural resources surveys have
been conducted within or near the project area (THC 2019).
A review of historical aerial photographs dating from 1959 to the present and US
Geological Survey (USGS) topographic maps dating from 1926 to the present indicates that no
historic-age structures have stood within the project area since at least the early 20th century.
One structure, apparently a domicile, is depicted a short distance to the west of the project area
on USGS topographic maps dating from 1960 to 1991 and on aerial photographs dating from

1959 and 1970. The structure does not appear on subsequent maps, though modern aerial
imagery suggests there is a small farmstead at this location. Most of the buildings on this
farmstead appear to be modern.
At the request of the client, supplemental historical research was conducted focusing on
the potential relationship between the eponymously named Old Spanish Trail gravel road
proposed for expansion and the Old Spanish Trail National Highway or its historical predecessors,
such the El Camino Real de los Tejas, Opelousas Cattle Trail, Atascocita Road, or the Old
Spanish Trail. Presented as a stand-alone memorandum in Appendix B of this report, the
supplemental historical research concluded that the current gravel roadway does not appear to
be associated with any of the major roads or trails historically associated with this region.

5.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY

On April 19, 2019, Horizon archeologist Charles E. Bludau conducted an intensive cultural
resources survey of the project area. The survey was conducted under the overall direction of
Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator, under Texas Antiquities Permit no. 8874. The purpose
of the survey was to locate any significant cultural resources that potentially would be impacted
by the proposed undertaking. Horizon’s archeologist traversed the tract and thoroughly inspected
the modern ground surface for aboriginal and historic-age cultural resources. The existing ROW
of Old Spanish Trail consists of a two-lane gravel road with no shoulders. The proposed new
ROW to the east of the existing roadway consists of short-grass pastures. A large pond is present
to the southwest. Visibility of the modern ground surface was typically fair to good (30 to 60%)
(Figures 6 to 9).
In addition to pedestrian walkover, the Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey
Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile per 30.5-meter (100.0-foot)
width of proposed ROW or fraction thereof for linear projects. As such, a minimum of 16 shovel
tests would be required within the 0.8-kilometer- (0.5-mile-) long by 50.0-meter- (164.0-foot-) wide
project area. Horizon excavated a total of 17 shovel tests during the survey, thereby exceeding
the TSMASS requirements for a project area of this size (Figure 10). Shovel tests generally
measured 30.0 centimeters (11.8 inches) in diameter and were excavated to a target depth of
1.0 meter (3.3 feet) below surface, to the top of pre-Holocene deposits, or to the maximum depth
practicable. In practice, shovel tests were terminated at depths ranging from 50.0 to
100.0 centimeters (19.7 to 39.4 inches) below surface due to the presence of dense, sandy clay
sediments. All sediments were screened through 6.35-millimeter (mm) (0.25-inch) hardware
cloth. Standard shovel test logs were completed for each shovel test describing the location,
strata, soil texture and color, archeological materials (if present), and any unusual characteristics
of the surrounding landscape. All sediments excavated from shovel tests were replaced in the
shovel test hole upon completion of recording. The Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)
coordinates of each shovel test were determined using hand-held Garmin Foretrex or eTrex
Global Positioning System (GPS) devices using the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83).
Shovel testing typically revealed shallow to moderately deep deposits of sandy loam overlying
sandy clay at depths ranging from 5.0 to 60.0 centimeters (1.9 to 23.6 inches) below surface
(typically in the range of 30.0 to 60.0 centimeters [11.8 to 23.6 inches] below surface), though
deep sandy sediments were observed in two shovel tests extending to a depth of 1.0 meter
(3.3 feet) or more below surface. Sediments in a few than half of the shovel tests exhibited iron

staining, suggesting that the project area experiences at least seasonally, if not permanently, high
water tables. It is Horizon’s opinion that sediments with the potential to contain subsurface
archeological deposits were fully penetrated and that the project area was adequately assessed
for cultural resources. Specific shovel test data are summarized in Appendix A.
During the survey, field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, landforms,
survey methods, and shovel testing and backhoe trenching results. Digital photographs were
taken, and a photographic log was maintained. Horizon employed a non-collection policy for
cultural resources. Diagnostic artifacts (e.g., projectile points, ceramics, historic materials with
maker’s marks) and non-diagnostic artifacts (e.g., lithic debitage, burned rock, historic glass, and
metal scrap) were to be described, sketched, and/or photo-documented in the field and replaced
in the same location in which they were found. As no cultural materials were observed during the
survey, the collection policy was not brought into play.
The survey methods employed during the survey represented a “reasonable and goodfaith effort” to locate significant archeological sites within the project area as defined in 36 CFR
800.3.

7.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

7.1

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

The archeological investigations documented in this report were undertaken with three
primary management goals in mind:

•

Locate all historic and prehistoric archeological resources that occur within the
designated survey area.

•

Evaluate the significance of these resources regarding their potential for for
designation as SALs.

•

Formulate recommendations for the treatment of these resources based on their SAL
evaluations.

At the survey level of investigation, the principal research objective is to inventory the
cultural resources within the project area and to make preliminary determinations of whether or
not the resources meet one or more of the pre-defined eligibility criteria set forth in the state and/or
federal codes, as appropriate. Usually, management decisions regarding archeological
properties are a function of the potential importance of the sites in addressing defined research
needs, though historic-age sites may also be evaluated in terms of their association with important
historic events and/or personages. Under the Antiquities Code of Texas, archeological resources
are evaluated according to criteria established to determine the significance of archeological
resources for designation as SALs, respectively.
Analyses of the limited data obtained at the survey level are rarely sufficient to contribute
in a meaningful manner to defined research issues. The objective is rather to determine which
archeological sites could be most profitably investigated further in pursuance of regional,
methodological, or theoretical research questions. Therefore, adequate information on site
function, context, and chronological placement from archeological and, if appropriate, historical
perspectives is essential for archeological evaluations. Because research questions vary as a
function of geography and temporal period, determination of the site context and chronological
placement of cultural properties is a particularly important objective during the inventory process.

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR LISTING AS A STATE ANTIQUITIES LANDMARK

The criteria for determining the eligibility of a prehistoric or historic cultural property for
designation as an SAL are presented in Chapter 191, Subchapter D, Section 191.092 of the
Antiquities Code of Texas, which states that SALs include:
Sites, objects, buildings, artifacts, implements, and locations of historical, archeological,
scientific, or educational interest including those pertaining to prehistoric and historical
American Indians or aboriginal campsites, dwellings, and habitation sites, their artifacts
and implements of culture, as well as archeological sites of every character that are located
in, on, or under the surface of any land belonging to the State of Texas or to any county,
city, or political subdivision of the state are state antiquities landmarks and are eligible for
designation.

For the purposes of assessing the eligibility of a historic property for designation as an
SAL, a historic site, structure, or building has historical interest if the site, structure, or building:
1. [W]as the site of an event that has significance in the history of the United States or
the State of Texas;
2. [W]as significantly associated with the life of a famous person;
3. [W]as significantly associated with an event that symbolizes an important principle or
ideal;
4. [R]epresents a distinctive architectural type and has value as an example of a period,
style, or construction technique; or,
5. [I]s important as part of the heritage of a religious organization, ethic group, or local
society.

The Antiquities Code of Texas establishes the THC as the legal custodian of all cultural
resources, historic and prehistoric, within the public domain of the State of Texas. Under Part II
of Title 13 of the Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26), the THC may designate a historic
building, structure, cultural landscape, or non-archeological site, object, or district as an SAL if it
meets at least on one of following criteria:
A. [T]he property is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to
the broad patterns of our history, including importance to a particular cultural or ethnic
group;
B. [T]he property is associated with the lives of persons significant in our past;
C. [T]he property embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, represents the work of a master, possesses high artistic values, or
represents a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack
individual distinction;
D. [T]he property has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in Texas
culture or history.

Proposed Old Spanish Trail Roadway Improvements Project, Orange County, Texas

Furthermore, the THC may designate an archeological site as an SAL if the site meets
one or more of the following criteria:
1. [T]he site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory
and/or history of Texas by the addition of new and important information;
2. [T]he site’s archeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and
intact, thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;
3. [T]he site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or
history;
4. [T]he study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of
preservation, thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge; or,
5. [T]he high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur,
and official landmark designation is needed to ensure maximum legal protection, or
alternatively further investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and
relic collecting when the site cannot be protected.

SUMMARY OF INVENTORY RESULTS

On April 19, 2019, Horizon archeologist Charles E. Bludau conducted an intensive cultural
resources survey of the project area. The survey was conducted under the overall direction of
Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator, under Texas Antiquities Permit no. 8874. The purpose
of the survey was to locate any significant cultural resources that potentially would be impacted
by the proposed undertaking. Horizon’s archeologist traversed the tract and thoroughly inspected
the modern ground surface for aboriginal and historic-age cultural resources. The existing ROW
of Old Spanish Trail consists of a two-lane gravel road with no shoulders. The proposed new
ROW to the east of the existing roadway consists of short-grass pastures. A large pond is present
to the southwest. Visibility of the modern ground surface was typically fair to good (30 to 60%)
(Figures 6 to 9).
In addition to pedestrian walkover, the TSMASS require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per
mile per 30.5-meter (100.0-foot) width of proposed ROW or fraction thereof for linear projects. As
such, a minimum of 16 shovel tests would be required within the 0.8-kilometer- (0.5-mile-) long
by 50.0-meter- (164.0-foot-) wide project area. Horizon excavated a total of 17 shovel tests during
the survey, thereby exceeding the TSMASS requirements for a project area of this size. Shovel
testing typically revealed shallow to moderately deep deposits of sandy loam overlying sandy clay
at depths ranging from 5.0 to 60.0 centimeters (1.9 to 23.6 inches) below surface (typically in the
range of 30.0 to 60.0 centimeters [11.8 to 23.6 inches] below surface), though deep sandy
sediments were observed in two shovel tests extending to a depth of 1.0 meter (3.3 feet) or more
below surface. Sediments in a few than half of the shovel tests exhibited iron staining, suggesting
that the project area experiences at least seasonally, if not permanently, high water tables. It is
Horizon’s opinion that sediments with the potential to contain subsurface archeological deposits
were fully penetrated and that the project area was adequately assessed for cultural resources.
No cultural resources of historic or prehistoric age were observed on the modern ground
surface or within any of the shovel tests excavated within the project area during the survey.

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the results of the survey-level investigations documented in this report, no
potentially significant cultural resources would be affected by the proposed undertaking. In
accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, Horizon has made a reasonable and good-faith effort to identify
historic properties within the project area. No cultural resources were identified within the project
area that meet the criteria for designation as SALs according to 13 TAC 26 or for inclusion in the
NRHP under 36 CFR 60.4. Horizon recommends a finding of “no historic properties affected,”
and no further archeological work is recommended in connection with the proposed undertaking.
However, human burials, both prehistoric and historic, are protected under the Texas Health and
Safety Code. In the event that any human remains or burial objects are inadvertently discovered
at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance in the project area, even in
previously surveyed areas, all work should cease immediately in the vicinity of the inadvertent
discovery, and the Texas Historical Commission (THC) should be notified immediately.

Supplemental Historical Research

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey for the
Proposed Old Spanish Trail Roadway Improvements Project, Orange County, Texas

Supplemental Historical and Archival Research
Old Spanish Trail Roadway Improvements Project
Orange County, Texas
By Eugene Foster
The Orange County Road and Bridge Department is proposing to relocate/expand a
853.4-meter-(2,800.0-foot-) long segment of county-owned roadway known as Old Spanish Trail
(OST) in western Orange County, approximately 2.4 kilometers (1.5 miles) east of Rose City and
3.2 kilometers (2.0 miles) south-southeast of Vidor, Texas (Figure B-1). The subject portion of
the current OST roadway meanders along the northeastern bank of a man-made lake that is
eroding at a rate sufficient to threaten the long-term stability of the public roadway. The county’s
proposed relocationexpansion project would be designed and constructed entirely with local bond
funding with LJA Engineering, Inc. (LJA) providing professional engineering design services and
Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) providing environmental permitting support. The
goal of Horizon’s archival research was to confirm whether the current OST roadway is or was
directly associated with The Old Spanish Trail National Highway or its historical predecessors,
the Old Spanish Trail, Atascosita-Opelousas Road, or the La Bahia route of El Camino Real de
los Tejas. This memorandum documents Horizon’s research results, assessments, and
recommendations based on its interpretation of the archival data obtained from primary and
secondary source documents.
Horizon’s research approach initially focused on Orange County real property records,
specifically real property records for three tracts encompassing the current OST roadway.
Horizon reviewed the deed and plat records as well as surveyor’s metes-and-bounds descriptions
for those property tracts, searching for references to older roadways that may correlate with the
current OST roadway. Horizon extended its property history research to include Spanish-era,
Mexican-era, and Republic of Texas-era property records archived at the Texas General Land
Office (GLO). A second line of research focused on historical maps illustrating the routes of roads,
trails, and highways passing near the project vicinity from the Spanish Colonial era to the present.
A third line of research focused on the Old Spanish Trail National Highway, its origins, and its
geographic relationship to the current OST roadway.
Briefly summarized, the current OST roadway alignment does not appear to correlate
directly with any of several major roads and trails historically associated with Orange County and
the project vicinity. Instead, the current OST roadway appears to have originated as part of a
peripheral network of unimproved roads and trails that branched from or crossed the primary eastto-west oriented roadway known variously over time as the Old Spanish Trail National Highway,
the Old Spanish Trail, the Atascosita-Opelousas Road, and the La Bahia Road or lower route of
El Camino Real de los Tejas. A wide variety of historical sources and maps from the Spanish
Colonial era to the 20th century identify a major east-to-west trail or road located north of the
current OST project area. The earliest records identify the road as the Opelousas Road, an
eastward extension of the Atascosita Road. French Colonial traders, Spanish Colonial
missionaries, and subsequent American colonists continued using the old trail or road that
crossed the Neches at Tevis Bluff (later Beaumont) on its way to Ballou’s Ferry on the Sabine
River. Over time, the Opelousas Road became known as the old Spanish Trail, which provided

the conceptual basis for an early nation-wide automotive highway—the Old Spanish Trail or
Southern National Highway. A variety of sources provide more specific evidence of the current
OST roadway as early as 1838, when the county surveyor recorded the Road to Jasper along the
northern boundary of the Gilbert Stephenson Survey at or near the current OST roadway crossing,
with subsequent maps of the area showing local roads crossing the Texas and New Orleans
Railroad on their way south around G. Stephenson’s swamp tracts on the way to places like
Duncans Woods and the Mansfield Ferry on the east bank of the Neches River.
Historical Background
Prehistory—Findings of Clovis points and spearheads provide evidence that the area
was occupied 12,000 to 15,000 years ago. By the historic-contact period, Native Americans in
the area were Atakapan Indians. These early inhabitants left shell remains of houses and burial
mounds. Much evidence has been gleaned from these sources indicating a hunting, gathering,
and fishing culture. By the late 19th century, little besides their mounds remained, and by 1908
the population had dwindled to nine known Atakapans in the area (TSHA 2019d). Figure B-2
depicts the Atakapan Tribes east of Orcoquisac on the Trinity River and a major trail crossing the
Neches and Sabine rivers on the way to the Opelousas territory in Louisiana.
European Colonial Era—The coastal region that includes the project area was highly
contested during European colonization of the New World. Alonso Álvarez de Pineda came to
the area under the Spanish flag in 1519 to map the coastline. He named the Sabine River (San
Francisco de Sabenas) after the cypress trees he found. Between 1685 and 1687, René Robert
Cavalier, Sieur de La Salle’s ill-fated expedition in search of the Mississippi River ended with

LaSalle falling victim to hostility within his own party somewhere east of the Trinity River, possibly
as far east as the Neches River (Stratton 1925; TSHA 2019c).
To address the French incursions, the Spanish established a number of missions
throughout the region. By 1718, numerous French traders had crossed the Sabine and were
freely operating in the region. Relations were generally peaceful, and France ceded the area to
Spain in 1763 at the Treaty of Paris. Louisiana was returned to Napoleon in 1800, and he
promptly resold it to the US in 1803. Thereafter, border disputes between Spain and the US
continued until the Adams-Onís Treaty was signed in 1819, fixing the western border of the US
at the mouth of the Sabine River (TSHA 2019d).
Movement through the region generally followed well established trails and roads dating
from prehistoric times. The La Bahía Road, also known as Lower Road (meaning the lower major
branch of the El Camino Real de los Tejas) was originally an east-to-west Indian trail that
connected Atakapan or Akokisa villages in southeastern Texas to the Opelousas settlement in
southwestern Louisiana during prehistoric times. The portion of the road west of the Neches
River was identified by the Spanish and subsequent Mexican Republic-era colonists as the
Atascosita Road. The eastern extension of that trail extended into southwestern Louisiana and
was known as the Opelousas Road. This early historic-period route was presumably known as
early as 1690, when it was traveled by Alonso De León (TSHA 2019c). Most historical accounts
agree that the Opelousas Road, later called the Old Spanish Trail, extended from Beaumont
(formerly Tevis Bluff) on the Neches River to Ballou’s ferry crossing on the Sabine River about
16.1 kilometers (10.0 miles) north of present-day Orange, Texas (TSHA 2019b).
Republic of Mexico Era—Seeking to populate the area, the newly established Republic
of Mexico sought to increase settlement in the region by appointing empresarios, such as Stephen
F. Austin and Lorenzo de Zavala, who were authorized by the Mexican State of Coahuila and
Texas to award generous land grants to immigrant Anglo-American and other European settlers.
Lorenzo de Zavala was authorized in 1829 to settle 500 families on a large tract of land between
the lower Sabine and Neches rivers. A number of early Republic of Mexico-era land grants were
issued to incoming settlers from de Zavala’s headquarters in Nacogdoches before he transferred
his interest in the grants to the Galveston Bay and Texas Land Company in 1830. Among those
Mexican-era land grants was a one-half league tract, approximately 896.0 hectares
(2,214.0 acres), granted to Noah Tevis along the Neches River in 1835. The settlement was then
called Tevis Bluff and later became the town of Beaumont (Stratton 1925).
Figures B-3 and B-4 show the Atascosita Road west of “Tivis’s ferry” on the Neches River
and the “Camino a las Opelousas,” or Opelousas Road, extending east from the Neches River
into Louisiana. Figure B-5, published in 1834, shows Lorenzo de Zavalla’s Mexican Republic-era
colony boundaries between the Neches and Sabine rivers. Figure B-6, published just a few years
later, shows the original boundaries of Jefferson County as it was established under the Republic
of Texas in 1837 and before Orange County was created in 1852. The “Altascasetto Road” is
shown on this map crossing the Neches River at “Tivis” ferry on its way eastward to Ballou’s Ferry
on the Sabine River.
Republic of Texas Era—Beaumont was incorporated as a town on December 16, 1838,
and its first elected officials were sworn into office on August 8, 1840. In 1839, the members of
the town site company—Nancy Tevis, Joseph Grigsby, and the Pulsifer Company—subdivided

the town, designating the personal property of each of the three members in the deed of partition.
Additionally, certain tracts of land were designated for “public roads and commons,” with the
partition deed stating:
And the said parties of the three parts do hereby covenant and agree that all streets,
commons, lots of ground within the limits of the said town of Beaumont…are hereby given,
granted, released and forever quitclaimed into the corporation of the town of
Beaumont…for the purposes of said streets, highways, and commons of said town and
shall be forever kept open for the free use of the citizens thereof (Stratton 1925).

Figure B-7 shows Beaumont at the juncture of four roadways within Noah Tevis’ grant,
one of which crosses the Neches River at Tevis’ Ferry and extends east through Gilbert
Stephenson’s land grant. As the only major road crossing the Neches River from Beaumont, this
route seems to correlate well with the roadway identified more than a century earlier by Stephen
F. Austin and others as the Atascosita-Opelousas Road.
American-era—As described by historian W.T. Block, the Opelousas Trail retraced or ran
parallel to the Old Spanish Trail and was used as a trail for cattle drives as early as 1779 when

Francisco Garcia left San Antonio with 2,000 steers bound for beef-hungry New Orleans (Block
1975). By 1861, the Texas and New Orleans (T&NO) Railroad arrived, connecting Beaumont to
New Orleans. Though the T&NO Railroad ceased operations during the Civil War, Beaumont on
the Atascosito-Opelousas Road or Old Spanish Trail continued to serve as a major waypoint for
cattle drives from Texas to New Orleans. After the war, the T&NO Railroad resumed operations
and Beaumont’s history as a cattle town faded away.
By 1881, the Southern Pacific Railroad acquired and integrated the former T&NO Railroad
into its nationwide railway from San Francisco to New Orleans. By 1897, the Kansas City
Southern Railroad also extended its system to Beaumont. Figures B-8 and B-9 illustrate the eastto-west route of the T&NO/Southern Pacific Railroad through the “Stevenson” (sic) survey and
the Kansas City Southern Railroad branching to the northeast.
As automotive transportation technology and roadways developed across the nation in the
early 20th century, the Good Roads movement promoted much needed improvement and
expansion of the nation’s automotive highways. Among the earliest national-scale highway
projects was the Old Spanish Trail or Southern National Highway. The Old Spanish Trail Highway
was envisioned by the Old Spanish Trail Association in 1915 as a southern transcontinental
highway. In 1919, the group established headquarters at the Gunter Hotel in San Antonio. By
1929, the highway was completed, running from St. Augustine, Florida, across the southern US
to San Diego, California. The Texas portion of the road began at the southwestern Louisiana
border near Orange and passed through Beaumont, Houston, and San Antonio on its route to El
Paso (Figure B-10). The Old Spanish Trail Association publicized the route to local communities
and tourists and had distributed 83,000 maps and travel service booklets by August 1926 (THC
2019).

proposed Old Spanish Trail project area.
However, the use of named highways was sometimes confusing, prompting the Texas
Highway Commission to adopt a numbered system for its state highways. For example, the

highway route known as the Old Spanish Trail/Southern National Highway from Beaumont to
Orange did not follow the similarly named route of the Old San Antonio Road from San Antonio
to Nacogdoches (TSHA 2019a). As a numbered highway, the Old Spanish Trail/Southern
National Highway was first designated State Highway (SH) 3 but was later renamed SH 27 and
again later as SH 90.
Figure B-10 shows the primary route of the Old Spanish Trail Highway between Orange
and Beaumont circa 1930 as well as a lateral branch from Beaumont to Port Arthur along the
western side of the Neches River. Notably, no similar branches are shown along the eastern side
of the Neches River in the vicinity of the current OST roadway project area.
The Texas GLO maintains original documents documenting Gilbert Stephenson’s arrival
in Texas in 1828, his award of 1st-Class Headright Certificate No. 64, an 1834 order to survey
Stephenson’s grant, the surveyor’s field notes, and the date his grant was finally patented on 11
December 1841 (Figure B-11). The survey order refers to a sitio (one league) of land in Zavala’s
Grant to be selected by Gilbert Stephenson. As selected by Stephenson and surveyed by
Benjamin Hart in 1838, the Gilbert Stephenson survey was laid out as a long lot fronting on the
east bank of the Neches River and extending eastward toward the Sabine River. Hart’s Field
Notes of 1838 refer to an intersection with the “Jasper Road” along the Gilbert Stephenson’s
northern boundary, 3202 varas (8,894.5 feet) west of the northeastern corner of Gilbert
Stephenson’s league (Figure B-12). Correlation of current the GLO’s GIS Map Viewer (GLO
2019) and Google Earth’s January 2018 imagery places the northeastern corner of the G.
Stephenson Survey, as indicated on Figure B-13, and the current “Old Spanish Trail”
2,713.0 meters (8,901.0 feet) west along G. Stephenson’s northern boundary line, within
approximately 3.0 meters (10.0 feet) of Hart’s 1838 field note reference to the Jasper Road
intersection.

Following Gilbert Stephenson’s death in 1882, his original land grant was divided into two
sets of seven subdivided tracts, with one set designated as the “dry” or “high” tracts and the other
set as the “swamp” tracts (Figure B-14). Among Gilbert Stephenson’s many heirs, his daughter
Louisa Adcock received Division 3 of the Stephenson Estate swamp tracts (OROPR, Vol. H,
page 375), a 91.5-hectare (226.0-acre) tract that encompasses the current OST project area. By
1932, a meandering, unimproved roadway is depicted on the US Geological Survey (USGS)
Beaumont, Texas, 1:62,000 topographic quadrangle at a location that correlates in part with the
alignment of the current OST roadway (Figure B-15). An unimproved road that correlates with
the current OST roadway is depicted on a 1961 Tobin Property ownership map within N.N.
Adcock’s 91.5-hectare (226.0-acre) tract (Figure B-16). Google Earth’s 2018 aerial photo imagery
(Figure B-17) indicates that a large lake has been created along the southwestern edge of the
OST roadway in recent years, while the remainder of Louisa Adcock’s 91.5-hectare (226.0-acre)
swamp tract appears to have remained in agricultural use for more than 100 years. Current
Orange County tax appraisal district records (Figure B-18) indicate that Adcock’s portion of her
father’s original land has remained largely intact with only limited subdivision of the property
among a few apparently related heirs of the Davis family.

Conclusions and Recommendations
Horizon’s archival research into the history of the proposed OST roadway
relocation/expansion project included examination of official archival records, library special
collections, and a wide variety of historical maps and aerial photographs. The information sources
cited in this report provided information related to the initial question raised by the project sponsor:
Is the current OST roadway part of the Old Spanish Trail and/or the more recent Old Spanish Trail
Highway system? Though documentary sources identify the “Old Spanish Trail” under a variety
of names, they consistently locate it on an east-to-west alignment connecting Beaumont
(previously Tevis’ bluff or Tevis’ ferry) on the Neches River to a ferry crossing on the Sabine River
most often referred to as Ballou’s Ferry. All cartographic depictions of the “Old Spanish Trail”
place it north of the Texas and New Orleans/Southern Pacific Railroad and therefore north of the
current OST roadway relocation/expansion project area.
As transportation technology evolved beyond railroads and toward automobiles, the route
of the “Old Spanish Trail” of the 18th and 19th centuries was adopted as the conceptual basis for
an Old Spanish Trail Highway in the early 20th century. The Old Spanish Trail Association
publicized maps showing the main route as well as lateral connecting roads comprising what they
called the Old Spanish Trail System of Highways rather than a single route. All evidence reviewed
by Horizon places the main route of the Old Spanish Trail north of the T&NO Railroad and north
of the current OST road relocation/expansion project. The only lateral branch from the main route
is a roadway connecting Beaumont to the Port Arthur area along the western bank of the Neches

River. No evidence was found indicating that a branch of the Old Spanish Trail Highway ever
extended along the eastern bank of the Neches River in the OST roadway project vicinity.
Certain records, however, did provide evidence of other old, unnamed roads or trails
extending into the OST roadway project vicinity. As early as 1838, surveyor’s field notes for the
Gilbert Stephenson survey recorded an intersection with the “Jasper Road” at a location that
correlates well with the current OST roadway but well to the north of the current project area (see
Figure B-13). Between 1901 and 1961, a series of maps were found showing several unimproved
and unnamed roads or trails following various alignments that generally passed near or along the
route of the current OST roadway (see Figures B-8, B-9. B-15, and B-16). Though it remains
unclear whether the 1838 Jasper Road extended into the current OST roadway
relocation/expansion project vicinity, it is clear that a variety of unimproved local roads and trails
have passed though the project vicinity over time, probably to provide access to settlements and
ferries located farther south along the eastern bank of the Neches River.
