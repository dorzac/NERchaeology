ABSTRACT

In 2007, the Texas Facilities Commission began a Deferred Maintenance Project to make
improvements to the aging building and infrastructure of the Texas Governor’s Mansion (41TV1872).
The mansion was built between 1854 and 1856, and this project is only the most recent of many
projects involving facilities maintenance, infrastructure upgrades, or major renovations. Deferred
Maintenance construction activities began in January 2008, and Prewitt and Associates archeologists
monitored work in all areas where mechanical or hand digging was done to replace buried sewer
and water lines and to expand the basement. Fifteen historic features were discovered and
documented, including remnants of landscaping features and walkways, a section of brick wall from
the 1856 basement stairway, a brick wall foundation for the 1856 porch, and a brick-walled grease
trap from the late nineteenth or early twentieth century. The most significant features found during
the monitoring project are two fully intact, brick-lined cisterns. The east wall of a large cistern was
found below the 1914 concrete wall foundation. This West Cistern is believed to be the original 1856
cistern, and it held at least 7,100 gallons of water. The North Cistern was found in the lawn north of
the 1914 addition, but it is much smaller and held an estimated 1,400–1,500 gallons of water. It was
built sometime before 1888, and quite possibly in the early 1870s, when the first indoor toilets were
installed at the mansion. After thorough documentation, both cisterns were reburied and are
preserved in place. A ground-penetrating radar survey was conducted in the south lawn, and the
data may indicate the location of an 1856 privy pit.

CURATION

During the 2008 archeological investigations, artifacts were collected from various
construction excavation areas. In some areas, all artifacts were collected for analysis, while only
samples were collected in other areas. In addition, samples of mortar, plaster, and sediment were
collected for analysis. All project records and selected artifats and samples will be permanently
curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, University of Texas at Austin.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

The archeological investigations at the Texas Governor’s Mansion for the Deferred
Maintenance Project were complicated because there were so many agencies and individuals involved.
The overall project was overseen by the Texas Facilities Commission (TFC), and Prewitt and
Associates was a second-tier subcontractor under an agreement with Terracon Consultants, Inc., of
Austin. Darrel Wallace (TFC project manager) and David Pickett (Terracon project manager) were
our primary contacts. Onsite we worked under the supervision of Braun and Butler Construction,
and our key contacts were Brandon Currey (assistant project manager) and Rick Garner (site
superintendent). Mr. Currey and Mr. Garner were especially helpful and supportive of our work
throughout the project.
The daily archeological monitoring activities were primarily related to excavations conducted
by two construction crews: Mid-State Plumbing, Inc., for exterior plumbing excavations; and Lehne
Construction Company, for the basement expansion excavations. Members of both groups worked
closely with us during the course of the project. The plumbing crew from Mid-State included foreman
Hiram Huett, his apprentice Patrick Finn, and David Kreinbrink, Joey Rivera, Jaime (J.B.) Falcón,
Tel Burk, Josh Thornhill, Kelly Gray, David Gray, and Brandon Lee. Randy Gorton oversaw the
Lehne Construction crew. Others who assisted PAI in some way during the archeological monitoring
are Randy Wells (Susman Tisdale and Gayle, Architects), Mike McDonald (HMG and Associates,
Inc.), and Jack Tyler (Mid-State Plumbing, Inc.).
Tiffany Osburn and Bill Pierson of the Texas Historical Commission conducted the groundpenetrating radar survey in the south lawn, and this effort provides additional evidence regarding
a possible privy located there. Although this survey area was not impacted by this project, the
survey is an important contribution to our knowledge of the Governor’s Mansion. Osburn’s efficiency
and expertise in conducting the GPR survey and interpreting the data are greatly appreciated.
The historical resources on the mansion property are overseen by two state preservation
agencies. For the Texas State Preservation Board (TSPB), Lee Baker and Sherry Allsup were our
main contacts. Ms. Allsup (project manager and architect) provided us on several occasions with
critical information pertaining to previous improvement projects at the mansion. Our archeological
work was done under authority of a Texas Antiquities Permit, and the Texas Historical Commission
reviewed all of the PAI work on the mansion grounds. Several people involved in the Governor’s
Mansion project visited the site on different occasions, including Lawerence Oaks (executive
directory), James Bruseth (Archeology Division director), Mark Denton and Bill Martin (Archeology
Division), Stan Graves (Architecture Division director), and Brad Patterson (Architecture Division).
The Archeology Division staff responded quickly and visited the site on many occasions to examine
features that were discovered during monitoring. Special thanks to Mr. Denton for his many site
visits, his oversight of our work, and for sharing his knowledge of historic bricks and cisterns.
Ellen Read, with the Office of Governor Rick Perry, was very cooperative and helped us in
many ways. She gave us access to published documents and connected us to the best sources each
time we had questions about the mansion’s past. Her help throughout the project is greatly
appreciated. Liz Geise, also with the governor’s office, assisted us in our research efforts as well.
Hector Medrano, maintenance supervisor for the Governor’s Mansion grounds, shared his extensive
knowledge with us. His excellent memory of where utility lines, manholes, and water sprinkler lines
were located proved very helpful. The archeological findings generated interest among the governor’s
office and mansion staff, and even Governor Rick Perry and First Lady Anita Perry visited the
mansion on one occasion to see the original brick-walled cistern that was found during the basement
expansion.

The folks at Volz and Associates, Inc., in Austin were very helpful. John Volz and Tere
O’Connell shared their extensive knowledge of the mansion’s history. Along with Chris Hutson and
Tracy Hirschman, they responded to our many requests for information and provided us with historic
architectural drawings and photographs that were critical to our work.
For Prewitt and Associates, most of the archeological monitoring was done by Jenny
McWilliams, and Doug Boyd assisted in some monitoring and when documentation of archeological
features required more than one person. Elaine Robbins edited the draft report, and Sandy Hannum
and Brian Wootan produced the figures.
To all of the people listed above, and to any others we may have forgotten—thank you!

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND

1

designed to meet those goals. Plans were made
to replace, repair, and expand the infrastructure
to update the 152-year-old building to modern
safety standards and building codes. Because
the project would involve subsurface excavations
outside the mansion and in the proposed base­
ment expansion area, archeological monitoring
was required under provisions of the Antiqui­
ties Code of Texas.
After negotiations with the Texas Facilities
Commission, Terracon, Inc., subcontracted the
archeological monitoring to PAI. The work en­
tailed monitoring all subsurface excavations at
the mansion and immediately investigating any
historical remains that were found. PAI was just
one of many state agencies, contractors, and
subcontractors that played some role in the ar­
cheological investigations (see Chapter 2). The
Texas Historical Commission was the most di­
rectly involved; it reviewed all aspects of the
archeological monitoring and historic feature
investigations.
PAI participated in onsite planning meet­
ings in January and February 2008 and then
conducted periodic archeological monitoring and
feature investigations at the mansion from
March through May. PAI worked closely with
various construction contractors and subcon­
tractors to coordinate the monitoring work with
construction activities. PAI conducted its last
fieldwork on May 27. By this time, most of the
renovation work that involved earthmoving and
archeological monitoring had been completed.
The only tasks remaining that would require
archeological monitoring were minor excava­
tions in the south lawn, which were tentatively
scheduled to happen in June. On the night of
June 8, 2008, an arsonist started a fire on the
second floor of the Governor’s Mansion. The

In 2007, yet another series of renovations
began at the Texas Governor’s Mansion in Aus­
tin. During the construction phase in 2008,
Prewitt and Associates, Inc. (PAI), conducted
archeological monitoring to identify and docu­
ment historic resources associated with the
mansion. The investigations, which are de­
scribed in this report, were completed as part of
the Deferred Maintenance Project initiated by
the Texas Facilities Commission in 2007.Accord­
ing to the Texas Facilities Commission website
(2008a), the Deferred Maintenance Program
was created to:
1. Repair or replace broken critical building
systems that have exceeded their life
expectancy and to avoid liabilities
associated with life-safety or federally
mandated compliance programs and
disruption of vital government operations;
2. Eliminate any deferred maintenance by
upgrading buildings and equipment to
lower maintenance cost and liabilities;
3. Upgrade building systems to increase
current building capacities such as the
153 Rule that allows more employees per
square foot to be housed in state-owned
office buildings, and;
4.

Improve performance levels consistent
with industry standards through
installation of high efficiency equipment
with new technology to lower utility costs
and maintain realistic preventive
maintenance practices.

The Deferred Maintenance Project, a long
overdue initiative, included major renovations

structure sustained extensive damages, and all
work on the Deferred Maintenance Project was
halted. Once the arson investigations were com­
pleted, the efforts of the Deferred Maintenance
Project were shifted to cleaning up and stabiliz­
ing the mansion, evaluating the structural in­
tegrity of the building, and planning the
restoration work. Restoration fundraising has
begun, and the long task of restoring the his­
toric Governor’s Mansion is currently underway
(Perry 2008).

investigating one feature that was discovered
during the renovation project. The historic fea­
ture was a brick-lined privy pit that was pre­
sumably built when the mansion was
constructed in 1854–1856. Careful hand exca­
vations were done to expose and document the
feature, a portion of which remains intact be­
neath the pavement in front of the carriage
house (see Blake and Kibler 1999:Figure 7). The
privy walls were three bricks wide (about 12
inches) with the bricks laid in a stretcher bond
pattern with sandy mortar. The feature is con­
structed entirely of Austin common bricks that
have a frog (recessed panel) on one face.
Based on the historical and archeological
research, Blake and Kibler (1999) documented
the locations of several important historical fea­
tures on the mansion grounds. Figures 1.1 and
1.2 (reproduced from Figures 1 and 2 in Blake
and Kibler 1999) show the location of the ca.
1856 privy and other historic features that were
once present on the mansion grounds. The 1912
photograph in Figure 1.2 is particularly infor­
mative because it shows how the back of the
mansion looked immediately before the exten­
sive 1914 renovations.
Since 1999, no archeological studies have
been conducted at the mansion until PAI was
contracted to do the archeological monitoring
for the Deferred Maintenance Project. The re­
mainder of this report relates to the historic and
archeological studies completed in 2008 in con­
junction with this project.

SITE LOCATION AND SETTING
The Texas Governor’s Mansion is in down­
town Austin, southwest of the State Capitol. The
mansion and grounds, recorded as archeologi­
cal site 41TV1872, occupy the whole city block
between Colorado and Lavaca and 10th and
11th Streets. The mansion sits on an old allu­
vial terrace of the Colorado River, some 25 m
above the river, a landform that Rodda (1970:7)
termed the Capitol Terrace. The terrace consists
of a thick (9–10-m) layer of gravel, sand, and
clay set into Upper Cretaceous Austin Chalk.
Previous archeological work at the mansion
(Blake and Kibler 1999), as well as the archeo­
logical work reported here, confirm that the
mansion sits on a high knoll that has a thin cap
of dark loamy topsoil underlain by a dense de­
posit of ancient Colorado River gravels. The
lower alluvium “consists of highly rubified
(2.5YR 4/4 reddish brown grading to 2.5Y 5/3
light olive brown), very gravelly sandy clay, with
more resistant cherts and quartzites compris­
ing the bulk of the gravel population” (Blake and
Kibler 1999:8).

HISTORICAL OVERVIEW
A comprehensive history of the Texas
Governor’s Mansion is not possible here, nor is
one necessary for interpreting the archeologi­
cal remains found during the 2008 Deferred
Maintenance Project. This brief summary fo­
cuses on the aspects of the mansion’s history
that have a bearing on the archeological remains
that were found or that one might expect to find.
The historical “bible” for this project is a
book called The Texas Governor’s Mansion, writ­
ten by Jean Daniel, Price Daniel, and Dorothy
Blodgett and published in 1984. Price Daniel
served as governor from 1957 to 1963, but it was
First Lady Jean Houston Daniel who spear­
headed the research effort that led to the publi­
cation of the book. From the 1960s to 1984, Jean
Daniel and Dorothy Blodgett compiled a mas­

PREVIOUS HISTORIC
ARCHEOLOGICAL
INVESTIGATIONS
In 1998–1999, PAI personnel conducted the
first archeological investigations on the grounds
of the Governor’s Mansion. The historical and
archeological investigations were conducted in
conjunction with planned restoration and reno­
vation work (Blake and Kibler 1999). PAI sub­
contracted through Volz and Associates, Inc., of
Austin, to perform the work for the Texas Gen­
eral Services Commission. The field effort in­
volved periodic monitoring of trench
excavations. The archeologists spent some time

sive research collection of records that pertain
to the history of the mansion. These records are
now housed at the Texas State Library and Archives in Austin, and a summary of them is
available online (Texas State Library and Archives Commission 2008). The book contains

many interesting facts that illuminate the history of the mansion and property. Because so
few records of previous work have been compiled
or organized, this book was the best single reference on previous alterations to the mansion
and grounds. From an archeological perspective,

ated using only published references. It relies
heavily on Daniel et al. (1984) but also incorpo­
rates many important legislative appropriations
identified in Gammell’s The Laws of Texas (1898,
1904, 1913, 1915) and a few other sources. Al­
though it is by no means comprehensive, this chro­
nology helped us identify and date many of the
features encountered.
Improvements to the Texas Governor’s Man­
sion in the nineteenth century reflected the lat­
est innovations in home technology. Significant
additions and renovations occurred in the 1870s,
when gas lights and the mansion’s first indoor
toilets, probably self-contained systems, were
installed. In the 1880s, Austin’s first city water
system appeared, and water was piped into the
mansion. Indoor plumbing and telephones also
appeared. (A city sewer system probably did not

its most important contribution is that it iden­
tifies the major periods of renovation, provid­
ing valuable information about when various
structures or features were removed or altered
and clues to when others were abandoned and
forgotten.
In an appendix to The Texas Governor’s Man­
sion, Daniel et al. (1984) presented a brief table
called “Structural Changes 1859–1983,” which is
reproduced here (Table 1.1). Although this chro­
nology proved useful for the current project, the
archeologists found it necessary as the work pro­
gressed to compile a more detailed chronological
listing (Table 1.2). This expanded chronology fo­
cused on historical events in which improvements
were made to the mansion or grounds. Since no
provisions were made to do archival research us­
ing primary documents, this chronology was cre­

Event
On February 16, 1848, a joint resolution was passed authorizing the Comptroller of Public Accounts to provide a
residence in the City of Austin for the use of the Governor of the State.
On February 11, funding was approved for the erection of a “Residence and Out Buildings” with $14,500 allotted to
1854
the structures and an additional $2,500 for furnishings.
An act approved on January 12, 1860, provided further appropriations of $1,000. An artisian well was bored on the
1860
Capitol Square.
In February 1856, Pease, Raymond, and Shaw wrote to Abner Cook “in regard to the slow progress made with the
1856
work.” They had found that “nothing had been done with the cistern or the cellar” and threatened that unless the
cistern was cleaned and cemented...” they would hire someone else to do the work.
“[Pease’s] first night in the Mansion was June 10 [1856], and he wrote the next day [to his wife] that he found the
1856
house much cooler than the old one” and that “the cistern water is excellent, quite equal to the big cistern which
you know is the best in town.” In August, he added that he had “a good supply of water, and the coolest house in
town.”
On September 2, 1856, neighboring landowner Joseph Harrell wrote a letter of complaint to the legislature about
1856
the location of the privy across from his front door. Harrell paid $125 to have the privy moved and was later
reimbursed.
Same repairs needed as listed in 11th Legislature were duplicated for the 12th Legislature; in an act approved
1870
August 15, 1870, by the 12th Legislature, $5,00 was appropriated for same repairs “and additions” [probably refers
to furniture, not buildings]. Roof repairs were done in October 1870 and a lightning rod was installed; 35 pages of
bills from August to December 1870 outline the following repairs: “installation of the first modern toilet;
construction of a garden house; extensive landscaping, including fruit trees, shrubs, flowers, and vegetables;
structural additions and repairs; four tiled hearths; plastering, flooring, painting, molding, and carpeting; and
window panes in one or more rooms.”
ca. 1870s “Prior to the establishment of waterworks in the 1870s, Brown’s Annals records that Austin residents used
cisterns, as did the Mansion occupants, or they bought water from the Colorado River for twenty-five cents per
barrel. Horse-drawn carts hauled whisky barrels full of water throughout the city.”
A new door “listed in the purchase vouchers may have been for a garden house which was probably built along with
1870–
a gazebo. Both appear in photographs taken a few years later.”
1871
1871
City of Austin “supposed[ly]...contracted with a utility company in 1871 to supply the city with water” [the first
private company in the city]; $5,000 was appropriated for an artisian well to be dug on the capitol grounds.
1871
The toilet consisted of a “black walnut closet case, ‘E.P. Cup & Pull Container and French Bowl,’ 45 feet of threeinch iron soil pipe, a four-inch ‘S’ trap and four-inch reducer were all ordered from a Galveston firm by the State
Engineer in September 1871.”

Austin City Ordinance.
On March 13, 1875, the Second Session of the 14th Legislature, approved the installation of gas light at the
Governor’s Mansion. “A $3,000 appropriation for gas pipes [for lights], chandeliers, and other necessary [gas]
fixtures to light the mansion and capitol”…was made. Work was completed on May 6, 1875. An act to provide water
to the capitol grounds was approved on August 17, 1876.
Four hydrants were installed “to provide water for the garden and shrubbery,” and fountains were established on
the Mansion grounds. The Statesman reported in January 1877 that "a pretty little fountain will play in front of the
Governor’s Mansion and four hydrants will supply the garden and shubbery there.”
A Statesman report in January 1877 made a plea for underwater [sic] sewers: “The Grounds of the capitol will never
be properly habitable till the pipes of expurgation have been buried beneath the surface of the paved roadways and
the accumulation of filth of nearly 40 years swept into the Colorado.”

Event
Bills for goods and services are collected from August 1870 to February 1871. “The evidence of extensive outdoor
planting is clear” and included three months of service by a gardener, 341 loads of dirt and 166 loads of
manure, gardening tools, orders for plants including a peach and cherry tree, seed packs (petunias, stock,
narcissus, verbena, hyacinth, jonquils, hollyhocks, larkspurs, and heliotrope; garden plants included celery,
parsley, shallots, endive, radish, cucumber, and potatoes); rose pushes, shrubs, honeysuckle, euonymus, “Irish
junipers,” cane jasmine, and white and purple altheas. Other supplies ordered for repair work include four gate
latches, 12 loads of gravel and sand, and 5 loads of bricks.
An act was approved on May 17, 1871, by the 12th Legislature to incorporate the Austin Gas Company. At that
time, the corporation was “hereby empowered to lay down their gas pipes, and to erect gas posts, burners and
reflectors in the streets, lanes, alleys, avenues and public grounds...”
On November 25, 1871, the Second Session of the 12th Legislature, approved the following appropriations: “Eleven
thousand dollars, or so much thereof may be necessary to complete the artisian well and build two new cisterns in
the capitol yard” as well as money appropriated to purchase a “first class steam fire engine.” Approval for the
establishment of a Fire Department for the City of Austin was approved on December 1, 1871.
The Houston and Texas Central Railroad reached Austin in December 1871.
Evidence suggests that a gazebo and a summer house were built between 1870 and 1874. "Photographs from 1900
show a summer house at the rear of the mansion with lattice-work enclosure and a turret-style roof above what
seams to be an octagonal building. Bills from the Davis Administration papers indicate that a summer or
garden house was built in 1870. An 1870 photograph taken when the Davis family arrived in Austin shows an
empty front yard, and one dated in 1878 shows a gazebo on the south side of the front lawn. Miss Ima Hogg said
there was no gazebo in 1891, but she described a summer house located in the backyard. The gazebo and the
summer house were similar in architectural styles and both may have been built during the Davis Administration."
The “Mansion stable” is mentioned in a Daily Statesman Journal, but the precise date of the article is not specified.

Event
On April 1, 1881, the legislature approved a budget that included “labor to keep the executive mansion and grounds
in order” as well as “water supply for the capitol grounds, executive mansion and land office for fire and other
purposes.”
“The Seventeenth Legislature in April and May 1882 appropriated funds and authorized contracting for water
supply…filtered and suitable for culinary and other domestic purposes…delivered in sufficient quantities…and
with such pressure as to be available at all times.”
An act approved February 3, 1883, by the 18th Legislature, appropriated $4,500 for repairs to the Mansion, for
which they described the mansion “not fitted for comfortable occupancy” and “an imperative public necessity and
emergency.” Repairs between 1883 and 1885 included the addition of two water closets and telephone lines
[possibly one of the first in Texas]. “A $1,200 appropriation was made for sewerage [sic]...to connect with proposed
sewerage from the temporary capitol.” In March 1883, the Statesman stated that the yards were beautiful, the
shubbery trimmed, fountains put in order, outhouses repaired and painted, a new stable built [in the southwest
corner of the lot] and the mansion painted. The columns, cornices, and front door trim were painted dark, probably
green. This is an important observation for identifying photographs from this period.
The superintendent of public buildings and grounds reported in 1888: “The grounds occupied by this building and
attached improvements comprise the entire block No. 158…It’s roof construction has never been perfect…and
though it has been well cared for and recently repaired and painted inside and out, the fencing and cisterns
overhauled....There should be permanent pavement and curbing around the entire lot, and the grounds
appropriately improved and adorned; also includes with a modern fence.” By 1890, the superintendent described
the fence as “decayed and worthless, and should be replaced with one more substantial and modern. The sidewalks
around the mansion square are very rough, and should be paved.”
During the Hogg term (1881–1895) it was stated that “The other ‘necessary facilities’ [i.e, the privies] were still a
distance from the main house. Heating water on the kitchen stove took a very long time, so as a rule the Hogg men
would bathe in the cistern house, which was a very chilly experience.”
Governor Hogg (1891–1895) stated that “the one, and inadequate, bathroom was modernized…” This was paid for
out of pocket by Governor Hogg, who was later reimbursed by the legislature.
In November 1892 and December 1894, the superintendent of public buildings and grounds comments on the fence
and sidewalks: “The unsightly and useless fence should be removed, and the precipitous, if not dangerous
sidewalks should be lowered to the standard grade of the streets, and the four fronts terraced back to
conform thereto.”
The Statesman in 1891 stated that “Texas should tear down that barn on the hill and give the governor a
respectable home…The Legislature should not only pull down the Governor’s Mansion, but also the ground that
surrounds it to the proper level of the street.”
The legislature appropriated $3,000 for “repairs, grounds improvement and furniture” and an additional $2,900 for
“a gardener, labor and ground maintenance, water, ice, housekeeper, fuel and lights…”

Event
Superintendent of buildings and grounds reported in 1898 “a new fence has been placed around the entire
block, grounds graded and planted with grass. The sidewalks have been terraced and new steps and other
improvements made.”
From March to August 1901, the legislature appropriated $230 for a cement walk, $400 for labor for the grounds;
$62 to repair the cistern…the total amount appropriated for Sayers’ two terms was $8,000 which “included the
installation of electric lights and the construction of a new stable [now known as the carriage house]...The
carefully detailed plans called for a light-colored brick exterior, a carriage room, stalls, a stair to the ‘tower, or
man’s room, in the attic,’ and sliding doors for the main entrance. This was a much fancier stable that apparently
replaced the one described by Miss Ima Hogg in 1891. The new stable sat at the rear of the Mansion slightly north
of the center of the lot.”
In November 1900, the superintendent of buildings and grounds reported that “the grounds have been improved,
cement sidewalks, Bermuda grass terraces and cement block curbing have been constructed entirely
around the ground, part of the old fence removed and the remainder repaired and repainted....”
Around 1901, Mrs. Sayers removed “the ugly fountains that stood like stiff sentinels on either side of the front
walk.”
In 1902, the superintendent of building and grounds reported, “Trees, flowers and grass have been planted on the
lawns surrounding the Mansion; all walks have been graveled.…” The exterior paint was also changed to its
original white from the dark green cornice and columns of the 1883–1885 repairs.
On May 1, 1903, the legislature passed an act to provide “a system of electric power, electric lights and
waterworks….to the State Capitol, the General Land Office, Governor’s Mansion and various public institutions of
the State of Texas in the City of Austin and adjacent thereto.”
Appropriation of $12,000 for improvements to the Governor’s Mansion passed by the 33rd Legislature became law
on August 23, 1913. This money was used for major renovations that were completed in 1914 during Governor
Colquitt’s second term.
“The new conservatory (later called the family dining room) was twenty-three feet wide and nineteen feet
deep…This room was built over the original cistern and porch area.”
An interview with Mrs. Stuart Watt, daughter of Governor and Mrs. James E. “Ma and Pa” Ferguson, revealed that
“Under the dining room of the main house the old cellar remained intact with only two changes. Before the new
addition, the cellar had been entered from a stairway under the back porch, which was closed with the
addition of the conservatory. A new entrance was provided on the south side with a stairway running up to ground
level bear the south exit from the library.”
“During the construction from March 23 to September 9, 1914, the mansion meals were prepared in a tent at the
southwest corner of the house.…Most outhouses in the rear were torn down, and the old cistern house, summer
house and picket fences across the front and sides of the yard were removed. The only remaining fences
enclosed the horse lot in the southwest corner and the carriage house in the northeast corner.”
On June 14, 1915, the 34th Legislature approved an appropriation of $5,000 per year for mansion improvements in
1916 and 1917.

Event
Around 1915, a greenhouse was added to the southwest corner, and the mansion’s upstairs front porch was
screened. “The greenhouse was connected to the mansion by a long vine-covered arbor....The greenhouse was
heated with a boiler and hot water system.” (Note that a heater is depicted adjacent to the greenhouse on the
1935 Sanborn Map, Sheet 19.)
In the early months of 1927, there was “A special emergency appropriation of $12,000 for repairs and furnishings...
[including] roof and plumbing repairs, a new shower in the southeast bedroom, and a new heating and
refrigeration plant” (which was not installed until around 1933). Additional funds were for “re-wiring,
repainting, adding iron rails and cement steps at the front entry to replace the wooden steps which collapsed
following a large reception, and conversion of the vegetable garden to a flower garden.”
In 1933 during the early part of the Great Depression “regular itemized appropriations for maintenance, labor and
utilities were reduced by a total of $1,450 per year. But in a special session soon after, the legislature appropriated
$1,500 for an “electric refrigeration unit” and landscaping at the mansion. “With these funds the refrigeration unit
was purchased, trees were planted, a retaining wall was built on the north side of the Mansion, and the low places
were filled in on that side of the house. The older trees were also inspected and treated.”
In January of 1941 O’Daniel’s inauguration party involved pits dug on the mansion grounds to cook 19,000
pounds of beef.
To accommodate the First Lady Stephenson, who was confined to a wheelchair, “an elevator was installed in the
back hall” and “the south entrance to the Mansion, which had been used to reach the cellar, was sealed” to create a
powder room.
After Governor Shivers took office in 1949, “The family soon embarked on a program of repairs, renovations and
redecoration that would bring the Mansion to its finest state of elegance.” In 1951, the legislature made “a special
appropriation of $50,000 for Mansion repairs, air conditioning, furnishings, china, silver, utilities and other needs."
Auditors reports indicate that “a total of $102,075.48 was spent for Mansion repairs, furnishings and equipment
during the seven and a half years of the Shivers administration.”
“The central heading and cooling system was a twenty-five ton gas unit placed in the original basement under the
State dining room. Installed in February 1952 at a cost of $24,000, it did not serve the kitchen, pantry, and security
room [on the west side of the mansion]; neither did it adequately cool the rest of the house....” In addition, “steam
radiators and pipes were removed, and all wiring and pipes were recessed” in the mansion walls. “The fireplace in
the northwest bedroom was sealed and the wall plastered.”
“The new roof in 1954 replaced the wooden frame and metal roofing with structural steel framing, a poured-in-place
gypsum roof deck, and built-up roofing at a cost of $14,000. In the process, the existing chimneys were removed and
the openings sealed.” A TV antenna was added. Mechanical improvements in the basement included the addition of
a steam boiler, gas service piping, a steam hot water heater (that replaced the gas-fire hot water heater). A gas hot
water heater was installed in the “garage for the servants’ quarters” [in the mansion or in the carriage house?].
Finally, “the kitchens were modernized with new equipment.”

Event
During the early years of the Price Daniel administration, significant repairs made to the Mmnsion included: repair
of the hallway ceiling (a portion of the ceiling had collapsed on Governor Daniel); revamping the air conditioning
plant; adding steel beams to support the staircase; curving the southwest corner of the staircase to conceal an
air duct; adding an underground sprinkler system; repairing walkways; and adding a new retaining wall
on the south side of the grounds.
In the last years of the Price Daniel administration, “the State Building Commission and the Board of Control spent
nearly $40,000 for extensive repairs to the foundation, a new air conditioning system, and necessary changes in the
basement.”
During the Connally administration, the Mansion underwent “a complete restoration and renovation” and “the
grounds were beautifully landscaped and enclosed by a brick and iron fence.” “An historic fence, stored in the State
Cemetery after removal in the early 1960s to make way for new buildings in the Capitol complex, was rescued and
installed at the front entrance to the Mansion. The ‘Buckye Fence,’ originally installed around the Capitol grounds
in 1890, took its name from Springfield, Ohio, the Buckeye State, where it was made. The design is a row of fivepointed stars, symbolic of the Lone Star State. The fences was installed on top of the new brick foundation at the
front of the Mansion and flanked on each side by raised sections of the brick fence...”
From 1966 to 1968, landscaping of the mansion grounds was done with funding raised by the Texas Garden Clubs.
With some state funds included, a total of $250,000 was spent on the landscape renovations. The two-acre grounds
were transformed into “a modern, orderly arrangement…Terraces and walkways in the formal garden area were
usable as an outdoor stage. The porte cochere was extended ten feet ten inches....Other changes included a new
brick courtyard and parking area for sixteen cars; a bricked front walk, steps and porch; and a solid
brick fence (painted white) surrounding the entire property. The fence graduated from a screening and
security height in the rear of the lot to a lower level in the front, which allowed a view from the street up the
sloping lawns to the old house. Iron entrance gates at the rear were made to match the old fence. Plans to recreate
a gazebo as it appeared on the mansion lawn in the 1880s were postponed.” (The replica gazebo was not constructed
until ca. 1979–1982).
Plans for repairs and renovations were begun in July 1969. An appropriation of $25,000 funded the installation of a
sprinkler system, a new boiler, and replacement of outside lighting. An additional $35,000 was appropriated for
a fire alarm system.
In reaction to Vietnam War protests, security at the mansion was tightened: 12 lawmen rotated on 24 hour duty,
and front gates were installed. The fence was vandalized.

Extensive renovations during the Clements term began in 1979 and were completed by April 1982. Restorationrelated changes included: restoration of door to the south lawn; restoration of an alcove behind the south
exterior door; construction of a wood front porch to replace recent brick porch; construction of a gazebo on the
south lawn to resemble that seen in an 1870s photograph; reinforcement of basic support elements;
upgrading plumbing and wiring fixtures; gas added for cooking in kitchen (all gas lines had been removed from
the house earlier); installation of security system; restoration of 1900 carriage house to look like original
facade; renovation to carriage house for DPS and mansion staff; re-roofing and reconfigured roof over the new porte
cochere (the only new element added); driveway widened; sections of brick wall on either side of the gate on the
north side of the carriage house; brick walk widened (front entrance); sprinkler system upgraded;
decorative (outdoor) lighting system upgraded; sections of massive walls replaced with wrought-iron fence;
landscaping, lighting, security system, and gazebo. The overall renovations cost $4 million and were paid for with
state and private funding.

reach the ground until the 1880s or 1890s [An­
thony 2008b]). At the turn of the century, elec­
tricity was installed, and a new stable (the
existing carriage house) was built (Daniel et al.
1984:89–96, 99, 105, 106, 129).
But the most substantial renovation hap­
pened from 1911 to 1915 (Daniel et al. 1984:143–
144). The old kitchen ell attached to the back of
the mansion was removed and replaced with a
new wing. As described by an “inspector of ma­
sonry, public buildings and works,” the new wing
housed a “conservatory, additional bed rooms,
kitchen, and basement for furnace and wash

room. This addition was made to conform with
the old building. Cost, with wiring, lighting, and
plumbing, $11,000” (Daniel et al. 1984:143).
Each of these changes involved
disturbance to the grounds underneath or
around the mansion. Over the years, old
improvements were dismantled, removed, or
buried to make way for new additions. These
historical events helped shaped all aspects of
the mansion, including the below-ground
remnants of older structures and features that
were encountered during archeological
monitoring.

ARCHEOLOGICAL MONITORING FOR THE
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECT

2

THC’s Archeology Division to coordinate all as­
pects of the archeological monitoring. The goals
of the archeological investigations were: 1) to
identify any intact deposits containing nine­
teenth-century artifacts or features, and 2) to
conduct a thorough archeological investigation
of any such deposits or features that were dis­
covered. PAI would contact the THC immedi­
ately when an important historical feature was
discovered. While each feature was being inves­
tigated, PAI would arrange for a site visit by an
Archeology Division representative (at various
times Mark Denton, James Bruseth, or Bill
Martin). During the onsite consultations, man­
agement decisions were made to define how fea­
tures would be investigated and documented,
to determine if a feature could be preserved in
place, or to determine if a feature was docu­
mented sufficiently and could be removed to al­
low construction activities to proceed.
For the archeological investigations at the
Governor’s Mansion, PAI archeologists origi­
nally proposed that the work be done in two
phases. During Phase I, PAI would direct and
monitor preconstruction excavations in selected
areas where construction plans called for sub­
surface excavation. This archeological work
would be done before any actual construction
excavations began. During Phase II, PAI arche­
ologists would monitor the construction exca­
vations being done by other contractors. In this
phase, PAI would have the authority to stop all
digging to examine and investigate deposits and
features.
Before fieldwork even started, however,
Phase I was eliminated. As the complexities of
this project became clear, the idea of conduct­
ing archeological investigations before actual
construction began proved unfeasible. The fo­

PROJECT BACKGROUND
The Deferred Maintenance Project for the
Texas Governor’s Mansion—Project No. 08-058­
3008 for the Texas Facilities Commission (TFC)
(2008a, 2008b)—involved a major effort to reno­
vate and update the mansion facilities. Many
state agencies, contractors, and subcontractors
coordinated the archeological efforts for this
project. Table 2.1 lists the key players that
worked with Prewitt and Associates, Inc. (PAI),
during the archeological field investigations.
PAI was first contacted about this project
in October 2007, and communications and plan­
ning for the cultural resources monitoring be­
gan immediately. A preliminary planning
meeting was held onsite among representatives
of the TFC (Darrel Wallace), the Texas Histori­
cal Commission (THC) (Mark Denton), Texas
State Preservation Board (Lee Baker), Braun
& Butler (Brandon Currey), and PAI (Doug
Boyd). PAI submitted a preliminary proposal to
the TFC on October 23 and submitted a revised
proposal to TFC and Terracon on December 14,
2007. Terracon, under its prime contract
(No. 05GEO01-00-00) with the TFC, then sub­
contracted PAI to conduct the archeological in­
vestigations. In compliance with the rules and
regulations of the Texas Antiquities Code, PAI
submitted an archeology permit application to
the THC. On January 4, 2008, the THC issued
Antiquities Permit No. 4752 to authorize PAI
to conduct the archeological investigations.
PAI participated in a project kickoff meet­
ing onsite on February 20, 2008. Actual field­
work to monitor construction excavations began
on March 12 and continued intermittently
through May 27. PAI worked closely with the

Chapter 2: Archeological Monitoring
cus of the investigations shifted to archeologi­
cal monitoring that would be done in conjunc­
tion with construction excavations.
Consequently, the schedule of archeological work
was largely dictated by the schedule of construc­
tion activities. PAI archeologists were essen­
tially on call at all times and had to work with
many different contractors as various tasks were
performed.
PAI’s monitoring of construction excavations
was divided into two types of work: monitoring
of exterior excavations related to replacement
or installation of utilities, and monitoring of
excavations to expand the basement underneath
the conservatory of the 1914 addition (see Daniel
et al. 1984:277). Most of the exterior plumbing
excavations were done by Mid-State Plumbing,
so PAI worked closely with the company’s crews
and construction foreman, Hiram Huett. A small
backhoe was used for most of the exterior exca­
vations, and only deep or tight areas were dug
by hand. In the basement expansion, Lehne
Construction did all of the excavations by hand
utilizing pneumatic picks.
The archeological work was originally pro­
jected to only take a few weeks, but it soon be­
came clear that this estimate was unrealistic.
There were many construction plan changes and
unanticipated delays that affected the schedule
of the archeological work. On two occasions, PAI
had to renegotiate with the TFC and Terracon
to add effort to the archeological monitoring
project. The monitoring for the project began on
March 12, 2008, and continued though May 28,
only 11 days before the mansion burned. At the
time of the fire, construction excavation that was
not completed but would require archeological
monitoring included a ca. 30-ft-long segment of
water line trenching on the south lawn and lim­
ited trenching for new security camera lines in
the north lawn.
Archeological investigation areas were dic­
tated solely based on construction needs and
correspond with construction excavations for
plumbing improvements, both water and waste­
water, and expansion of the basement. The ar­
cheological fieldwork was segmented into 11
areas that were defined in sequence as archeo­
logical investigations were done in each new
area.
Area designations are used throughout this
report to indicate archeological investigation
areas for discussion purposes. Areas 1, 2, and 5

involved the upgrading of the wastewater sys­
tem. These excavations were done to expose and
access sections of old ceramic sewer pipes—some
buried at depths of more than 10 ft—so that new
flexible sewer lines could be run inside the old
pipes. This method was preferred over the al­
ternative of digging up and replacing the entire
sewer line. Areas 3 and 6 were hand dug to
search for manhole locations that were sug­
gested by a remote camera run inside the old
sewer line. No manholes were found; it was later
determined that buried security camera lines
were causing electrical interference with the
remote camera, causing it to give false locations.
METHODS AND RESULTS OF
MONITORING
PAI conducted archeological monitoring of
11 areas and discovered 15 cultural features.
Figure 2.1 shows the locations of these areas
and features, and Table 2.2 describes them
briefly.
In addition to discovering cultural features
during archeological monitoring, PAI found his­
toric artifacts and collected special samples—
primarily mortar and sediment—from feature
and nonfeature contexts. In most investigation
areas, all of the artifacts were collected so that
they could be documented and analyzed in the
laboratory rather than in the field. In some
cases, especially in disturbed areas where arti­
facts were abundant and redundant (as in
Area 1), only a sample of artifacts was collected.
The artifacts and samples are discussed in
greater detail in Chapter 4.
During the project, most of the artifacts re­
covered were temporarily stored in bags or buck­
ets labeled with provenience information and
kept on the Governor’s Mansion property. Near
the end of the project, all of the artifacts and
samples were brought to the PAI laboratory for
identification and analysis. Following this, all
of the recovered artifacts were reviewed to de­
termine which were of sufficient historical sig­
nificance to warrant permanent curation. The
decisions were made on a case-by-case basis in
conjunction with the THC based primarily on
two factors: 1) the nature of the artifact, and
2) its cultural context. Many of the artifacts,
such as nails or chunks of coal recovered from
obviously disturbed sediments, were determined
not to be significant and were discarded. Arti­

ing and air conditioning line (i.e., a Dectron
system that was installed in 2005 (Sherry
Allsup, personal communication 2008), as well
as several large concrete slabs or vaults en­
casing sections of buried utilities.
Once the utility lines were located, some
abandoned lines were removed, some active
lines had to be moved, and new plumbing utili­
ties were installed. Then the Area 1 excavation
was expanded to create a space large enough
for the new concrete grease trap. When the
Area 1 excavations were completed, the exca­
vation area extended approximately 20–25 ft
northward from the north wall of the 1914 ad­
dition and 20–25 westward from the northwest
corner of the original 1856 mansion. The entire
excavation area was dug to a depth of 10 ft. The
volume of this excavation is estimated to be be­
tween 4,000 and 6,250 cubic feet.
During the three months of archeological
investigations on the Governor’s Mansion
grounds, portions of Area 1 were excavated, of­
ten filled in temporarily, and then re-excavated
and enlarged many times. Further complicat­
ing matters, many of the features encountered
were of historic age, and work would stop tem­
porarily to allow PAI archeologists to map the
feature location, draw measured sketches, make
observations and notes, take photographs, and
take samples if necessary. After the archeologi­
cal documentation was completed and the
plumbing lines and grease trap were installed,
Area 1 was filled in with a massive amount of
sand placed around the plumbing and grease
trap, followed by a layer of topsoil.
Six historic features were found and docu­
mented in Area 1 (Figure 2.2):

facts that were deemed significant, such as
samples of each of the types of historic bricks
found, were cataloged and prepared for perma­
nent curation.
CONSTRUCTION AREAS
INVESTIGATED
The construction excavation areas moni­
tored varied from small test excavations, such
as those in Areas 3 and 6, to large excavations,
such as the 2,600-sq-ft basement expansion in
Area 10 and the ca. 4,000-sq-ft excavation in
Area 1. Each area is described in detail below,
and features are described in Chapter 5.
Area 1, North Side of
1914 Addition
Area 1 is located near the northwest corner
of the mansion, along the north wall of the 1914
addition (see Figure 2.1, Table 2.2). Excavation
in this area was required for two primary pur­
poses. The first excavations were done to gain
access to the old sewer lines to install a new
sewer pipe liner. The old ceramic sewer pipes
were deeply buried, as much as 10 ft below the
ground surface. The line came out of the build­
ing on the north side of the 1914 addition and
split, with one line receiving waste from the car­
riage house to the west and the main line drain­
ing to the east toward the main city sewer line
that runs along Colorado Street. The second con­
struction task in Area 1 was the installation of
a 7,000-pound concrete grease trap, which re­
quired a very large excavation. The prefabri­
cated concrete box measured about 7 ft 10 inches
long, 4 ft 4 inches wide, and 4 ft 6 inches deep,
which required a very large hole. The excava­
tion had to be at least 8 to 10 ft deep so that the
grease trap could be laid on a bed of sand and
then covered with a layer of sand and a reason­
able amount of topsoil.
The Area 1 excavations were initially
relatively small, but difficulties arose when
many historic and recent features were en­
countered. A variety of buried utility lines,
both functional and abandoned, were found
to crisscross the expanse of Area 1, which cre­
ated many complications and slowed the ex­
cavations. A considerable hand-excavation
effort was expended to expose the various
utility lines, including a 24-inch PVC heat­

Feature 1 – a concrete manhole
Feature 4 – a concrete manhole
Feature 5 – a linear concrete slab
Feature 6 – a linear concrete slab
Feature 8 – a brick-walled grease trap
Feature 9 – a completely intact brick­
lined cistern
The construction work required that only
one feature be destroyed. The grease trap was
removed after being thoroughly documented,
following onsite consultation with the THC. All
other features in this area were left intact. Most
important, the historic cistern (Feature 9) was
protected throughout the course of construction.
22

Chapter 2: Archeological Monitoring
At the conclusion of the work, it was filled with
sand and reburied.
A variety of artifacts were found in Area 1,
but most were recovered from extensively dis­
turbed sediments in and around the various
buried utilities. It was clear that almost all of
the sediments in Area 1 were jumbled from hav­
ing been dug up and replaced, perhaps many
times, over the last 150 years. Artifacts collected
from Area 1 include bricks, an iron spike, a ce­
ramic sewer pipe fragment, a concrete fragment,
an unusual brick fragment with a decorative
attachment, a whiteware sherd, glass and win­
dow fragments, a plant border stake, coal frag­
ments, a clear glass bottle neck, and a brass
fixture tentatively identified as an air condition­
ing part. Sediment and mortar samples were
collected from several feature and nonfeature
locations in Area 1.

For a short time the plumbing plans also
called for the installation of a 10-ft-deep 6x6-ft
manhole near the street to allow access to this
location if the sewer pipe needed inspecting or
cleaning. This required a second excavation on
the east side of the perimeter wall. Because it
would be a long time before the construction
excavation was done to install the manhole, the
archeologists hand dug an exploratory trench
to examine the deposits. The trench was east of
the property wall and east of the public side­
walk that runs north-south parallel to Colorado
Street. This excavation measured 3 ft east-west
by 1 ft north-south and was dug a depth of 1.5 ft,
with an estimated volume of 4.5 cubic ft. This
excavation was terminated when plans changed
again. The trench remained open for several
weeks but was backfilled by the archeologist at
the request of the site superintendent. The man­
hole was not installed during the monitoring
phase of the project but was presumably added
sometime later.
One cultural feature, designated as Feature
2, was also recorded within the main excava­
tion block of Area 2. It is a historic limestone
wall running east-west, with a perpendicular
row of bricks. This feature is likely an old stair­
way wall along a former walkway or some type
of decorative landscaping feature. The only ar­
tifacts recovered from Area 2 were bricks and
brick fragments. Although the artifacts are from
disturbed contexts, they appear to be associated
with disturbed parts of Feature 2. A sample of
mortar was taken from Feature 2. When the
construction work and archeological studies
were completed, the large block excavation in
Area 2 was backfilled, and Feature 2 was left
intact except for the section of bricks north of
the limestone wall that had to be removed.
Many major landscaping changes were
made over the years (see Tables 1.1 and 1.2),
and there is no way of know just how much
ground disturbance occurred or how much arti­
ficial fill was brought in. For example, Daniel
et al. (1984:92) note that in the 1870s “341 loads
of dirt and 166 loads of manure” were ordered
for the Governor’s Mansion along with many
other landscaping supplies. The deposits are
extensively disturbed, and much of the upper
soil appears to be artificial fill that was brought
in to raise the ground level. Relative to the sur­
face of Colorado Street and the sidewalk just
outside the perimeter fence, the ground surface

Area 2, North of
East Entry Gate
Area 2 is located along the east fence of the
mansion grounds just north of the east entry
gate (see Figure 2.1 and Table 2.2). The perim­
eter fence around the mansion was built in the
1960s, during Governor Connally’s term (Daniel
et al. 1984:245). It is a 16-inch-thick brick wall
that stands about 2 to 3 ft high, with tall brick
columns at intervals along the wall and sections
of ornamental iron fencing in between the col­
umns. The Area 2 excavations consisted of a
large block on the west side of the fence and a
smaller trench on the east side of the fence (Fig­
ure 2.3). Feature 2 was discovered in the larger
excavation west of the fence.
Area 2 was excavated to expose the old
sewer pipe as it exits the property to connect
with the city’s main sewer line along Colorado
Street. Extensive machine and hand excavations
were conducted immediately west of the perim­
eter fence, north of the brick wall that marks
the north side of the sidewalk entrance to the
mansion grounds. Once the plumbing contrac­
tors located the sewer pipe on the west side of
the perimeter fence, the sewer pipe liner was
fed into it and pushed westward. The large ex­
cavation block extended ca. 15 ft north of the
entrance wall and roughly 13 ft west of the pe­
rimeter wall. Excavations varied from 4 to 8 ft
deep, for a total estimated volume of 1,170
cubic ft.

Area 3, Northeast Lawn Test

Area 5, South Side of
Carriage House

A shovel-size exploratory hole in the
northeast lawn was excavated by the plumb­
ing contractors in an attempt to locate a pre­
sumed manhole (see Figure 2.1 and Table 2.2).
This location was chosen because a remote
camera run down the sewer line from Area 1
suggested that the sewer line made a right
angle that appeared to be a manhole to the
surface. The test excavation was placed 10 ft
north-northeast of the corner of a brick-lined
garden retaining wall that lines the north­
east corner of the mansion. The hole was
roughly 2x2 ft and only 2 ft deep, with a total
volume of roughly 8 cubic ft.
The excavation was abandoned when no
manhole was found; it was later determined that
buried security camera and electrical lines were
interfering with the electrical signal from the
remote camera. No cultural materials or fea­
tures were found in Area 3, and the hole was
backfilled within a few days.

Area 5 is located within a raised planter box
along the south side of the carriage house in the
northwest quadrant of the mansion grounds (see
Figure 2.1 and Table 2.2). The purpose of this
excavation was to locate the old sewer pipes
running out of the carriage house so that a new
sewer pipe liner could be installed. Hand exca­
vations inside the planter box exposed several
buried pipes, some of which were abandoned.
After the functioning sewer pipe was identified,
the old pipe was burst and the new pipe liner
was installed.
The planter box consists of a brick wall
about 1 ft wide and 16 inches tall. It is trapezoi­
dal, and its long side measures approximately
28 ft long (east-west) adjacent to the south wall
of the carriage house. It is 15 ft wide along the
west edge of the planter box and tapers down to
about 5 ft wide on its east edge. The south edge
of the planter box is curved, following the cur­
vature of the circular driveway at the back of
the mansion. Some areas inside the planter box
were hand excavated by plumbers to depths
ranging from 2 to 4 ft. No features were encoun­
tered, but artifacts found in the disturbed fill
include brick fragments and a ca. 1960s-era
bottle cap marked “OLD RED EYE” around a
longhorn head.

Area 4, Southeast Lawn Trench
Area 4 is a 155-ft-long water line trench in
the southeast lawn (see Figure 2.1 and Table
2.2). The trench was 1 ft wide and 2 ft deep. The
trench began near the southeast corner of the
property, where the mansion water line taps into
the city water main. It ran north for a distance
of 35 ft, then turned a right angle and ran west
for 20 ft, and then turned roughly 30 degrees
northwest and continued approximately 100 ft
to the south side of the mansion’s front porch.
The total volume of this trench excavation is
estimated to be approximately 310 cubic ft. Four
cultural features were exposed and documented
(Figure 2.4). There are historic landscaping fea­
tures interpreted as a possible fountain location
(Feature 11), a gravel walkway (Feature 12), and
a brick-lined gravel walkway (Feature 13). The
fourth is a pit of unknown age (Feature 7).
As in Area 2, the deposits in Area 4 are ex­
tensively disturbed, and much of the upper soil
appears to be artificial fill that was brought in
to raise the ground level. Relative to the sur­
face of Colorado Street and the sidewalk just
outside the perimeter fence, the ground surface

Area 6, Northeast Lawn Trench
Area 6 is a 3x6-ft trench excavated in the
northeast lawn in search of a presumed man­
hole to access the sewer line (see Figure 2.1 and
Table 2.2). This location was chosen because a
remote camera sent down the sewer line from
Area 1 detected a right angle bend that was
thought to be a manhole to the surface. The
trench was excavated using a small backhoe to
about 6 ft deep, exposing 3 ft of disturbed fill
layers overlying sandy gravel grading into red­
dish gravelly clay. No manhole was found, and
it was later determined that the precise loca­
tion of the remote camera inside the sewer line
was not accurate because shallowly buried se­
curity camera and electrical lines were inter­
fering with the electrical signal from the camera.

Archeological Investigations at the Governor’s Mansion
Several bricks were found in the trench at
1–2 ft. These bricks could be pavers associated
with an old walkway or garden, but no appar­
ent patterning was observed. These out-of-con­
text bricks, as well as the jumbled appearance
of the sediments in the trench profile, indicate
that the upper 3 ft of deposits in this area is
extensively disturbed. No other cultural mate­
rials or features were observed in Area 6.

an average depth of 8 ft, which was the depth
needed for pouring new concrete footings be­
low the existing wall foundation. The work­
ers also dug a 4-ft-wide trench another 4 ft to
the south to create an 8-ft-long ramp that
would provide access to the basement. Dur­
ing later work in the basement expansion area
(see Area 10 below), a conveyor mechanism
was set up in this ramp to bring fill from the
basement to the ground surface just south of
the mansion.
Prior to PAI’s involvement, construction
workers conducted a deep test excavation in this
area to investigate the condition of the basement
footings. Extensive disturbance was noted
throughout this test excavation, and it was de­
termined that this disturbance was associated
with the builder’s trench dug when the 1914
addition was constructed. Based on this infor­
mation, PAI archeologists did not monitor Area
8 as closely as they did other areas. Periodic
checks continually confirmed that all the upper
fill from this area was previously disturbed, and
the lower fill was intact gravelly substrate. The
dirt-moving crews collected artifacts from the
disturbed fill and showed them to the archeolo­
gist on a daily basis. Artifacts recovered from
Area 8 include two iron pipe sections (one of
which was removed from its position embedded
in the basement wall), a fragment of flat win­
dow glass, a thin iron landscape edging frag­
ment, an iron hand-pick blade fragment, a
ribbed ceramic sewer pipe fragment, and a plas­
tic plant identification label. No cultural fea­
tures were identified in Area 8.

Area 7, East Side of
Carriage House
Area 7 was a small excavation at the front
of the carriage house (see Figure 2.1 and Table
2.2). A 2x3-ft cut was made in the concrete, with
the intent of digging deeper to explore the loca­
tion of a sewer line. The excavation extended to
about 3 ft below the top of the concrete surface;
the ceramic sewer pipe was exposed at about
2 ft. The excavation also exposed the brick foot­
ing underlying the carriage house. The footing
is considered to be a structural component of
the carriage house, which was built in 1901 as a
stable (Daniel et al. 1984:129–130). The brick
footing was photographed, but it was not re­
corded as a feature since it was an integral part
of the carriage house. A loose brick was collected
from the fill, but it is not directly associated with
the carriage house.
Area 8, South Side of
1914 Addition
Area 8 is located on the south side of the
1914 addition, immediately east of the south­
west corner of the mansion (see Figure 2.1 and
Table 2.2). While all other exterior excavation
areas were needed for plumbing improve­
ments, the Area 8 excavation was for the base­
ment expansion. This area was excavated for
two purposes: (1) to gain access to the foot­
ings along the south wall of the 1914 addi­
tion so new concrete footings could be poured
below the existing foundation; and (2) to pro­
vide access through the basement wall so that
the fill excavated during the basement expan­
sion could be easily removed. Because a tree
in this area was considered important and had
to be protected from harm, the dirt movers
were forced to work in a narrow 4-ft-wide
trench that ran east-west approximately 15 ft
along the south wall. This trench was dug to

Area 9, Crawlspace
Under 1856 Mansion
Area 9 is a narrow passageway under the
center of the original mansion building where
plumbing pipes needed to be inspected and up­
dated (see Figure 2.1 and Table 2.2). During the
plumber’s inspection, one of the plumbing crew
found and collected a single artifact. A square
nail was recovered and given to the PAI arche­
ologists, but its precise location could not be
determined. Because no excavations were re­
quired in Area 9, no archeological monitoring
or investigation was conducted in this area. This
find simply highlights the fact that there are
likely to be scattered historic artifacts below the
mansion.
28

Chapter 2: Archeological Monitoring
Area 10, Basement Expansion

was different from the rest of the 1914 construc­
tion work at this location. The wall section, des­
ignated as Feature 3, was composed primarily
of old handmade bricks and soft mortar, and it
had been integrated into the angled hallway
during the 1914 renovation work.
The removal of the ductwork also exposed
two additional features. Another section of brick
wall was found in the northern end of the base­
ment expansion area. It, too, was composed of
old handmade bricks and soft mortar, but it was
floating by itself inside an old builder’s trench.
Evidence suggests that this wall segment, called
Feature 10, is a remnant of the foundation for
the original kitchen ell that was removed dur­
ing the 1914 renovation work. Eight brick col­
umns spaced throughout the area were
designated as Feature 15, with individual col­
umns being identified as A through H. These
columns had obviously been built to provide
support for the floor of the 1914 addition and
were constructed from a wide variety of bricks
and hard concrete mortar. These columns were
clearly built long after the brick wall sections of
Features 3 and 10 and may have been added as
late as the 1950s or 1960s during heat and air
conditioning renovations.
The removal of ductwork also exposed some
interesting digging tool marks in one area. One
metal duct ran north-south within a 3-ft-wide
trench about 3 ft east of the west wall. When
the loose fill and sediments were brushed away,
numerous iron pick marks were found through­
out the trench. They were clearly patterned, with
the marks running lengthwise parallel with the
long axis of the trench. Construction workers
left these marks when they dug the trench to
install the duct during one of the many renova­
tion or repair episodes at the mansion.
Extensive excavation and removal of the fill
from the basement expansion area began in midApril and continued intermittently throughout
late May. The excavation work coincided with
different construction activities and changing
work schedules both inside and outside the
mansion. Archeological monitoring in Area 10
was done periodically, often concurrently with
outside monitoring, but constant monitoring was
not warranted because the fill being removed
was clearly an intact ancient deposit. The exca­
vation contractors and archeologists kept watch
for historic artifacts, but none were found dur­
ing the excavations.

The basement expansion was designated as
Area 10 (see Figure 2.1 and Table 2.2). The base­
ment needed to be expanded to provide more
space for the mechanical facility and a laundry
room. During this project, the existing basement
was expanded westward from an angled hall­
way all the way to the west and south walls of
the 1914 addition. This area included a portion
of the backyard of the original mansion as well
as portions of the kitchen ell, which was added
sometime after the original mansion was built.
To expand the basement, a massive amount
of fill was removed from beneath the floor of the
1914 addition. PAI archeologists monitored the
excavations intermittently from mid-March
through late May 2008, and by the time the base­
ment expansion was completed, four historic
cultural features had been discovered, investi­
gated, and documented (Figure 2.5).
The basement expansion is an odd-shaped
area with the following approximate dimen­
sions, beginning at the southeast corner: 19 ft
along the south wall of the 1914 addition; 24 ft
along the west wall of the 1914 addition; 7 ft
along the north edge, where a new wall was con­
structed roughly following the old foundation
of the original kitchen ell (see Feature 10); 11 ft
along the south wall of the angled hallway; 7 ft
south, then 4 ft east to the west wall of the origi­
nal mansion; and then 10 ft south to the south­
west corner. Approximately 6 to 8 ft of fill was
removed. The excavated fill consisted primarily
of an upper layer of extremely dry, powdery silty
clay over compact reddish brown gravelly clay.
These deposits represent the ancient Pleistocene
alluvial terrace deposits of the Colorado River
(see Chapter 1).
Before the excavations occurred, the entire
basement expansion area was a 2- to 3-ft-tall
crawlspace beneath the floor joists of the fam­
ily dining room (originally called the conserva­
tory; see Daniel et al. 1984:39, 143). The area
was crisscrossed with air conditioning ductwork,
cast iron pipes, and electrical lines. PAI arche­
ologists began examining the crawlspace on
March 12, 2008, but could not access all areas
of the basement until ductwork was removed
on March 16. Just inside the crawlspace, a sub­
stantial section of brick wall at the south end of
the angled hallway wall was immediately rec­
ognized as being a historic wall remnant that

Chapter 2: Archeological Monitoring
Before and during the excavations, special
attention was paid to the northwestern part of
Area 10. Several historic maps of the mansion
noted the location of a cistern just inside the
west wall of the 1914 addition (e.g., Daniel et al.
1984:38). A cistern at the mansion is mentioned
as early as 1856 (Hafertepe 1992:107, 108) and
is mentioned again in conjunction with the 1914
renovations (see Tables 1.1 and 1.2). During this
construction phase, the “old cistern house” (see
Figure 1.2) was removed and the “new conser­
vatory (later called the family dining
room)…was built over the original cistern and
porch area” (Daniel et al. 1984:143, 144). This
evidence suggests that the old cistern would
have been located somewhere in the basement
expansion area.
The bulk of the basement expansion exca­
vation work was completed by late May, and no
sign of a cistern was found. In fact, the hard grav­
elly clay deposits were completely intact
throughout the basement expansion area, thus
making it impossible for an underground cis­
tern to have been present at this spot. When
the investigations failed to find the cistern, there
were many discussions among the archeologists,
historians, plumbers, and others to try to un­
derstand why the historical evidence was so
misleading. This mystery continued unresolved
until May 23, 2008, when the excavation con­
tractors found a section of a curved brick wall
while digging underneath the concrete founda­
tion of the west wall of the 1914 addition. The
excavations ultimately exposed a 7-ft-wide and
10-ft deep section of this brick wall, which was
designated as Feature 14. The nature of the old
handmade bricks and the curvature of the wall,
both horizontal and vertical, left little doubt that
this was the old cistern that was mentioned in
historic records and depicted on plan maps of
the original 1856 mansion (see Daniel et al.
1984:26, 38).

vated the underlying fill to a depth of about 2 ft
below the floor level. This excavation exposed
the concrete foundation of the north wall of the
1914 addition, and the plumbers cut a vertical
opening (south to north) through this portion of
the concrete wall footing. All of this work was
done to expose the cast-iron pipes embedded in
the concrete floor and run pipes through the
basement wall of the mansion out into Area 1.
They then installed a drain pipe for the new
grease trap and a sewer pipe that connects to
the manhole (Feature 1) just north of the base­
ment wall.
The earthen fill removed from this excava­
tion was a strong brown gravelly and sandy clay
loam similar to the natural hard-packed grav­
elly deposits found in the basement expansion
area and in other deep excavation areas on the
mansion grounds. However, the matrix removed
from Area 11 appeared to be slightly different
in that it was a loose, unconsolidated fill that
may contain more fine-grained sand. It is pos­
sible that this is the natural fill at this location
but that it was dug out and replaced at some
time in the past. This fill could have been re­
moved and backfilled during the 1914 renova­
tions by excavation of a wall trench for the
basement foundation. It also is possible that this
was the natural fill that was altered in some
way, perhaps by adding fine-grained sand to the
gravelly mix to create a smoother surface for
laying the concrete floor.
No cultural features or artifacts were ob­
served in this area. Once the appropriate pipes
were installed, the excavation was backfilled
and the concrete floor was repaired.
SEARCH FOR THE SECOND
PRIVY LOCATION
During the previous archeological investi­
gations at the Governor’s Mansion in 1999, PAI
archeologists identified two original privy loca­
tions on the mansion grounds (Blake and Kibler
1999:1–10). The first privy, presumably built
about 1856, was found northwest of the man­
sion, near the front entrance to the carriage
house. This square or rectangular brick-lined
privy was used only for a short time, and a sec­
ond one was built somewhere on the south side
of the mansion. Based on several lines of his­
torical information, Blake and Kibler (1999:Fig­
ure 1) surmised that this second privy had been

Area 11 was a small 2x3-ft excavation in the
northeast corner of the 1914 basement (see Fig­
ure 1.2 and Table 2.2) immediately adjacent to
some vertical cast-iron sewage pipes that ex­
tended through the concrete floor. The plumb­
ers cut and removed a rectangular section of the
ca. 8- to 12-inch-thick concrete floor, then exca­

located somewhere in the vicinity of the current
gazebo (see Figure 1.1). Since planned water
lines were to cut across the south lawn, PAI ar­
cheologists felt that some remote sensing to
search for the privy would be helpful. PAI con­
tacted the Texas Historical Commission to ask
for assistance with this task. On May 8, 2008,
THC archeologists Tiffany Osburn and Bill
Pierson conducted a ground-penetrating radar
survey of the target search area on the south
lawn. The methods and results of this remote
sensing study are presented in Chapter 3.
To understand the feature discussions in
subsequent chapters, it is helpful to know some­
thing about the layout of the original mansion
and the structural changes that occurred in
1914. Figure 2.6 depicts three floor plans for the
ground floor of the Governor’s Mansion (all re­

GROUND-PENETRATING RADAR SURVEY
ON THE SOUTH LAWN

3

Tiffany Osburn and Douglas K. Boyd

At the request of Prewitt and Associates,
Inc., the Texas Historical Commission conducted
a ground-penetrating radar (GPR) survey on the
south lawn of the Governor’s Mansion in con­
junction with the Deferred Maintenance Project.
The goal of this survey was to prospect for a
possibly privy pit in the central portion of the
south lawn. The target location was identified
in previous work by Blake and Kibler (1999:Fig­
ure 1) as being in the vicinity of the current ga­
zebo (see Figure 1.1). Figure 3.1 shows the area
surveyed (see Area 4 in Chapter 5).

propagation are dry sediments and soils. Al­
though the dense, clayey sediment at the
Governor’s Mansion was moderately moist,
the depth of radar penetration was sufficient
for imaging shallow historic features.
When reflections from buried objects are
viewed in two dimensions, they often appear as
hyperbolic reflections. These reflections are pro­
duced from buried “point sources” such as pipes
or large rocks as opposed to planar surfaces such
as buried pathways or floors. The wide angle or
“footprint” of the radar beam causes the antenna
to “see” the object as it moves toward it and con­
tinues to “see” it as it moves over and away from
the buried object, resulting in a hyperbolic re­
flection along the transect.
The GPR system used at the Governor’s
Mansion was a Geophysical Survey Systems
Inc. (GSSI) Subsurface Interface Radar (SIR)
3000 model. A dual 400 MHz antenna was
used. Two block areas, one large and one
small, were surveyed for this project (Figure
3.3). The large survey block was located east
of an open water line trench and linear pile
of fill removed from the trench. This survey
grid, laid out as an 18x18-m area, wrapped
around three sides of the gazebo: the south,
east, and north. The survey transects in this
block were collected along the east-west axis.
The smaller survey block measured 5 m eastwest by 16 m north-south, and the survey
transects were collected on the north-south
axis. This smaller block essentially extended
the survey area around to the west side of the
gazebo. Although these were two separate
grid blocks, for all practical purposes they
form a single GPR survey grid with a large
square gap where the gazebo sits.
For this GPR survey, each 4-nanosecond­

GPR SURVEY METHODS
Ground-penetrating radar works by trans­
mitting electromagnetic pulses into the ground
from a surface antenna. These pulses are re­
flected off buried objects, features, or bedding
planes and then detected back at the ground
surface with a receiving antenna. The greater
the contrast in electrical, magnetic, and physi­
cal properties between two materials at a bur­
ied interface, the stronger the reflected signal
will be, and therefore the greater the amplitude
of reflected waves. Travel time is measured in
nanoseconds. A series of reflections from each
transect are plotted to create a two-dimensional
profile. Each profile is a graphic representation
of a vertical face along a particular transect (Fig­
ure 3.2).
The success of GPR surveys in archeol­
ogy is largely dependent on soil conditions
such as moisture, depth of burial, and surface
topography and vegetation. Electrically con­
ductive or highly magnetic materials in the
ground, such as wet sediment, quickly dissi­
pate radar energy and prevent its transmis­
sion to depth. The best conditions for energy

thick amplitude slice equals approximately
9.2 cm in the ground. For the six slices shown in
Figure 3.3, the corresponding depths below
ground surface are as follows:
4–8 nanoseconds
8–12 nanoseconds
12–16 nanoseconds
16–20 nanoseconds

RESULTS
This survey identified at least three buried
pipes running through the lawn at different
depths. It shows the presence of a dense natural
stratum that dips toward the southwest.This stra­
tum is visible in Figure 3.3 as a southeast-north­
west trending linear feature that appears in the
northern half of the grid in the shallow slices (12–
16 nanoseconds) and moves toward the southwest
in the deeper slices. The apparent “movement” of
this interface is a function of the way the sloping
surface was “sliced” (Figure 3.4).

Archeological Investigations at the Governor’s Mansion
In Profiles 13 through 18, a clear gap is vis­
ible in the two-dimensional expression of the
buried surface of the natural stratum. This gap
represents some type of intrusive disturbance
or pit that was dug into the underlying stra­
tum. Examined in plan view in Figure 3.3, the
pit into the natural stratum is plainly visible
and may represent the historic privy. Since the
original four-nanosecond slices crosscut the sur­
face into which the pit was excavated, the data
were re-sliced to create an amplitude slice that
combined all of the data from 16 to 24 nanosec­
onds. Figure 3.5 shows the full expression of the
pit into the sloping surface. In this plan view,
the pit appears to be roughly square and mea­
sures between 2.0 and 2.5 m (6.6 to 8.2 ft); the
anomaly is best expressed at between 35 and
55 cm deep. The estimated size of this pit is
slightly smaller than the brick-lined privy pit
that was discovered in 1999 northwest of the
mansion near the carriage house. Blake and
Kibler (1999:16, Figures 8 and 12) report that
this privy pit was square, or possibly rectangu­
lar, and its interior measured 1.55 m from north
to south. When the thickness of the brick-lined
walls are added in, the exterior dimension of this
brick-lined privy box is about 2 m (see Blake and
Kibler 1999:Figure 8).
One additional feature was noted in the
amplitude slice maps between 8 and 12 nano­
seconds (see Figure 3.3). This feature appears
as a weak linear anomaly approximately one
meter wide and 20–30 cm deep. This feature
appears to run from near the southeast corner
of the mansion toward the western side of the
possible privy. The orientation of this linear GPR
anomaly corresponds with an archeological fea­
ture identified as a brick-lined, gravel-paved
walkway (see Feature 13 in Chapter 5). Conse­
quently, it appears that this linear GPR anomaly
represents a continuation of an old walking path
that led from the southeast corner of the man­
sion to the west side of the historic privy.

fined, and this buried stratigraphy provides a
perfect opportunity to prospect for excavated
pits and intrusive features that extend down
into the lower stratum.
One such feature, a roughly square pit mea­
suring between 2.0 and 2.5 m in plan view, was
identified about 5–7 m east of the gazebo. This
pit may represent the subsurface expression of
the historic privy that is reported to have been
in the south lawn (see Figure 1.1). However, if
this feature were a brick-lined privy like the one
found in 1999, one would expect the GPR
anomaly to be much more pronounced. The
anomaly is somewhat ambiguous, and it is ex­
pressed only at certain depths. Consequently, it
is possible that this buried feature was a woodlined privy and that portions of the pit edges
are ill defined due to slumping. Alternatively, if
it was a brick-lined privy, bricks could have been
removed or salvaged when it was abandoned.
Nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century
privies in Texas vary considerably. Privies found
in downtown Houston (Carlson 2002a:17.8–
17.12) and at old Velasco (Earls et al. 1996:136–
138) were typically square or rectangular and
lined with wooden slats or boxes, or they were
round and lined with a wooden barrel. Privies
found at the site of the Alamodome in San An­
tonio included pits that had no lining at all or
were lined with bricks, cut limestone, cedar posts
and other wood, and wooden crates (Brown and
DeLaO 1997:267–269). Privies found in various
archeological projects in Austin show that most
privy pits in the lower economic areas were
square or circular and either unlined or had been
wood lined, with no evidence of the lining sur­
viving (Brown et al. 2003:122–123, 128–129, Feit
et al. 2003:42–5, 62–63, 70–71, 74–76, 96–99).
Given the variations in construction, age, burial
environment, and postdepositional distur­
bances, privy pits may be well preserved and
easy to identify or poorly preserved and diffi­
cult to identify. These factors would obviously
affect how detectable such features would be to
various types of remote sensing instruments.
Another related anomaly, visible only in
shallow amplitude slices, probably represents
a walking path that began near the southeast
corner of the mansion and extended south­
ward to the western side of the possible privy.
The orientation and width of this linear
anomaly appear to correspond with buried
evidence of a brick-edged gravel pathway

SUMMARY
In addition to identifying several buried
pipes that cross the lawn, the GPR survey con­
ducted at the Governor’s Mansion mapped a
dense, natural gravelly stratum that underlies
the mansion and slopes toward the southwest.
The contact between the overlying topsoil and
the underlying dense gravel stratum is well de­

evidence of early occupations and activities at

southeast corner of the mansion.
Without further testing, it is impossible to
know for sure whether the large square GPR
anomaly is indeed a historic privy pit. Careful
hand excavation would be needed to determine
if this is a privy and to document its use and
abandonment. If the feature is a privy, archeo­
logical excavations might yield historic artifacts

ARTIFACTS AND SAMPLES

4

MORTAR, PLASTER, AND
SEDIMENT SAMPLES

This chapter describes the historic artifacts
as well as samples of mortar, plaster, and sedi­
ment recovered from the Governor’s Mansion
during the archeological monitoring for the De­
ferred Maintenance Project. Bricks are given
special attention here because they were the
most abundant type of artifact encountered and
because the identification of the brick types pro­
vides important evidence for interpreting the
construction period of many of the features. The
recovered artifacts and samples are described
further in the discussions of various cultural
features in Chapter 5.

Table 4.2 lists basic descriptive data for the
mortar, plaster, and sediment samples that were
collected from selected locations throughout the
course of the project. The mortar and plaster
samples were taken from structural elements
such as brick walls of existing structures, rem­
nants of old brick walls, or brick-walled features
such as cisterns. The mortar samples were ex­
amined and compared in an attempt to help
define the ages of structures and features and
to determine if there are definable changes in
the types of structural mortar used on the man­
sion grounds over the past 150 years. Samples
associated with particular features are de­
scribed in more detail in Chapter 5.
Sediment samples were collected when a
field examination and description was not suf­
ficient and a more thorough examination was
needed. Most of the sediment samples are asso­
ciated with features, and the sample locations
were specifically selected because they provide
evidence of how certain features or improve­
ments were constructed, how they were modi­
fied through time, or what happened when they
were abandoned.
Unfortunately, due to fiscal constraints for
this project, no detailed compositional or grainsize analyses have been conducted on the many
samples associated with the cultural features.
The mortar samples are particularly interest­
ing and warrant additional study. However, the
mortar samples, as well as mortar that was ob­
served but not sampled, may be divided into two
basic types. One is a sandy mortar that is rela­
tively soft and can be scratched with fingernails.
Most of the mortar samples are of this type. The

HISTORIC ARTIFACTS
Historic artifacts were collected from 8 of
the 11 investigation areas. Artifacts were abun­
dant in the larger excavation areas, especially
where extensively disturbed sediments were
observed, but were rare or absent in other ar­
eas. Table 4.1 lists the artifacts recovered by
investigation area and feature.
Few of the recovered artifacts were found
in situ within intact deposits. In most excava­
tion areas, the upper few feet of sediments was
previously disturbed. Many of the archeologi­
cal investigation areas had been dug up and
backfilled many times. This was especially true
of Area 1, where a large number of underground
utilities enter the mansion, and excavations
exposed a bewildering array of utility lines and
jumbled sediment. Only a very few artifacts
were found in direct association with cultural
features. In most cases, the proximity of arti­
facts to features was simply fortuitous, and the
spatial relationship did not signify any func­
tional or temporal association.

Archeological Investigations at the Governor’s Mansion
soft sandy mortar is associated with all of the
features believed to have been built during the
1854–1856 original mansion construction (e.g.,
Features 3, 10, and 14) and with some other fea­
tures possibly built in the later part of the nine­
teenth century (e.g., Features 2 and 9). The
second type of mortar used to bond bricks to­
gether is a hard concrete mortar. It appears to
be a modern type of Portland cement to which
some type of fine-grained gravels were added
as an aggregate. Only three collected samples
are of this type, but hard concrete mortar was
also observed associated with many other fea­
tures. The hard concrete mortar is associated
with a late-nineteenth or early-twentieth-cen­
tury feature (i.e., the Feature 8 grease trap) and
from basement wall sections (no feature num­
bers) and piers (Feature 15) built during the
1914 mansion renovation period or later.

mon bricks that are virtually identical but with­
out a frog. Type 1 and 2 bricks were found in
many contexts during the archeological moni­
toring, and they associated with many of the
earliest features that were found. Austin Com­
mon bricks are discussed further in Chapter 6.
Small tabular pieces of hand-molded brick
that were formed by breaking Type 1 and Type
2 bricks are categorized as Type 3. The Type 3
specimens were all found in one location (Area
6). They appear to be intentionally broken into
small, flat pieces and may have once been used
as paving stones. Alternatively, it is possible that
these small pieces were intentionally broken off
but that the larger pieces were used elsewhere
and the small pieces were discarded. Notably,
the old grease trap (Feature 8) was constructed
of handmade Type 2 bricks, most broken into
smaller bricks so they would fit in the narrow
wall of a small-diameter cylinder. Similarly,
brick fragments were often used to construct the
shoulders and necks of cisterns for the same
reason.
The other six types are machine-made
bricks representing two different manufactur­
ing processes. Types 4 and 7 are stiff mud-ex­
truded bricks, while Types 5, 6, 8, and 9 are
dry-pressed bricks. The Type 6 bricks, marked
“ABILENE” (see No. 45 illustrated in
Steinbomer 1982:48), were made by the Abilene
Brick Company, which operated in Taylor
County from 1930 to the present, or its prede­
cessor, the Abilene Pressed Brick Company
(1917–1930) (Steinbomer 1980:n.p.). The Type
8 bricks, marked “PALMER” (see No. 195 illus­
trated in Steinbomer 1982:198), were made by
the Palmer Pressed Brick Company, which op­
erated in Ellis County from 1902 to 1929
(Steinbomer 1980:n.p.). The Type 9 bricks,
marked “BUTLER” (see No. 275 in Steinbomer
1982:278), were made by the Butler Brick Com­
pany, which operated in Travis County from
1873 to 1913 (Kleiner 2008; Steinbomer 1980).

BRICK TYPE DESCRIPTIONS
Bricks were the most common type of arti­
fact observed and collected. The specimens that
were collected for subsequent examination and
analysis consist of complete bricks and frag­
ments (see Table 4.1), and other bricks were
observed but not collected. From these speci­
mens, nine distinct types of bricks are defined
based on distinctive attributes (Table 4.3). Fol­
lowing the terminology and classification
scheme described by Gurcke 1987:97–128, this
typology is based first on the method of manu­
facture and second on specific attributes that
distinguish unique types of bricks within the
broad manufacturing categories.
Two types of hand-molded bricks were ob­
served, and they all are similar in color and tex­
ture. Generically called Austin Common bricks
(Mark Denton, personal communication 2008),
these are light-colored bricks (white, pale yel­
low, pale brown, or pink) that have been found
in historic structures all around Austin and are
presumed to have been made locally from Colo­
rado River clays. Type 1 are Austin Common
bricks that have a frog, or rectangular, inden­
tion, on one face.1 Type 2 are plain Austin Com­

1
Frogged bricks are sometimes called “soapdish
bricks” by construction contractors (Tere O’Connell,
personal communication 2009).

ARCHITECTURAL FEATURES

The 15 cultural features found during the
archeological monitoring at the Governor’s Man­
sion are described in this section (see Figure 2.1
and Table 2.2). For discussion purposes, the fea­
tures are organized into five functional groups
and discussed in the following order:

Basement Stairway Wall,
Feature 3
Feature 3 was a section of brick wall associ­
ated with a basement stairway. It was located
in Area 10, the basement expansion area. This
feature was discovered the first time archeolo­
gists entered the basement crawlspace long be­
fore the excavations began to expand the
basement. The entrance to the crawlspace was
at the far southern end of the angled hallway,
where it terminated at a vertical half-wall with
a square opening above it. The opening provided
the only access into the basement crawlspace
that was underneath the floor of the old conser­
vatory room (constructed in 1914 addition). The
wall remnant was observed immediately inside
the crawlspace, and it ran north-south parallel
to, and 3 ft 4 inches west of, the exterior west
wall of the original 1856 mansion. At that time,
Feature 3 was recognized as a section of an old
wall made of hand-molded bricks, and it clearly
had been modified a time or two. In the 1914
renovations, the old wall section had been in­
corporated into the southern end of the angled
basement wall (see Figure 2.6c). What the wall
remnant represented was not obvious at first; it
was only after the basement expansion excava­
tions were completed and the wall remnant was
fully exposed on both the east and west sides
that its age and identity were confirmed.
A complete understanding of the age and
function of Feature 3 wall section would not have
been possible without historic documents. As
various segments of the feature were exposed
over a three-month period, archival documents

were used to help fill in missing information. In
particular, a comparison of historic and modern
maps of the mansion, along with statements
published in Daniel et al. (1984), enabled a con­
fident identification. As described later, the his­
torical evidence leaves little doubt that Feature
3 is a section of the exterior wall that enclosed a
stairway on the back side of the original man­
sion (on the west wall near the southwest cor­
ner). The evidence indicates that the brick wall
section was part of a rectangular stairwell that
housed a staircase going from the ground level
down to the basement. All evidence suggests
that this feature was constructed by 1856 as part
of the original mansion.
Because of where this historic feature was
located, construction plans called for it to be
removed. In consultation with the THC, there
were some discussions about trying to preserve
the old wall section in place, but this was ulti­
mately determined to be impractical given the
project plans and the space needs in the ex­
panded basement. As soon as the feature was
fully exposed and thoroughly documented, the
THC authorized its removal. The excavation
contractors working on the basement expansion
demolished the feature soon afterwards. Some
of the bricks and a sample of the mortar were
collected, and the rest of the old bricks were
stockpiled on the mansion grounds for possible
use in the future.
Feature 3 is best understood by describing
it in conjunction with the feature drawings and
photographs. Figure 5.1 shows plan and profile
views of the feature. Figure 5.2 shows the brick
wall remnant along with an annotated drawing
that explains the various components that il­
lustrate the building sequence.
When the excavation was completed, the
remnant vertical wall section was revealed to
be 9 ft long (north to south), about 7 ft tall, and
varied from 8 to 16 inches wide. It was built of
light-colored hand-molded bricks, commonly
referred to as “Austin Common” bricks (Mark
Denton, personal communication 2008). All of
the loose bricks, as well as some of the in situ
bricks with a portion of a face exposed, had a
rectangular depression, or frog, on one face. This
indicates that they are Type 1 frogged Austin
Common bricks as defined in Chapter 4. While
there could be some Type 2 bricks (without frogs)
incorporated into the wall, it is most likely that
the entire original section of the wall was con­

structed using only Type 1 bricks.
The wall section exhibits many attributes
that provide evidence of various phases of con­
struction and repair. It was probably built in
1856 at the same time as the mansion. One re­
constructed map of the first floor of the original
mansion—the plan by Jim Hendricks in Daniel
et al. (1984:26)—shows the location of this stair­
way along the west wall a short distance north
of the southwest corner of the 1856 mansion (see
Figure 2.6a). In a 1961 interview, Mrs. Stuart
Watt, daughter of Governor and Mrs. James E.
“Ma and Pa” Ferguson, provided information
about the old stairway before and after the 1914
renovations. Mrs. Watt recalled that “Under the
dining room of the main house the old cellar
remained intact with only two changes. Before
the new addition, the cellar had been entered
from a stairway under the back porch, which
was closed with the addition of the conserva­
tory. A new entrance was provided on the south
side with a stairway running up to ground level
near the south exit from the library” (Daniel
et al. 1984:144).
Although there are no definitive records re­
garding the original construction of this stair­
way, the archeological evidence suggests that it
was a rectangular brick-walled stairwell adja­
cent to the west wall of the mansion, and it prob­
ably enclosed a wooden staircase. When the
feature was first built, it appears that a ca. 3­
m-wide ramp was excavated adjacent to the west
wall of the mansion (see Area 1 in Figure 5.2).
The ramp was angled downward to the north at
about 30 degrees, and the original excavation
must have been about 10 ft long and a maxi­
mum of 7 to 8 ft deep from the old ground sur­
face. Once the excavation was completed, bricks
were laid with soft grainy mortar to form verti­
cal walls that would enclose the stairwell. Then
a wooden staircase was probably built inside the
stairwell. The staircase extended from the old
ground level, which is probably about the level
of the bottom of the floor joists of the 1914 con­
servatory room, down the level of the basement
floor.
The excavation for the basement expansion
began with the removal of the vertical 4-ft-high
half-wall at the end of the angled hallway. The
square wooden frame, built of 2x4-inch boards,
was removed from the entrance to the basement
crawlspace. This revealed that the half-wall was
constructed of bricks. The upper fill from just

ing the work, taking photographs, and making
notes pertaining to the construction of the wall
and the nature of the fill behind it.
The fill behind the wall consisted of loosely
compacted material in the upper part, and it
became more compact with depth. The fill was
essentially gravelly clay and sand with a large
amount of construction debris mixed in. The dis­
carded construction materials observed in the
fill included: fragments of cut limestone that
were probably cut from the mansion’s west wall
during one of the renovation phases when base­
ment utilities were added or modified; whole and
fragmentary Type 1 bricks that were probably
removed from the old wall section (described
below); and chunks of old soft mortar. All of the
bricks used in the construction of the half-wall
were Type 5 bricks (dry pressed and perforated
with three holes), and they were mortared to­
gether with hard concrete. The half-wall may
have been built during the 1914 renovations, or
it may represent a later modification that was
made sometime later.
When all of the fill behind the half-wall was
removed, it exposed a sloping ramp of hard grav­
elly fill, which was high on the south end and
dipped downward at about 30 degrees to the
north. On the west side of this area, the intact
lower portion of the old Feature 3 brick wall was
exposed, and it clearly had been constructed fol­
lowing the slope of the ramp.
In the fill area behind the half-wall, some
evidence was found to support the idea that a
wooden staircase was used inside the brickwalled stairwell. This evidence consisted of soil
anomalies found at the bottom of the rubble fill,
and they were intrusive into the hard gravelly
clay ramp. A 2-inch-wide and 4-ft-long linear
depression filled with darker sediment (i.e., an
organic-rich A horizon soil) suggested that a 2­
inch-wide board had been laid into the reddish
brown gravelly clay substrate. It ran north-south
along the inside (west) edge of the old brick wall,
which would have been the west side of the stair­
well. This soil anomaly dipped at the same 30­
degree angle as the excavated ramp.
Excavations along the east side of the stairwell,
adjacent to the exterior of the west wall of origi­

nal mansion, exposed similar evidence that a
2x4-inch board had been set into the reddish
brown gravelly clay following the slope of the
ramp. This soil anomaly was not as well pre­
served or obvious as the one on the west side of
the stairwell, but it was unmistakable near bot­
tom of the ramp. It is likely that these soil
anomalies denote where 2x4-inch boards were
set into the substrate on both sides of the stair­
well to serve as a foundation for attaching a
wooden staircase.
Once the rectangular pit with a ramped floor
was excavated, the next step in the ca. 1856 con­
struction sequence was to build a brick wall to
form the enclosure. Intact portions of this origi­
nal wall were visible from inside basement ex­
pansion area (see Area 2 in Figure 5.2). In
addition, archeologists were able to examine the
interior of this original wall when portions of
the plaster were removed from the hallway be­
hind. Looking at the exterior base of the wall,
the lower seven rows of brick were laid stretcher
(long axis parallel with wall), and the eighth row
was laid header (long axis perpendicular to
wall). Although many of the next rows are par­
tially obscured the exterior side, it is clear that
they were laid stretcher, while the sixteenth row
up from the bottom was again laid header. A
similar pattern was visible when looking at the
interior of the wall after the plaster was re­
moved. From the interior and exterior sides, it
is clear that the bricks in row 23 were laid
header, as were the bricks in row 31, which is
the top row of bricks immediately below the floor
joists. Thus, the brick row pattern was, from
bottom to top: 7 stretcher and 1 header; 7
stretcher and 1 header; 6 stretcher and 1 header;
and 7 stretcher and 1 header. Brick layers call
this pattern, with multiple stretcher rows be­
tween header rows, Common Bond or American
Bond (Gilbreth 1909:209, 226–227, 309).
When looking at the exterior view of the old
wall, the middle sections in the vertical profile
were perplexing at first (see Areas 3 and 4 in
Figure 5.2). Upon final analysis, these zones
represent two additional phases during the
original construction of the stairway wall. As the
basement expansion was in progress, PAI arche­
ologists documented evidence of what appeared
to be a builder’s trench on the west side of the
old brick wall (see Figure 5.1), and the fill in­
side varied considerably. Rather than a true
trench, however, this soil contact actually rep­
57

Archeological Investigations at the Governor’s Mansion
resented the outside edge of the original hole
that was dug for the stairwell. When the hole
was dug, it was slightly larger than the area
needed for the stairwell, and the edge of the pit
was undulating. Because the builders kept the
wall of the stairwell vertical, there was always
a gap between the outside (west edge) of the
stairwell wall and the edge of the pit. The gap
varied in thickness from a few inches to as much
as a foot or more in some places, and different
types of material were used to fill in the gap. In
some places the fill was a dark organic-rich soil,
and in others it was disturbed gravelly clay. Most
notable, however, was the area in the central
portion of the surviving wall remnant, where at
least broken brick fragments and mortar were
dumped in to form a consolidated mass. The
mass of construction material was 2 ft high and
as much as 8 inches thick, and it was still ad­
hering to the brick wall when it was exposed
(see Area 3 in Figure 5.2). Placement of this
material appears to have been quite intentional
and was probably intended to solidify into a firm
base. Immediately above this mass was a 1.5-ft­
tall buttress consisting of seven rows of mor­
tared bricks (see Area 4 in Figure 5.2).
It was at first thought that the rubble zone
and brick buttress were later additions to patch,
repair, or shore up the brick wall. This theory
was later discarded because a careful examina­
tion (especially on the north end of the wall rem­
nant) shows that: (1) all of the bricks in rubble
fill and the buttress are the same as the bricks
in the old wall section; (2) all of the mortar ob­
served in the rubble fill and buttress is the same
soft mortar as in the old wall section; and (3),
finally, the bricks of the buttress were tied into
the original wall, which could only have been
done at the time of the original construction.
The evidence for the latter is that some header
bricks that were mortared in place extended 4
inches into the old wall and 4 inches into the
buttress wall.
The presence of a buttress could mean that
this portion of the wall, about the upper 3 ft,
might have been above ground level when it was
built. Historical evidence indicates that the
stairway was located under the porch of the
original kitchen ell, and the top of the buttress
is only about 16 inches below the bottom of the
floor joists for the existing conservatory. If the
original kitchen ell porch was at the same ap­
proximate level as the floor of the 1914 conser­

vatory, it might have been more or less flush
with the top of the brick wall, perhaps even rest­
ing directly on it. Conversely, if the kitchen ell
porch was at some lower level, some portion of
the stairway brick wall could have been above
the porch level. Notably, the top of the buttress
formed a flat bench that was 8 inches wide and
at least 4 ft long (north-south), and this plat­
form could have been used, perhaps in conjunc­
tion with a wooden pier, to provide additional
support for the floor joists for the old porch. If
this is the case, then the buttress wall section
served the dual functions of providing support
for the porch as well as the masonry stairway
wall.
The next building episode evident in the
Feature 3 remains occurred as part of the 1914
renovations and included destruction of portions
of the stairway and additional construction to
support the new addition to the mansion. As
noted above, when the conservatory was built,
it covered over the old stairway, and a new stair­
way to the basement was added on the south
side of the mansion. However, a portion of the
old stairway wall was left intact during the 1914
renovations, and the old wall was integrated into
the wall of the angled hallway. The 2x12-inch
floor joists of the conservatory floor rested di­
rectly on top of this section of the old stairway
wall. At the south end of the remnant wall, it is
clear that a patch was made to shore up the wall
and provide a framework for the square en­
trance to the basement crawlspace at the end of
the angled hallway. The patched section of bricks
(see Area 5 in Figure 5.2) includes 13 rows of
bricks that are tied into the old wall section.
These bricks included a variety of stiff-mud and
dry-pressed bricks that are much newer than
the Austin Common bricks that were manufac­
tured in the late nineteenth or twentieth centu­
ries (Gurcke 1987:97–111). These bricks are
bonded with a hard concrete mortar, and the
pattern alternates every row between header
and stretcher. This pattern is called the English
Bond (Gilbreth 1909:212, 218–219, 236–239).
This section of the wall may date to the 1914
construction episode, but it also could have been
done sometime later. This section of the wall may
have been built when the eight brick columns
and steel I-beams were added to support the
floor of the conservatory.
When all of the archeological and historical
evidence is taken into account, the location and
58

Chapter 5: Feature Descriptions
design of the Feature 3 brick wall section make
good sense. The interior edge (east side) is neatly
faced, with all of the bricks lined up perfectly to
form a flat vertical face. This was the side of the
wall that would have been visible to anyone who
walked down the stairway to the basement. In
contrast, the exterior face of the old brick wall
is extremely irregular and was not meant to be
aesthetic. No one would ever see this side of the
wall because it either directly abutted the edge
of the pit excavation or abutted fill that was
shoved in between the brick wall and the pit
edge.

be a mortar (i.e., with lime added) but is
extremely friable with almost no cementation.
The wall section is about 8 inches thick. The
lower course of bricks is laid header (north­
south), while the upper course is laid stretcher
(east-west). Scattered brick fragments and loose
gravelly fill rest on the truncated surface of the
wall. These bricks are probably from upper
courses of this wall section, adding support to
the idea that all of the bricks in Feature 10 are
Type 1 Austin Common bricks (see Chapter 4).
The bricks were all placed inside a builder’s
trench, with about 8 inches of gray gravelly sand
placed beneath. This unconsolidated trench fill
provides a strong contrast (in color, texture, and
consistency) with the natural substrate below
it, which is reddish brown, hard gravelly clay.
This sandy gravel in the builder’s trench is simi­
lar to the material sandy fill that was used as
mortar between the bricks.
Historical evidence indicates that Feature
10 is a remnant of the foundation wall for the
porch of the original kitchen ell, which probably
dates to the 1856 construction. The location of
Feature 10 corresponds perfectly with the south
edge of the porch on the old kitchen ell. It is
likely that the trench was excavated and par­
tially filled with a sandy gravel mixture before
several courses of bricks were laid into the
trench. It is not known how many courses there
were originally, but it may be assumed that there
was at least one and perhaps as many as four or
five more courses of brick, depending on the level
of the old porch. A wooden board may have been
laid directly on the brick wall to support the
porch. The sandy gravel fill served as the base
for the brick wall and probably facilitated drain­
age along the dripline of the covered porch.

Remnant of Kitchen Ell
Porch Footing, Feature 10
Feature 10 is a ca. 4-ft-long segment of brick
wall set on a gravelly base inside a builder’s
trench. The feature was located in the far north­
west corner of the basement expansion area (see
Figure 2.5). It was identified and documented
prior to the extensive construction excavations,
but additional documentation was done after the
fill removal made access easier. Because Fea­
ture 10 was located at the far northern end of
the basement expansion area, it was not im­
pacted by the current project. The feature was
left intact, and it is now sealed in just north of
the concrete wall that was added at the north
end of the basement expansion.
As shown in Figure 5.3, the brick wall sec­
tion runs east-west, and it was viewed only in
profile. It is located immediately below the floor
joists of the 1914 expansion, but the floor joists
did not rest on the brick wall. The western end
of the wall segment is truncated by a cut where
the wall and underlying fill were removed for
an electrical conduit (but the conduit had been
removed before the feature was found). The in­
tact wall section extends for about 4 ft, and it
runs behind (north of) one of the Feature 15 brick
piers (Pier H) and behind an air conditioning
duct. It ends abruptly on the east end, where it
was truncated when the wall of the angled hall­
way was added during the 1914 renovations.
The wall segment is composed of old
handmade bricks, and a frog was found on one
of the bricks in the bottom course. This suggests
that the entire wall section is composed of Type
1 bricks. Only two courses of brick remain
intact, with about 2 inches of fill between the
courses. This fill is a sandy gravel, and it may

Brick Piers for
1914 Addition, Feature 15
Eight brick columns were documented in the
basement expansion area (Area 10). The eight
brick columns are summarized in Table 5.1, and
examples are illustrated in Figures 5.4 and 5.5.
These columns were built to serve as piers to
hold up heavy steel I-beams that supported the
floor joists of the 1914 conservatory above. These
support columns are a relatively recent addi­
tion and may have been added when the 1950s
or 1960s heating and air conditioning repairs
were made.

Chapter 5: Feature Descriptions

Archeological Investigations at the Governor’s Mansion
As shown earlier in Figure 2.5, the eight
columns were spaced out across the basement
crawlspace, and they all had to be completely
removed during the excavation to expand the
basement. Collectively, the columns were des­
ignated as Feature 15, and each column was
assigned a letter A through H. Each brick col­
umn was photographed, measured, and de­
scribed individually.
Each pier had between 8 and 11 courses of
bricks, with 1, 3, or 4 bricks per course. The col­
umns ranged in height from 24 to 30 inches, and
each one was constructed with concrete mortar
and attached to the hard-packed gravelly clay
substrate with concrete. With the exception of
three handmade bricks (Type 1 or 2) that were
used for the top row of Column B, all of the bricks
used to build the columns were modern, drypressed, and machine-made.
Three sizes of brick columns were observed.
Two were freestanding 12x12-inch piers, and
four were freestanding 12x8-inch piers. Column
H was a 12x8-inch pier that was cemented
against the northern edge of the basement
crawlspace, and part of it abuts Feature 10 (see
Figure 5.3). Column D was a 8x4-inch pier at­
tached to the south wall of the 1914 addition.
Notably, the most recent construction episode,
the replacement of a section at the southern end
of the old wall remnant with modern bricks (see
Area 5 in Figure 5.2), appears to have served
three purposes. It appears to have terminated
the basement wall, formed the west side of the
frame for the crawlspace entrance, and been a
support pier for the floor above. The machinemade bricks and concrete mortar used in this
wall segment are identical to those used in the
Feature 15 piers.

the front entrance to the property (see Figure
2.1 and Table 2.2). The feature was encountered
when the plumbing crew was trying to locate a
buried sewer pipe and possible manhole near
Colorado Street. Lines running east-west across
the Colorado Street pavement showed the loca­
tion of a cut where buried sewer pipe went un­
der the street. The plumbers selected the test
area to search for the sewer pipe (and a pre­
sumed manhole location) to the west of this cut
and just inside the brick and iron perimeter
fence. Excavation began with the backhoe, but
when the backhoe hit the first limestone slabs,
mechanical digging was abandoned near the
feature. Subsequent hand excavations exposed
an east-west alignment of limestone rocks (see
Figure 2.3). The plumbers continued machine
excavations in the area north of the wall and
eventually found the buried sewer pipe at a
depth of ca. 6 ft below surface.
The exposed portion of the rock wall mea­
sured 5 ft 1 inch long (east-west) by 1 ft 8 inches
wide (north-south), with a neatly faced edge on
the north and a rough southern edge (Figure
5.6). Several limestone slabs were found in the
area just south of the wall. A few were oriented
vertically and had obviously once been part of
the wall. These dislocated rocks indicate that
the upper part of the feature was disturbed and
that the rocks were most likely displaced or dis­
carded when the rock wall was abandoned.
During the investigation of the rock wall, a
single row of bricks was exposed running north­
ward from the western end of the rock wall. The
alignment runs due north of the westernmost
brick gate columns on the east entrance. It con­
sists of a single course of dry-laid brick, which
is set into the earth and intentionally laid
stretcher (end to end) and on edge. At first, only
two aligned bricks were observed adjacent to the
wall, and a third brick was displaced. All three
were hand-molded Type 1 Austin Common
bricks. As the excavation was expanded to the
north to search for the sewer pipe, more aligned
bricks were exposed, but the line was not con­
tinuous. After cleaning and examining the en­
tire excavation, it became obvious that there had
been a single row of aligned bricks, but that a
long segment was damaged in the initial back­
hoe trenching and by the original plumbing
trench in which the sewer pipe was laid. The
plumbing trench was easily visible in the west
wall of the excavation, and the top of the sewer

hoe disturbance and the sewer pipe trench
had bisected the alignment, and the 3-ft sec­
tion of aligned bricks and brick impressions.
The total length of the alignment, then, was
about 11 ft 6 inches. The alignment still con­
tinued at the north end, and more of this brick
alignment presumably remains intact and
buried to the north.
Collectively, the limestone rock wall and the
single row brick alignment represent landscap­
ing features. It is likely that the neatly faced
north edge of the large limestone wall was vis­
ible, while the wall’s ragged south edge was hid­

bricks had been (one 7 1/2-inches-long frogged
impression and one 8 inches long), one par­
tial brick, one complete 8-inch-long brick, and
a partial brick extending into the north wall
of the excavation. The three bricks were all
hand-molded Austin Common bricks, but
since they were left in place, it is not known
if they were Type 1 or 2.

den by earthen fill. Thus, it was probably an
ornamental rock wall perhaps associated with
a stairway near the front entrance or a raised
planter box along the front side of the mansion.
The alignment of old handmade Austin Com­
mon bricks (including Type 1) abuts the lime­
stone wall and had to have been put in place
after the wall was constructed. This suggests
that this feature is rather old and was probably
built sometime in the latter half of the nine­
teenth century. Another important observation
is that many of the old bricks in the alignment
are slightly misshapen or fragmentary, suggest­
ing that the best bricks were used in structures
while the irregular and broken ones were used
for landscaping.
After Feature 2 was documented with plan
and profile drawings, photographs, and written
descriptions, the rock wall was covered with
plastic for protection. Plumbing excavations con­
tinued digging deeper in the area north of the
rock wall, and the old sewer pipe was eventu­
ally fully exposed. The fill removed from north
of the rock wall was used to fill in the excava­
tion on the south side of the wall. Area 2 re­
mained open for the remainder of the project
but was eventually backfilled, and Feature 2
remains intact.

This gravel lens, buried by 9 to 12 inches of soil,
dips slightly and gently through the center of
Feature 11. Fill beneath the gravel lens is simi­
lar, although slightly more compact, than that
above the gravel lens. Both observations sug­
gest that the lower portion of the pit was filled
in and packed before the gravel was spread
across the lawn.
Historic photographs suggest that Feature
11 may be the location of a decorative garden
fountain. Photographs from 1888 and the 1890s
show at least two different fountains located
southeast of the mansion in the south lawn. The
1888 photograph (Daniel et al. 1984:101, 109)
shows a three-tiered decorative fountain close
to the mansion, and the 1890s photograph
(Daniel et al. 1984:121) shows a similar (but
perhaps two-tiered) fountain in the same ap­
proximate area as Feature 11. A water fountain
on the mansion grounds is mentioned in an 1877
Austin Statesman newspaper article, and hy­
drants were installed at the same time for wa­
tering the garden and shrubbery (Daniel et al.
1984:101). Fountains also are mentioned as be­
ing on the mansion grounds in 1883 and 1901
(Daniel et al. 1984:108, 132).
Circumstantial archeological evidence fur­
ther supports the idea that this basin-shaped
depression is the remnant of a fountain. The
gravel lens observed along the water line trench
is thickest (as much as 2½ inches thick) about
7 ft beyond the western extent of the pit, be­
tween the northwest edge and the northern pipe.
The gravel lens decreases in thickness and dis­
appears about 9 ft beyond the southeast edge of
the pit. These gravelly deposits may represent
dispersed remnants of gravel walking paths that
went to and around the fountain. A 1½-inch­
diameter cast-iron pipe runs east to west across
the water line trench about 5 ft 1 inch south­
east of the eastern edge of the pit feature. A
2-inch-diameter cast-iron pipe runs west-south­
west to east-northeast, crossing the water line
trench about 5 ft 9 inches north-northwest of
the western edge of the Feature 11 pit. These
old cast-iron pipes may have been part of a net­
work that supplied water to the fountain and
nearby garden areas.
Another possible interpretation is that Fea­
ture 11 represents the location of the original
gazebo built at the mansion in the early 1870s
during the Davis administration (Daniel et al.
1984:92, 130–131; Friends of the Governor’s

Possible Fountain
Location, Feature 11
A clearly defined pit feature was exposed
midway along the northwest-southeast sec­
tion of the water line trench excavated in Area
4 (see Table 2.2 and Figure 2.4). The feature
is an intrusive pit that extends ca. 9 ft 9
inches northeast to southwest along the west
wall of the water line trench. The pit was also
observed in the east wall profile, but this ex­
posure extends laterally for only 7 ft 5 inches.
The pit bottom reaches a depth of 9 inches
below surface in west profile and 14 inches
deep in the east profile.
The sides of the pit are clearly defined by
the contrast between the pit fill and the natu­
ral subsoil, but the base of the pit is slightly less
well defined. The pit fill consists of mottled sedi­
ment with strong brown and light grayish brown
intermixed with very dark brown clay loam. The
buried gravel lens observed in many places along
the 60-foot-long water line trench was also ob­
served in association with the Feature 11 pit.

Archeological Investigations at the Governor’s Mansion
Mansion 1997:84, 87). Two historic photographs
show the gazebo located between the southeast
corner of the mansion and the southeast corner
of the mansion block. One is a ca. 1874 photo­
graph published by Daniel et al. (1984:93), and
the other is ca. 1889 photograph published by
Friends of the Governor’s Mansion (1997:84).
These photographs suggest that Feature 11
could be in the vicinity of the old gazebo, al­
though more study would be needed to confirm
this interpretation. Notably, the gazebo does not
appear in a ca. 1890s photograph published by
Daniel et al. (1984:121).

Brick-Lined Gravel Walkway,
Feature 13
Feature 13 is a brick-lined gravel walkway
that was first identified in the water line trench
excavated in Area 4 (see Table 2.2 and Figure
2.4). The feature is located south of the mansion’s
front porch and immediately south of the mod­
ern east-west brick walkway. The walkway runs
northwest-southeast, but only a small portion
of it was exposed.
Plumbers found this feature while burrow­
ing a tunnel under the modern brick walkway.
This tunnel was for the water pipe to be fed
underneath the brick walkway as it approached
the mansion. The plumbers found two bricks laid
end to end and notified the PAI archeologist
working onsite. The archeologist then expanded
the excavation to expose five bricks laid end to
end, forming a line at least 4 ft long extending
southwest from the existing red-brick walkway.
All were hand-molded Type 1 bricks, but they
were irregular sizes ranging from 5½ to 7 inches
in length. A packed lens of pea-sized limestone
gravels was found north of the brick alignment.
This gravel lens extended at least 5 ft east-west,
but the exploratory excavation had to be halted
because it encroached into the canopy of a large
oak tree.
The aligned bricks and the gravel lens were
found at depth of 9 to 13 inches below surface.
On the southwest end, the feature is truncated
by an old trench with a buried 2-inch PVC pipe.
An exploratory shovel probe was excavated on
the southwest side of the PVC pipe to see if the
feature continued. No bricks were found, but the
gravel lens was present and consistent with that
found to the northeast. The plumbers found two
additional bricks as they dug underneath the
existing brick walkway, indicating that a por­
tion of this brick-lined gravel walkway is intact
underneath the modern walkway.
This feature is interpreted as a brick-lined,
gravel-filled walkway. A possible walkway was
identified by the GPR survey and may repre­
sent the southern extent of Feature 13 (see Fig­
ure 2.4). The walkway may have once led to a
gate in a fence that ran north-south and divided
the south lawn. This fence is visible in mansion
photographs from 1866 and 1870, as well as in
an 1873 sketch of the Governor’s Mansion
(Daniel et al. 1984:86, 91, 95). The walkway may
also have led to the privy on the south lawn,

Gravel Walkway, Feature 12
Feature 12 is a thin but distinct lens of sand
and small gravel identified in the water line
trench in Area 4 (see Table 2.2 and Figure 2.4).
The feature is located southeast of the mansion’s
front porch and about 5 ft south of the modern
east-west brick walkway. The water line trench
exposed approximately 7 to 9 inches of topsoil
throughout the majority of the trench, and in
this location there was a concentration of coarsegrain sand mixed with small (less than 1 inch)
gravels covered by 10 to 12 inches of topsoil. This
lens was 3 to 3½ inches thick and extended hori­
zontally for approximately 3 ft.
The feature is interpreted as a sand and
gravel walkway, but the concentration is not
sufficient to suggest that an old walkway was
buried intact. The feature appears to be dis­
turbed to some degree, and it is likely that the
sandy gravels were dispersed when the lawn was
leveled and topsoil was added. It is not known
when this disturbance occurred, but there have
been many landscaping episodes when more
topsoil could have been added.
Historical evidence suggests that there were
indeed sand and gravel walkways on the
mansion’s south lawn. Many additions and up­
grades were made to the mansion grounds in
1871, for example, and many supplies were pur­
chased for building the gazebo, garden house,
and extensive landscaping (see Table 1.2).
Daniel et al. (1984:92) note that “twelve loads
of gravel and sand” were purchased for the man­
sion and that at least one old photograph of the
gazebo “shows a gravel path running across the
front yard to the quaint structure on the south
lawn.”

68

Chapter 5: Feature Descriptions
and it is notable that Daniel et al. (1984:92)
mentions an old photograph that “shows a gravel
path running across the front lawn to the quaint
structure [referring to the gazebo] on the south
lawn.” As discussed earlier with regard to the
ground-penetrating radar survey to search for
the possible privy location (see Chapter 3), an
1890s photograph shows a small structure in
the south lawn that may be the location of the
privy (Daniel et al. 1984:121).

existed there. At this point, PAI and THC ar­
cheologists were considering the possibility that
the historical evidence used by the architects to
plot the cistern on the west side of the mansion
were simply plans and that, for whatever rea­
son, the cistern actually got built on the north
side of the mansion.
Then, in the final days of work on the base­
ment expansion, the excavation contractors dis­
covered the lost cistern. While they were digging
to pour the final concrete footings beneath the
foundation of the west wall of the 1914 addi­
tion, they discovered the intact, curved brick
wall of the old cistern. The missing cistern had
been found, but it was located some 10 to 15 ft
farther west than the cistern locations drawn
by previous architects. It was not until some­
time after the second cistern was found that PAI
archeologists discovered that Daniel et al.
(1984:114) had cited a state document referring
to “cisterns” at the mansion in 1888.

CISTERNS
Cisterns were used primarily for water
catchment and storage, and they were the most
feasible source of water for the Governor’s Man­
sion up until sometime after the early 1870s,
which is when Austin contracted a water utility
company to create a city water system (Daniel
et al. 1984:92). Cisterns also were used for cool­
ing food prior to the availability of refrigeration.
“Cistern houses and cooling troughs in outbuild­
ings were the only way to keep food moderately
cool” (McQueary 2003:10). The first mention of
refrigeration being at the mansion occurred in
about 1933 (Daniel et al. 1984:169, 181, 325).
Going into the Deferred Maintenance
Project, PAI archeologists knew there was a pos­
sibility of encountering a cistern during the ar­
cheological monitoring. A cistern is mentioned
in official state records, and at least two mod­
ern architects have drawn plans of the original
mansion that show a cistern or a cistern house
on the back side of the mansion (Daniel et al.
1984:26, 38). As events unfolded, however, two
underground cisterns were found during the
archeological monitoring, and both turned out
to be surprises.
The first cistern was found in the north
lawn, and its discovery was totally unexpected.
No historic documents suggested that a cistern
might have been located anywhere near this
spot. On the other hand, historical evidence
showed that there had been a cistern located on
the back side of the original mansion, and PAI
archeologists expected to find evidence of this
feature in the basement expansion area. But
when the digging for the basement expansion
was almost completed, no cistern had been
found. In fact, the gravelly clay throughout the
basement expansion area was unquestionably
intact and undisturbed, which precluded the
possibility that any type of intrusive feature had

North Cistern, Feature 9
Plumbers digging and following old utility
lines in the extensively disturbed deposits in
Area 1 encountered a portion of a curved brick
wall in early April 2008. A little more excava­
tion revealed that it was curved horizontally, but
also curved vertically. It soon became apparent
that it was an intact brick-lined cistern. Over
the next several weeks, excavations continued
in Area 1 until a significant portion of the south­
ern half of the cistern was exposed (Figure 5.7).
It is a bottle-shaped cistern constructed of handmolded Austin Common bricks held together
with soft, sandy mortar. Because the feature was
completely intact and no brick faces were vis­
ible, it is not clear whether they are Type 1
frogged bricks or Type 2 plain bricks.
At the top of the cistern was a 20-inch-di­
ameter cast-iron lid with a small circular ring
welded to the center of the lid. An oval-shaped
ring runs through the welded ring; it once served
as the swivel handle for lifting the lid. The
handle ring no longer functioned because it had
become welded in place by rust. The lid sat atop
a 30-inch-wide and 6-inch-high iron ring that
had been set into concrete, and a level concrete
pad had been formed at the base of the iron ring.
The concrete pad rests directly on top of the
cistern’s brick wall. It is clear from this configu­
ration that the original neck of the cistern was

modified, and perhaps some portion of it was
removed, when the concrete pad, iron ring, and
circular lid were added. This modification prob­
ably occurred at the time the cistern was aban­
doned. These alterations to the neck of the
cistern, as well as the extensive disturbances of
the upper few feet of fill all around the cistern,
could have obliterated evidence of inflow pipes
or overflow pipes that might have entered or
exited through the neck near the original ground
level.

When the cast-iron lid was first removed, it
exposed the ca. 18-inch-diameter opening in the
metal ring that forms the cistern’s mouth. Upon
close inspection, the cistern’s interior was found
to be completely intact, and the cavity was empty
except for a small amount of sediment across
the bottom and an unusual set of plumbing fea­
tures (Figure 5.8). A metal water pipe with a
cutoff valve attached was oriented vertically
inside the cistern’s neck. Deeper inside, it had a

70

Chapter 5: Feature Descriptions
90-degree bend and appeared to be attached to
a long metal box that was set against the
cistern’s east wall. It was hypothesized that the
pipe and metal box were some type of water
pump and/or filtration system.
After many discussions regarding safety is­
sues, it was decided that someone would be al­
lowed to enter the cistern if all OSHA safety
procedures were followed. After an appropriate
safety orientation, a PAI archeologist was fit­
ted with a safety harness and entered the cis­
tern using a narrow ladder. The ladder was then
removed. The archeologist spent about two
hours inside, with an air quality monitor present
during the entire time. This allowed for a de­
tailed inspection to document the cistern’s inte­
rior and the unusual plumbing features inside.

The cistern’s entire interior cavity is covered
with a gray granular material that is relatively
hard in comparison to the soft, sandy mortar
bonding the bricks together. This material ap­
pears to be a sandy cement, and it was undoubt­
edly added as a plaster coating intended to make
the cistern leak-proof. The plaster coating was
completely intact except for a few horizontal
cracks along the shoulder, and small rootlets had
grown through in some areas. It is not known if
this represents the cistern’s original plastered
interior, but there was only one small area on
the west wall where it appeared that additional
plaster had been added. There was no evidence
of multiple plaster layers, indicating that there
had been significant repair or replastering epi­
sodes. On the inside of the neck, about 3 to 6

71

Archeological Investigations at the Governor’s Mansion
inches from the top, a break in the plastered
surface exposed the bricks underneath. At this
point there was only a single layer of portland
cement plaster about ½ inch thick.
At the bottom of the cistern, a small
amount of sediment formed a talus cone that
was deepest in the center and shallower
around the edges. Hand-excavated tests were
dug in the center and at the base of the metal
pump box attached to the east wall, and both
exposed the well-plastered floor of the cistern.
These tests revealed that the talus cone was
composed exclusively of a mottled reddish
brown gravelly clay identical to the natural
gravelly clay substrate observed in many ar­
eas on the mansion grounds. The talus cone
represents a deposit formed by materials fall­
ing in or being thrown in from the top of the
open cistern, but no artifacts were observed
in the excavated samples of fill. A fine-grained
sediment that exhibited drying cracks was
present along the edges of the cistern. This
material is homogenous gray clay that prob­
ably washed in as water leaked inside from
the top of the cistern after it had been capped
and buried. When the cistern top was first
removed, small plant rootlets hanging down
around the edges of the cistern mouth indi­
cated that water had occasionally seeped in
from the top. At the time the cistern’s inte­
rior was inspected, the sediment at the bot­
tom was moist but not wet.
Figure 5.9 is a profile drawing that illus­
trates the overall shape of the North Cistern
and the interior plumbing features. The cistern
is 10 ft 1 inch tall on the outside, but its interior
depth is 9 ft 4 inches. The brick walls gently
taper outward from the mouth to about 5 ft be­
low the lid, at which point the side walls become
more or less vertical to the bottom of the cis­
tern. The overall shape is that of a bottle, but
the North Cistern has gently inward sloping
shoulders rather than the high rounded shoul­
ders often seen in cistern profiles. The bottom
interior of the cistern is essentially flat.
During most of the time that the cistern’s
south side was exposed in the plumbing exca­
vation, only the upper 5 to 6 ft was exposed. Near
the end of the period it was being investigated,
the plumbers needed to expose a pipe at the
deepest part of the manhole, so they dug a test
excavation along the south side of the cistern’s
belly to expose a portion of the brick wall all the

way to the bottom of the cistern. This test re­
vealed that the cistern’s exterior depth is 10 ft
1 inch below its mouth. A sample of reddish sand
with fine gravels was collected from immediately
below the bottom bricks. It appears that this
material represents a prepared base material
probably used to create a level sandy surface
onto which the first layer of bricks was set and
mortared. The cistern walls are approximately
8 to 9 inches thick, or about the thickness of one
8-inch-long brick. The pattern of brick orienta­
tion seen on the exterior shows that most courses
are comprised of two parallel bricks laid
stretcher (only the outside one is visible), with
occasional courses of bricks laid header. In a few
places, short sections of header bricks are
present within a course of stretcher bricks. There
was not a discernible pattern of header and
stretcher rows as was observed for the West Cis­
tern (see Feature 14).
When the interior inspection was made,
it became clear that the water pipe and
plumbing features along the cistern’s east
wall were components from some type of wa­
ter pumping and possible filtration system
(see Figures 5.8 and 5.9). The vertical elon­
gated box attached to the east wall served as
an intake tube to extract water from the lower
portion of the cistern, but not off the bottom.
This plumbing mechanism is described here
from the top down, and all depth measure­
ments are from the top of the metal ring that
forms the cistern’s mouth. The water pipe is
a ferrous metal, and its upper part is oriented
vertically in the east half of the cistern’s
mouth. The top of the pipe was severed with
a clean cut, presumably cut with a metal saw
when the cistern was abandoned and capped
with the cast-iron lid. The top of the pipe is
about 1 ft below the top, and there a distinct
6-inch-long impression of the pipe was ob­
served in the interior plaster along the north­
east side of the neck. The pipe had clearly
come up through the cistern’s mouth at this
point, and was presumably attached to a
pump somewhere above. At about 1 ft 6 inches
from the top, a brass cutoff valve was present
on the vertical water line. The valve was fro­
zen in the off position (perpendicular to the
line). The valve is identical to one illustrated
in an 1888 pump and hydraulic machinery
catalog (Figure 575 in Goulds Manufacturing
Company 1988:216). The line continues down­

ward to 4 ft 8 inches from the top, at which
point there is a right angle fitting and the line
turns and runs eastward for 2 ft 3 inches. In­
side a 12-inch-wide and 8-inch tall nook (or
cutout) in the cistern wall, the water line has
another right angle fitting and turns down­
ward for about 3 inches, where it attaches to
the vertical intake box.
The intake box is a ferrous metal structure
that is 4 ft tall and 6 inches wide. Its back side
is inset into the cistern wall, and the portland
cement plaster laps up onto the edges on all
sides. The last plastering episode clearly oc­
curred after this structure was installed. The
bottom portion (about 1 ft 3 inches) of the struc­
ture is rectangular and was inset into a 4-inch­
tall raised platform that is about 12 by 12 inches
and neatly plastered with a sandy portland ce­
ment. The upper portion (about 2 ft 9 inches) of
the structure extends out from the wall from 6
inches (top) to 9 inches (bottom), and the out­
side edges are rounded. Looking back up the
structure from the bottom, an extensively cor­
roded D-shaped opening (about 4x5 inches) runs
the full length of this section. It appears to make
a right angle turn at the top of the structure.
It is strongly suspected that the plumbing
features inside the North Cistern were installed
at the time the cistern was built, and that the
metal structure represents some type of filtra­
tion system. It is likely that some portion of the
device is missing. It may be that a D-shaped
insert that housed a filter was once inside the
vertical structure. Alternatively, a square or cy­
lindrical filter box might have sat on top of the
plastered square platform and fit snugly against
the bottom of the intake tube. Either configura­
tion would allow for a filter, most likely using
charcoal, to be replaced periodically when the
cistern was cleaned. A quick search of online
patents indicates that a large number and wide
variety of cistern filters were patented in the
late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
The North Cistern has an interior cylinder
measuring about 100 inches (8.3 ft) deep from
the bottom of the neck and a maximum of 72
inches (6 ft) wide, so the volume of complete cyl­
inder is calculated to be 407,150 cubic inches,
or 1,763 gallons. Using a 15 to 20 percent re­
duction to allow for the fact that the cylinder
tapers considerably, the actual capacity of the
North Cistern is estimated to be about 1,411 to
1,499 gallons.

West Cistern, Feature 14
Prior to excavations, research conducted by
Volz and Associates indicated that a cistern was
located in the back of the original mansion, south
of the kitchen ell and west of the mansion wall.
An overlay map was created that showed two
probable locations of the cistern based on the
architectural drawings by Jim Hendricks and
August Watkins Harris (see Figures 2.6a and
2.6b). A preliminary reconnaissance of the base­
ment expansion area was conducted long before
the digging crews began excavations in this area,
in case the cistern would alter plans. The recon­
naissance resulted in the identification of two
features, Feature 3 (the wall of the original base­
ment staircase) and Feature 10 (the kitchen ell
porch footing), but no sign of a cistern or distur­
bance of that magnitude was found.
Excavation contractors discovered the cis­
tern after they had removed the entire fill in
the basement expansion area and while they
were digging out a few feet of sediment from
underneath the west wall of the 1914 addition.
As they dug the area where they intended to
pour a massive concrete footing to shore up the
west wall foundation, they discovered and ex­
posed a 6-ft-wide section of the curved belly of
the east wall of a brick-lined cistern. The
cistern’s east wall was recorded and photo­
graphed while the excavation crew continued
to prepare the concrete forms for the basement
walls and footings (Figure 5.10). Portions of the
lower concrete walls to the north and south of
the cistern were poured and allowed to set, then
PAI archeologists directed additional excava­
tions along the edge of the feature to expose as
much of its east wall as possible. The excava­
tions extended to a depth of more than 13 ft
below the basement ceiling, but the bottom out­
side edge of the cistern was not found. PAI ar­
cheologists then took more photographs and
drew plan and profile maps of the cistern (Fig­
ure 5.11). Once the archeological documentation
was completed, the construction contractors
added the rebar reinforcement and poured con­
crete to fill in the lower basement wall section.
Plastic sheeting was placed against the cistern
wall to protect it, but the new concrete wall
sealed in the cistern once again. Since most of
the cistern is underneath the current porch area
(built in 1914), it is presumed that the cistern is
essentially intact.

Chapter 5: Feature Descriptions
the actual minimum capacity of the West Cis­
tern is estimated to be about 7,148 to 7,595 gal­
lons. If this cistern is much deeper, it could easily
have been a 10,000-gallon cistern.

For descriptive purposes in this section, the
baseline for depth measurements is the bottom
of the 9x2-inch floor joists of the 1914 conserva­
tory (see Figure 2.6c). It is assumed that before
the 1914 renovations, the original ground sur­
face was at about the same elevation as this
baseline, within a foot or so.
The cistern’s exterior east wall extends down
at least 13 ft 6 inches. The excavations in this
area had to be terminated for safety reasons, so
the exterior base of the cistern was not identi­
fied. It is likely that the cistern extends a little
further, but probably not more than a foot or
two. The maximum diameter of the cistern can
be calculated by mapping the curvature of the
cistern’s belly in plan view and extending the
arc. The exterior diameter is estimated to be
12 ft 6 inches (with an error of less than plus or
minus 12 inches). At the direction of the PAI
archeologists, a hole was drilled through the
cistern’s wall to determine the thickness of the
wall and the nature of the fill. It was presumed
that the cistern was filled in during the 1914
renovation work, but there was no way of know­
ing without drilling into the cistern’s interior.
The drill hole revealed that the cistern’s brick
wall was about 9 inches thick, indicating that
its walls were 1-brick-length thick, as was ob­
served for the North Cistern. Based on the ex­
terior diameter and wall thickness, the interior
diameter of the West Cistern is estimated to be
about 11 ft 6 inches.
The pattern of how the bricks were arranged
was evident only in a 6x3-ft section of the wall
along the upper body and shoulder of the cis­
tern. The cistern walls below this were obscured
by a rough layer of mortar and rubble that had
been laid directly against the cylindrical pit edge
when the cistern was constructed. Most of the
bricks in the cistern wall were laid header, but
some courses of header bricks had sections
where two to four bricks were laid stretcher. The
pattern was not as formal as was observed in
the 1856 stairway wall (see Feature 2), but it
appears that the occasional sections of stretcher
bricks served to strengthen the wall.
The West Cistern has an interior cylinder
that is estimated to be at least 138 inches
(11.5 ft) deep excluding the neck and 138 inches
(11.5 ft) wide, so the volume of cylinder is calcu­
lated to be 2,064,082 cubic inches, or 8,935 gal­
lons. Using a 15 to 20 percent reduction to allow
for the fact that cylinder tapers at the shoulder,

PLUMBING FEATURES
Plumbing features encountered at the
Governor’s Mansion consist of two manholes
(Features 1 and 4) and a grease trap (Feature
8). All three features were found Area 1 north
of the 1914 addition (see Figure 2.2). As de­
scribed earlier in Chapter 2, Area 1 was a con­
fusing location because of the extensive
disturbances due to buried utility lines (sewer,
water, electrical, security) and numerous im­
provements over the years.
Large Manhole, Feature 1
Feature 1 was first exposed as a 45-inch­
square concrete platform a few inches below
ground surface in Area 1 (see Table 2.2 and Fig­
ure 2.1). The feature is a manhole to access a
deeply buried sewer line, and it spans 21 ft 9
inches to 25 ft 7 inches from the north wall of
the 1914 addition. When the plumbers encoun­
tered the feature, it was assumed to be a man­
hole for the sewer system. Subsequent
excavations and examination revealed that the
feature was completely intact, and it was left in
place to continue functioning as a sewer man­
hole.
The square concrete platform has a 29-inch­
square cast-iron plate set into the concrete and
a 24½-inch-square removable cast-iron lid with
an impressed checkerboard grid pattern. This
lid has a 4½-inch C-shaped ring attached to its
center with two ¾-inch nuts on the bottom side
of the plate. The ring serves as the handle for
the lid. When the lid was removed, it exposed a
22¾-inch-square opening in the concrete box.
The square concrete platform is about 6 inches
thick, and below it is a concrete cylinder with
an interior diameter of 3 ft ½ inch. The inside of
the cylinder is 9 ft 6 inches deep from the top of
the concrete box, and it had at least two waste­
water lines entering it a different levels. At 30
inches below the top on the north side, a sewage
pipe from the carriage house enters the man­
hole. A second pipe at the bottom of the feature,
about 9 ft below the top, enters from the south
to bring sewage from the mansion.
77

Archeological Investigations at the Governor’s Mansion
The surface of Feature 1 was exposed early
on in the Area 1 investigations, and continued
excavations eventually exposed a large portion
of the south and southwest exterior sides. The
feature remained exposed until a new grease
trap was installed and PVC pipes connected the
grease trap to the sewer manhole (see Figure
5.7). Once the new grease trap was in place,
Area 1 was filled with sand and topsoil, and

and buried with sand when work in Area 1 was
completed. The age of the Feature 4 manhole is
uncertain, but it most likely postdates 1914. It
was probably installed in conjunction with the
1914 mansion renovation work, although it
could have been built anytime during the first
half of the twentieth century.
Grease Trap, Feature 8
A brick grease trap was exposed in the
south-central portion of Area 1 (see Table 2.2
and Figure 2.1). While digging with the small
backhoe in Area 1, several loose bricks with hard
concrete mortar were first encountered, and
then an intact brick wall section was found.
Hand excavations exposed a circular brick wall
composed of hand-molded Type 2 bricks (plain
with no frog) that were bonded with hard con­
crete mortar.
During the 2008 monitoring work, it was
discovered that this feature was first found when
the Dectron PVC line for heating/AC ventila­
tion was installed in 2005. Sherry Allsup with
the Texas State Preservation Board informed
PAI archeologists of this and described what she
remembered seeing in 2005. She also provided
a photograph that confirmed that the feature
she recalled was the same one encountered in
2005. It was described as being a brick-walled
cylinder that was 6 ft deep. The cylinder was
empty except for a small amount of loose silt
and fine debris in the bottom. At that time, the
upper 18–24 inches of the feature (i.e., the top
five or six courses of brick) was destroyed and
pushed into the feature. The original top of the
feature was less than a foot below surface. In
2005, the feature was identified as having been
a grease trap. The upper half of the feature was
removed at this time, but no documentation was
done.
When the feature was rediscovered in 2008,
plumbers immediately suspected it was an old
grease trap. The intact portion was found at 3 ft
below surface, and it extended another 3 ft
deeper. Hand excavations exposed the lower half
of the cylinder, which was 24 inches interior di­
ameter and about 32 inches exterior. The wall
was about 4 inches thick and was constructed
of a single layer of stretcher-laid bricks, but most
of the brick had been broken to shorten their
lengths because of the tight curvature of the cir­
cular wall. The portion of the cylinder that re­

Small Manhole, Feature 4
Feature 4 is a small concrete sewer box lo­
cated in the northeast lawn (see Table 2.2 and
Figure 2.1). The box has a concrete lid that al­
lows access to the sewer pipe exiting the man­
sion. The lid was poured in a form and is solid
hard concrete. It measures 2¼ to 2½ inches thick
and has a 1¾-inch lip. The top of the lid is flat,
but the outer 3 inches of each side is slightly
beveled.
The feature was buried under 6 to 9 inches
of soil when it was first found. The exterior of
the box measures about 29x27 inches and about
27 inches deep. When the lid was removed, it
revealed that the interior of the box was empty
and had concrete walls 3¼ to 3½ inches thick.
The box’s interior measures 25½ inches eastwest by 24 inches north-south, and it is 2 ft deep.
The upper 6 inches of concrete is coarse and con­
tains many gravels while the rest of the wall is
constructed of finer concrete with fewer grav­
els. A ca. 5-inch-diameter pipe empties into the
upper part of the interior along the west wall
near the southwest corner of the box. At the
bottom of the box, a 5-inch opening in the north
wall near the northeast corner serves as the exit
drain. Subsequent work showed that this drain
went into the sewer line manhole (Feature 1)
north of Feature 4. In the bottom of the Feature
4 box was a gravelly fill estimated to be 6–12
inches deep, but no attempt was made to remove
any of it.
Because Feature 4 was located on the pe­
riphery of the Area 1 excavations, it did not have
to be impacted by the project. It was left in place

Chapter 5: Feature Descriptions
mained intact in 2008 was about 30 to 34 inches
deep on the inside. Its interior was neatly plas­
tered with hard concrete, and it had a flat bot­
tom. The loose silt and debris remaining in the
bottom was collected as a sample. Small fish
bones and tiny glass shards were observed in
this silty mixture.
Because of its location within Area 1, the
plumbers needed to remove the eastern portion
of the grease trap soon after it was found (Fig­
ure 5.12). After PAI archeologists had docu­
mented the feature, THC representatives gave
permission to destroy it. Most or all of the fea­
ture was eventually removed to make way for
the new grease trap.
It is not known when Feature 8 was built.
The hand-molded bricks would suggest that this

feature could have been built in the late nine­
teenth century or even as late as during the 1914
renovations, when they were still using old
bricks. However, the use of hard concrete as
mortar is consistent with construction during
the 1914 renovations or sometime later. In 1914,
the new west wing was intentionally constructed
of old handmade bricks to match the rest of the
mansion, but the basement walls were built with
modern machine-made bricks and concrete mortar. The old bricks that were reused in 1914 were
presumably ones saved from the demolition of
the original west wing and perhaps other old
buildings as well. The use of handmade bricks
and concrete mortar suggests that the feature
most likely dates to the early part of the twenti­
eth century, and it is quite possible that the
grease trap was built in 1914
using broken bricks salvaged
from the construction site or
some other location.
UNIDENTIFIED
FEATURES
Two concrete slabs and one
pit feature were found. The
functions of these features can­
not be determined based on the
limited exposures.

Two large slabs of concrete
were exposed in Area 1 (see
Table 2.2 and Figure 2.1). Both
were made of rough-poured
concrete and were only par­
tially exposed. Feature 5 was
encountered 18 inches below
surface. Its southern edge ran
northwest to southeast for at
least 12 ft. The thickness of the
slab is not known, and the en­
tire slab was never exposed all
at once. Portions of the slab
were seen at different times as
it was uncovered and reburied
multiple times while plumbing
work was done in Area 1 over
several months.

Archeological Investigations at the Governor’s Mansion
Feature 6 is a 2½-inch-thick concrete slab
that was about 24 inches below surface. It runs
north-south. Feature 6 overlaps onto the Fea­
ture 5 slab. As was the case with Feature 5, the
Feature 6 slab was only viewed in sections as
portions of Area 1 were excavated and reburied
several times during the course of the plumb­
ing work.
Features 5 and 6 were constructed of mod­
ern concrete, and they were likely built in the
mid- to late twentieth century. The purpose of
the concrete slabs in Area 1 is not clear, but it is
likely that they were installed as the protective
covers for buried utilities running between the
mansion and the carriage house. These features
were not impacted by the current project, and
they were reburied after the new grease trap
and utility lines were installed in Area 1.

Area 4 (see Table 2.2 and Figure 2.2). The pitlike feature was 2 ft wide at the top and tapered
down to about half that size at the bottom. It
was from 11 ft 2 inches to 13 ft 2 inches north of
the southern end of the water line trench (see
Figure 2.4). The water line trench was 22 inches
deep here, but the pit clearly terminated just
above the bottom of the trench. The natural A
horizon was composed of brown clay loam with
few gravels and many roots, and this fill dipped
into the pit feature, which was intrusive into
the hard gravelly clay that was mottled white,
brown to grayish brown, and reddish brown. The
feature was observed in both the east and west
walls of the pipeline.
It is not clear exactly what Feature 7 repre­
sents. This pit could be the location of a tree or
large shrub that was removed or rotted in place.
Alternatively, the pit could represent an old util­
ity line trench or other intrusive linear feature.
No attempt was made to further examine this
feature by excavating beyond the water line
trench.

INTERPRETATIONS AND
RECOMMENDATIONS

6

The Texas Governor’s Mansion and the sur­
rounding grounds have gone through many
changes since 1856. As each new governor took
office, a new family would move into the man­
sion, redecorate the interior, and make cosmetic
changes to the exterior.
But the most significant changes occurred
when the state saw the need to undertake ma­
jor renovations to better maintain or upgrade
the mansion, to add new buildings or facilities
around it, or to beautify the exterior. The latter
often entailed completely removing old improve­
ments and replacing them with new landscap­
ing, gardens, walkways, and outbuildings. The
need for increased security was the impetus for
many alterations to the mansion and grounds
over the past 50 years, with the perimeter wall
fence and locking gates being the most obvious
manifestations.
Many improvements to the grounds have
been made and replaced since the mansion was
built. Vegetable and flower gardens were
planted and removed. Privy pits were built and
filled in upon final abandonment. The large sub­
terranean water cisterns were covered over
when the city water system made them obso­
lete. A gazebo was built, removed, and ultimately
replaced with a historical replica to bring back
the look and feel of bygone days. Numerous net­
works of walkways and extensive landscaping
features were built, renovated, removed, or bur­
ied by subsequent landscaping. These are just
of few of the many activities that have altered
the mansion and the grounds over the past 150
years. Archeologically, some evidence of these
and other historical activities has survived as a
testament to the grand history of the Governor’s
Mansion.

BRICKS AND MORTAR
Bricks and mortar constitute an
important line of evidence for archeological
interpretation. These key structural elements
may reveal much about buildings and features,
such as when they were reconstructed, how they
function, when there were damaged or repaired,
and even who made them. By their very nature,
bricks embody a great deal of information about
changes in brick making technology and
construction economics. Many bricks have
specific attributes, such as impressions or
stamped marks, that are particularly important
for identifying when and where they were made.
There are some important general observa­
tions that may be inferred from the bricks and
mortar associated with various features at the
Governor’s Mansion (Table 6.1). The earliest fea­
tures at the mansion—specifically the stairway
wall (Feature 3) and the two cisterns (Features
9 and 14)—were constructed of handmade Aus­
tin Common bricks bonded with soft granular
mortar. The grease trap (Feature 8) was con­
structed of handmade (Type 2) bricks bonded
with hard concrete mortar. All of the brick piers
(Feature 15) under the 1914 addition and a
modification to the stairway wall (see Feature
3) were constructed of machine-made bricks
bonded by hard concrete mortar.
Type 1 Austin Common bricks with a rect­
angular frog are the earliest bricks used at the
Governor’s Mansion. Type 1 bricks were ob­
served in place at the base of the mansion
though a ground-level opening in the exterior
north wall of the original mansion, and it is pre­
sumed that all of the bricks used in the 1856
construction are probably Type 1. The original

privy at the mansion, also built about 1856 and
used for only a few months that year, was made
of Type 1 bricks and soft sandy mortar (Blake
and Kibler 1999:14, 16). In his extensive inven­
tory of Texas bricks, Steinbomer (1982) illus­
trates a Type 1 brick from the Paggi House in
Austin, which was constructed of hand-molded
Austin Common frog bricks. Additional evidence
for Type 1 bricks being early was found at the
site of the Austin Convention Center. Anthony
(2008a:n.p.) reports that only one of the eight
cisterns found there was constructed of yellow
bricks with a frog. Notably, this cistern was as­
sociated with the Hutchins House, which was
one of the earliest homes in the area. The house
may have been built in 1859 by Abner Cook, the
Governor’s Mansion’s architect and builder, who
owned the property before selling it to Hutchins.
Several sources note that Cook built his own
brick kiln in Austin in the 1850s and that he
supplied the bricks used to build the Governor’s
Mansion between 1854 and 1856 (Daniel et al.
1984:29, 36; Steinbomer 1982:36). Since the
Type 1 frogged Austin Common bricks were used
in the construction of the original mansion and
privy, it may be assumed that they were made
by Abner Cook. Further evidence of this is a
brick from the ca. 1850–1855 Paggi House in
Austin that is identical in size, shape, and color
to the Type 1 bricks found at the Governor’s
Mansion (see Brick No. 25 in Steinbomer
1982:28).
This does not imply that all Type 1 Austin
Common bricks in the Austin area were made
by Abner Cook, nor does it imply that Abner
Cook’s brickyard never produced Type 2 Austin
Common bricks (without the frog). There is little
doubt that the yellow Austin Common bricks—
both with and without frogs—were made locally,
but they could have been made at one of several
different brick plants located in or near Austin.
There were at least 15 brick plants that oper­
ated in Travis County in the late nineteenth and
early twentieth centuries (Steinbomer
1980:n.p.). Steinbomer (1982:36) notes that the
Abner Cook may have made bricks at the site of
the Paggi House in Austin, which he built
around 1850. He notes that the Paggi House
bricks were the same “clay color, consistency, and
composition” as the “Butler/Zilker” bricks made
along the Colorado River. From 1873 to 1913,
the Butler Brick Company made bricks along
the Colorado River in the area where Zilker Park

is now located, and Andrew Jackson Zilker and
Michael Paggi were involved in early
brickmaking (Steinbomer 1980:n.p.; 1982:36).
The name Austin Common is usually used
by historical archeologists in a generic fashion
to refer to a broad range of “buff” or “yellow”
hand-molded bricks that were common in Aus­
tin in the latter half of the nineteenth century
(Blake and Kibler 1999:16; Feit et al. 2003:84;
Steinbomer 1982:28). Historically, these were
called “Austin cream colored brick” (Hafertepe
1992:166). In addition to the handmade variet­
ies, the Austin Common name has been used
for some machine-made bricks. Steinbomer
(1982:No. 27) illustrates a “Typical Austin Com­
mon” brick that is “buff color” and has no frog
but is a “stiff mud” brick. The brick was found
at the site of the “Zilker/Butler Plant” in Aus­
tin, and it was probably manufactured by the
Butler Brick Company between the 1880s and
1930. What this really shows is that the same
clay sources used by Austin manufacturers to
make hand-molded bricks in the mid-nineteenth
century continued to be used into the late-nine­
teenth and early-twentieth centuries after the
adoption of early stiff mud brick making ma­
chines.
Austin Common bricks, with and without
frogs, have been found in other nineteenth-cen­
tury archeological contexts in Austin besides the
Governor’s Mansion. Bricks with one frogged
face were used in the foundation or skirting of
the William Bozeth house (and presumably in a
brick-walled cistern) that was built prior to 1872
some 8 to 10 blocks south of the Governor’s
Mansion (Feit et al. 2003:84). Many features
encountered during excavations at the site of
the convention center in downtown Austin
(about 8 blocks south and 5 blocks east of the
Governor’s Mansion) were built of “yellow” or
“yellow sandy-paste” bricks. Although not called
Austin Common bricks, Brown et al. (2003) re­
port that most of the features were made of plain
bricks (without frogs) but some features were
made of bricks with frogs. One cistern associ­
ated with the Hutchins House was probably
built before 1873, and it was “constructed of a
single thickness of yellow bricks, each with a
recessed panel in one face.” Another cistern as­
sociated with the Dowell House was similar in
construction but was made of “plain yellow
bricks with no distinguishing markings.” The
bricks used to build the basement steps at the
84

Chapter 6: Interpretations and Recommendations
Dowell House were “of the plain yellow variety.”
The Dowell House was built in the 1860s, and
the basement and cistern may have been built
at about the same time or perhaps sometime
later (Brown et al. 2003:121–122, 124–126, 128).
From these few examples, it is clear that Austin
Common bricks were an important construction
material in the early days of Austin, and know­
ing more about who, when, how, and where these
bricks were made would be very helpful for all
Austin historians and archeologists.
Austin Common bricks associated with pre–
Civil War structures also are worthy of detailed
research from another perspective: their asso­
ciation with African American history. It is not
often publicized or even stated with regard to
the Texas Governor’s Mansion, but the bricks
used in the walls of the mansion were probably
made by slaves, and the mansion walls them­
selves may have been erected using slave labor.
In his treatise on brickmaking in Texas,
Steinbomer (1982:35) notes that:

ings in Austin. It is possible that he used slave
labor to produce bricks and help build the
Governor’s Mansion (Blake and Kibler 1999:16).
1856 FEATURES
A preponderance of the evidence suggests
that three features—the remnant of the base­
ment stairway wall (Feature 3), a short section
of the kitchen ell porch footing (Feature 10), and
the large cistern (Feature 14)—were built about
1856 as part of the original mansion construc­
tion. All three features are constructed of Type
1 Austin Common bricks and soft limey sand
mortar. All three features were modified and
covered over when the 1914 addition was built
during Governor Colquitt’s administration.
An examination of historic records and a
comparison of historic and modern drawings of
the mansion floor plans were essential to iden­
tifying the functions and dates of construction
for the features found in the basement expan­
sion area. As shown earlier in Figure 2.6, the
three different floor plans for the ground floor
of the Governor’s Mansion show different ver­
sions of what the west wing of the original man­
sion was like, as well as what significant changes
were made to the west wing during the 1914
renovations. It is noteworthy that no copies of
original floor plans of the mansion are known
to exist, so both of the 1856 mansion plans shown
in Figure 2.6 are reconstructed from historical
evidence (the originals of these drawings are in
the “Texas Governor’s Mansion” collection at the
Texas State Library and Archives [2008]). Be­
cause the location of a cistern is shown on both
reconstructed original mansion plans, it is as­
sumed that the architects Hendricks and Har­
ris both had evidence that the cistern existed at
or soon after the original mansion construction
in 1854–1856. These maps both show the loca­
tion of the above-ground portion of the cistern,
and the locations depicted on the two maps is
fairly close. One major difference is that the
Harris plan (see Figure 2.6b) shows a square
enclosing a circle for the cistern, while the
Hendricks plan (see Figure 2.6a) shows a large
octagon enclosing a smaller octagon and square.
A note on the Harris plan states: “(This west
wing original in recollection, photo, and by in­
ference was replaced 1914).” Harris may well
have been depicting what he believed the most
original configuration to be. In contrast, the oc­

Early brickmakers throughout the
South were very often black people held
in slavery to plantation owners. Due to
the attitude of the period, their full
names were not recorded either in
census records or by plantation owners,
making it difficult to bestow upon these
craftsmen the proper credit for their
efforts. Most of the pre-civil war “Greek
Revival” style architecture was built
with slave labor….and brick was the
predominant material for these
imposing structures. The style (and the
habit of keeping slaves) reached Texas
late, along with southern settlers…The
great preponderance of slave-holding
and slave brickmaking occurred in
Texas between 1830 and the Civil War.
Many slaves relocated to Texas from
plantations in major brickmaking
states and many were well-acquainted
with the brickmaking technology so
associated with slavery since biblical
times.
Steinbomer (1982:36) goes on to say that
“The noted contractor Abner Cook in Austin, was
listed as a slave owner during the period he built
the Texas Governor’s Mansion, ‘West Hill,’ the
Pease Mansion and other significant brick build­
85

Archeological Investigations at the Governor’s Mansion
tagon depicted in the Hendricks plan most likely
reflects the octagonal “cistern house” that, along
with the larger octagonal summer (garden)
house, was built in the 1870s (Daniel et al.
1984:130–131, 144–145; McQueary 2003:70).
However, neither location corresponds pre­
cisely with the actual location of the large cis­
tern that was found (Figure 6.1). Given the
layout of the original mansion, the most likely
place for the original cistern to have been built
was indeed on the back side of the mansion
where the West Cistern was found. This cistern
was located tucked into the inside corner of the
original kitchen ell (see Figures 1.1 and 2.6b).
The West Cistern would have received rainfall
not only from the roof of the mansion itself, but
also from the roof and porch of the ell. The cis­
tern location was also most practical in that the
water supply was closest to the kitchen, pantry,
and servant’s quarters. Cisterns found else­
where in Austin tended to be on the back side of
houses and in close proximity to back doors and
kitchens (Anthony 2008a:n.p.; Feit et al.
2003:170).

room was described by some occupants as the
‘only’ bathroom in the house until the original
ell was replaced in 1914.” Is it a coincidence that
the North Cistern is only about 15 ft north of
where this original water closet was located? The
water closet was undoubtedly some primitive
type of flushing toilet, and the smaller cistern
may well have been built to supply water spe­
cifically to keep the toilet’s water system sepa­
rate from the drinking water system. Also, since
the water had to go up to the second floor, it
would make sense for the water supply to be as
close as possible and that some type of pump­
ing system would be attached to the water sup­
ply. All of this evidence suggesting an 1870s
construction date is admittedly circumstantial
but compelling nonetheless. The overall shape,
construction, and interior plaster of the North
Cistern (see Figure 5.7) are quite similar to that
of the large 25,000-gallon cistern found about
two blocks away at the site of Texas’ Temporary
Capitol (1883–1888). Described and illustrated
by Moore et al. (1972:17, 72–73, Figures 21, 40–
43), the cistern had a double-brick wall made of
handmade bricks, and cement mortar was used
to bond the bricks and as interior plaster. Fea­
ture photographs show the wall and bricks in
an opening on the side, and the wall was about
8–10 inches thick. No frogs are visible on the
bricks, nor are they mentioned in any of the de­
scriptions of the cistern or other brick features.
This suggests that the brick features at the Tem­
porary Capitol were built with plain Austin
Common bricks (see Type 2). The Temporary
Capitol cistern was built in 1882 or 1883, and
its size and construction are specifically men­
tioned in the 1882 “Contracts for Building the
Temporary State Capitol” (Moore et al. 1972:Ap­
pendix I).
The age of the plumbing features found in­
side the North Cistern also is unclear. It con­
sists of a water pipe and cutoff valve attached
to a cast-iron tube, and this mechanism presum­
ably was part of a water intake and possible fil­
tration system. This plumbing may have been
installed as soon as the cistern was built, or it
may be a modification that was added sometime
later. More research is needed to address this
issue. Parts of an iron water pump mechanism
were found inside the Temporary Capitol cis­
tern, and they were probably mounted to a
wooden frame above the cistern to extract wa­
ter (Moore et al. 1972:Figure 53). It is likely that

NORTH CISTERN
The North Cistern remains somewhat of an
anomaly. It was constructed of hand-molded
Austin Common bricks, which could be either
Type 1 or Type 2, and soft limey sand mortar. It
almost certainly was built prior to the 1880s,
when the Austin’s first city water system was
created (Feit et al. 2003:171). A more substan­
tive clue appears in an 1888 report by the su­
perintendent of public buildings and grounds.
In his report on the condition of the Governor’s
Mansion and the grounds, the superintendent
noted: “…though it has been well cared for and
recently repaired and painted inside and out,
the fencing and cisterns overhauled, and other
incidental work done...” (Daniel et al. 1984:114).
This is the first time that more than one cistern
is mentioned in an official document pertaining
to the mansion.
Precisely when and why the North Cistern
was first constructed are matters of conjecture.
One logical guess is that it was built about 1870,
when the mansion got its first modern toilets
installed. Based on the historical evidence,
Daniel et al. (1984:92) inferred that: “In all prob­
ability, the ‘water closet’ was installed in the
large bathroom in the upstairs ell. That bath­

Chapter 6: Interpretations and Recommendations

Archeological Investigations at the Governor’s Mansion
the North Cistern at the Governor’s Mansion
had a similar pump mechanism at one time.
Although the North Cistern may have been
constructed in the 1870s and certainly before
1888, it is possible that it was not built to sup­
ply water for toilets. This cistern could have been
built primarily to supply water for the mansion’s
lawn, gardens, and fountains or to increase the
mansion’s water supply in case of fire. A great
deal of attention was paid to the aesthetics of
the grounds at this time, especially in the early
1870s (see Table 1.2 listings for 1871–1890).
Notably, Austin’s municipal fire department was
created in 1871 (Gammel 1898, Vol. 7:291), and
having a dependable water supply for fire sup­
pression was a major concern.
There is archeological and historical evi­
dence suggesting that, despite the availability
of city water in Austin beginning in the 1880s,
cisterns continued to be used well into the twen­
tieth century (Anthony 2008a:n.p.; Feit et al.
2003:170–171). No current evidence, historical
or archeological, provides any definitive proof
of how long the North Cistern was used at the
Governor’s Mansion. It could have been aban­
doned and buried in the 1880s or 1890s, or it
might have been used into the twentieth cen­
tury, if only to water gardens and refill the foun­
tains.

examined the body of archival information avail­
able in some published sources and became fa­
miliar with the general history of improvements
to the mansion, the mansion grounds, and utili­
ties infrastructure on the property. During this
process, we learned that this cursory study was
rather inadequate in many ways. The recom­
mendations presented herein are aimed at in­
creasing the overall historical knowledge of the
Governor’s Mansion and improving the quality
and accessibility of historical information to help
future historians and archeologists involved
with maintenance or development projects on
the mansion property.
Need for Continued
Archeological Monitoring
This project clearly demonstrates the need
for having a knowledgeable historical archeolo­
gist conduct onsite monitoring whenever devel­
opment plans call for excavation of sediments
on the mansion block. This includes monitoring
all subsurface excavations that occur on the
mansion grounds as well as subfloor excavations
below the mansion or any other structures on
the property. There are probably many surprises
that remain buried at the mansion, and a great
deal can be learned about the architecture and
history of the mansion through studies of fea­
tures found during archeological monitoring.
When the archeological monitoring work
began, and several times during the investiga­
tions, PAI archeologists inquired about historic
plan maps showing the underground improve­
ments, especially the myriad of buried utilities,
that were added to the mansion over the years.
While we really did not expect such maps to exist
for the nineteenth century, we thought that they
would exist for the twentieth century and would
have been compiled during planning for the De­
ferred Maintenance Project. We found out that
such maps either do not exist, or, perhaps more
likely, have not been found, recognized for what
they are, and distributed to the right people. We
discovered that even the plumbers working on
the Deferred Maintenance Project were work­
ing in the dark, without benefit of any maps or
records showing where buried utilities were lo­
cated. Even the precise locations of recent utili­
ties, such as the 24-inch PVC Dectron line (for
air ventilation) installed on the north side of the
mansion in 2005, were not known.

GREASE TRAP
The grease trap (Feature 8) was found 3 ft
north of the north wall of the 1914 addition. It
was in close proximity to the mansion’s original
kitchen ell and also to the west wing kitchen
that was part of the 1914 addition. Thus, the
age of this feature cannot be deduced from its
location alone. The feature was constructed of
Type 2 bricks, but the use of hard concrete mor­
tar suggests that the grease trap was associated
with the 1914 kitchen and not associated with
the original kitchen. The grease trap may have
been built in 1914, but additional research
would be needed to confirm that date.
RECOMMENDATIONS
This final section presents some recommen­
dations regarding the archeology and history of
the Governor’s Mansion. In the process of con­
ducting archeological monitoring for the De­
ferred Maintenance Project, PAI archeologists

Chapter 6: Interpretations and Recommendations
Documenting the improvements made at
the mansion has been a requirement for many
years. In fact, a state law approved on February
7, 1884, mandated that the superintendent in
charge of state buildings (presumably the “Su­
perintendent of Public Buildings and Grounds”
mentioned in other records) create maps of bur­
ied utilities. The law stated that the superin­
tendent “shall also be required to prepare and
have in his office a copy of the plans of all public
buildings and improvements thereto under his
charge, showing the exact location of all water,
gas, and sewerage pipes, so that in case of needed
repairs or inspections, their position can be de­
termined without unnecessary expense”
(Gammel 1898:Vol. 9:594). This suggests that
some very useful plan maps once existed, and
they would constitute a tremendous historical
record of the mansion if they could be located.
Copious detailed records pertaining to the
mansion were undoubtedly compiled over the
years, and many of those records probably re­
main scattered in obscure places and held by
different agencies. In retrospect, it seems rather
odd that despite the fact that the Governor’s
Mansion is one of the state’s premier historical
sites, no serious attempt has been made to find
and organize the records and make sense out of
the history of infrastructure improvements.

cal questions, lies buried within the boxes of
mansion records that have been compiled (e.g.,
Texas State Library and Archives Commission
2008) or elsewhere in untapped archive files.
Unfortunately, the plans to do some of this ad­
ditional research were terminated as a result of
the devastating mansion fire in June 2008.
Now that the renovations of the mansion are
back on track, it is recommended that a com­
prehensive archival study of primary mansion
records is needed more than ever. Archival re­
search is needed to better define when and
where various improvements were made over
the years, not only to the mansion itself but to
the entire mansion grounds. A comprehensive
archival research effort should attempt the fol­
lowing tasks:

Need for Additional
Archival Research

During this project, PAI attempted to gather
as much historical evidence as possible about
the improvements and renovations that have
been done on the mansion property. We reviewed
published historical reports and examined many
historic photographs and maps. There was, we
discovered, uncertainty about when certain his­
toric photographs were taken, as well as some
contradictory information regarding the timing
of some key events. In May 2008, plans were
being made to conduct more extensive research
on mansion improvements using the original
mansion records housed at the Texas State Li­
brary and Archives Commission (2008). This
proposed effort was driven in large part by the
lack of information on the construction dates for
the two cisterns and other features found on the
mansion grounds. It is likely that evidence per­
taining to the age of these features, as well as
data pertinent to a broad range of other histori­

grounds.

Despite the vast amount of information po­
tential inherent in these materials, bricks and
mortar are often overlooked or ignored in his­
toric archeological studies. More often than not,
bricks and mortar are not discussed or only
briefly mentioned in technical reports detailing
historic archeological investigations, and they
seldom are properly described or analyzed to
maximize their potential data yield. Because
many of the bricks and mortar samples from the
Governor’s Mansion are linked to specific fea­
tures that have known or probable construction
dates (see Tables 4.2 and 4.3), they can provide
chronological evidence useful for archeological
interpretations at other sites in Austin. A more
detailed study of the Governor’s Mansion hand­
made bricks and mortar samples would provide
important information for historical archeolo­
gists in future investigations.
If a sufficient sample of Austin Common
bricks, both frogged and plain, from known lo­
cations could be analyzed using grain-size analy­
sis and geochemical methods, it might be
possible to better define variability in handmade
bricks. A long-term project should include sam­
pling of bricks and mortar from all known Abner
Cook buildings in Austin, as well as locating and
sampling bricks from other well-dated nine­
teenth-century contexts. Identifying and sam­
pling clay sources and waste bricks from
nineteenth-century brickyards on the Colorado
River near Austin would be beneficial.

Bricks and Mortar:
Archeological Analyses
of the Building Blocks of Early
Austin
Much of early Austin was constructed of
bricks, limestone, and mortar, and these building
components are found in almost all locations
where archeological investigations have occurred
in the greater downtown area. Bricks and mortar
are especially important classes of archeological
evidence because they contain so much informa­
tion. Since they were manufactured for specific
purposes, were widely used, and the manufactur­
ing technologies changed through time, bricks are
important chronological indicators.They can help
archeologists date the original construction of all
types of buildings and features and determine
when additions, modifications, or repairs were
made. One pattern noted at the Governor’s Man­
sion is that the Austin Common frogged bricks
(Type 1) are associated with earlier features than
the Austin Common plain bricks (Type 2). An­
thony (2008a:n.p.) observed the same pattern in
the archeological remains at the Austin Conven­
tion Center.

“A Privy Affair”: Toward a
Broader Understanding
of Nineteenth-Century Waste
Management
“A Privy Affair” is an incident that occurred
at the Governor’s Mansion in 1856. Daniel et al.
(1984:53–54) describes the odd series of events.
The story involves the mansion’s first privy, built
on the northeast side of the mansion, and sub­
sequent complaints from the neighbor across the
street of having a front-door view of the un­
sightly outhouse. This led to the abandonment
of the first privy and construction of a second
privy somewhere on the south side of the man­
sion. The first privy at the mansion was discov­
ered and partially documented in a previous
archeological study (Blake and Kibler 1999). We
now think we know the location of the second
privy based on historical evidence and the
90

Chapter 6: Interpretations and Recommendations
Additional work is recommended to remedy
these deficiencies. It is recommended that ar­
cheological test excavations be conducted on the
possible privy location identified by the groundpenetrating radar survey (see Chapter 3). If the
privy is found, the test excavations should be
extensive enough to identify the size, shape, and
construction of the privy, as well as the depth
and the nature of the deposits inside. This ar­
cheological data is critical for comparison with
the data on the first privy and other archeologi­
cal examples of mid- to late-nineteenth-century
privies in Texas. Also, it would be helpful to con­
duct ground-penetrating radar surveys over all
areas of the back half of the mansion to search
for buried features and possible privy pits. While
many areas are covered with concrete or other
paved surfaces, it may be possible to get sub­
surface results from surveys in these areas.
The privies at the Texas Governor’s Man­
sion can be better understood if an archeologi­
cal literature review and comparative study of
nineteenth-century privies is undertaken. It is
recommended that a comparative study be un­
dertaken focusing on published data on nine­
teenth-century privies in Austin but also looking
at privy use in other cities.
Urban archeology in other Texas ci0ties
provides useful comparative data on privies. Ex­
tensive work has been done on nineteenth-cen­
tury privies in Houston, although only limited
data are sometimes reported (e.g., Carlson
2002a:17.8–17.12). A study of pollen extracted
from privy deposits is particularly notable for
its identification of plants and plant foods in
nineteenth-century Houston (Marshall 2002). A
much more complete study exists for privies
found at the site of the Alamodome in San An­
tonio. Brown and DeLaO (1997) present the re­
sults of a rather in-depth study titled: “Beneath
a Crescent Moon: A Contextual and Architec­
tural Analysis of Privies from the Alamodome
Project Area.” They describe 12 privy pits that
are unlined (n = 1), or lined with bricks (n = 7),
cut limestone rocks (n = 1), cedar posts (n = 1),
stacked wooden crates (n = 1), or other wood
(n = 1).Their contextual analysis considers these
outhouse remnants in light of San Antonio city
ordinances regarding health and safety, privy
placement within lots and relative to houses and
other features, and the nature of the variations
in privy size and materials used for lining them.
Several archeological studies provide infor­

ground-penetrating radar survey conducted in
2008 (see Chapter 3).
Exactly how many privies were at the
Governor’s Mansion over the years is a mat­
ter of conjecture, but it is a fair guess to say
that there were many. Even as the mansion
was being built from 1854 to 1856, temporary
privies may have been constructed and used
by the construction workers. Privies would
have been used from 1856 at least until the
mansion got its first toilets (water closets) in
the 1870s and a sewer system in the 1880s.
Furthermore, there were probably separate
privies for the servants and staff who worked
at the Governor’s Mansion, and they probably
continued to use outdoor privies for some time
after toilets and sewage plumbing were first
installed. Because the city’s first sewer sys­
tems were rather unreliable, there was an
incentive to keep privies operational as a
backup long after indoor plumbing was in­
stalled. Privies were still used in many parts
of Austin well into the twentieth century (An­
thony 2008b:n.p.). Blake and Kibler
(1999:Figure 3, 17) suggest that a probable
privy house on the south lawn appears in a
photograph from the 1890s—many years af­
ter the mansion reportedly got indoor toilets.
Daniel et al. (1984:108, 144) note “outhouses
repaired and painted” in 1883 and that “most
outhouses in the rear were torn down” dur­
ing the 1914 renovations. These statements
imply that there were several outhouses on
the mansion grounds at any given time, and
that at least one outhouse was kept in use
after 1914.
Based on this evidence, some admittedly cir­
cumstantial, it must be assumed that there were
once many privy locations on the Governor’s
Mansion property, and that there is a good like­
lihood that archeological remains of these priv­
ies may exist. While we know some details about
the construction of the mansion’s first privy, a
rather substantial brick-walled structure used
only for a brief period in 1856 (see Blake and
Kibler 1999:16), we know nothing about the sec­
ond privy or the other privies that probably ex­
isted on the mansion grounds. It is doubtful that
all of the privies on the property are as large or
elaborate as the first brick privy. Consequently,
it seems that there are still many unknown de­
tails about the privy affairs at the Texas
Governor’s Mansion.
91

Archeological Investigations at the Governor’s Mansion
mation on nineteenth- and early-twentieth-cen­
tury privies in Austin (e.g., Brown et al. 2003,
2006, 2008; Feit et al. 2003). Numerous privies
were investigated in an archeological project at
the notorious Guy Town district in Austin (con­
centrated between 1st and 5th Streets and
Guadalupe and Colorado). Feit et al. (2003:170)
provide descriptions of the Guy Town privies and
a thoughtful discussion of patterns observed in
the placement of privies within city lots. The
most comprehensive work on privies in Austin
was done in conjunction with the extensive data
recovery excavations at the site of the Austin
Convention Center (Brown and Anthony 2008),
and Brown et al. (2008) present an entire chap­
ter titled: “Out of the Closet: Privies at the Con­
vention Center.” This is a historical overview of
the privies in Austin, and it is notable that they
cite evidence that privies were still commonly
used in the city as late as 1912.
All of the studies mentioned above synthe­
size project-specific data, but it appears that no
comprehensive study has looked at nineteenthcentury urban privies across an entire Texas city
or between cities. A broader perspective on privy
use can be gained by comparing archeological
data on privies from multiple areas within a city
and comparing privy data between cities. Simi­
larly, a comparison of various laws and ordi­
nances enacted by different cities would provide
much-needed insight into changing social per­
spectives on privies, health issues, and urban
waste management.
In 2000, the Society for Historical Archae­
ology devoted an entire volume of Historical
Archaeology to the archeology of privies
(Wheeler 2000a). Titled “View from the Out­
house: What We Can Learn From the Excava­
tion of Privies,” the volume contains eight
articles that identify many important research
issues that can be addressed through compara­
tive studies of the archeological remains of priv­
ies. The list of topics that may be studied via
privy archeology is impressive. It includes re­
search issues like: historical perceptions of
health and sanitation practices in urban vs. ru­
ral settings; diet, foodways, and pathology as
expressed in fecal remains; technological
changes as expressed in construction methods;
differential socioeconomic status; ethnicity dif­
ferences; and privy abandonment and history
of municipal wastewater systems.

Investigating Cisterns:
Understanding
Austin’s Early Water Systems
In the event that any improvements are
made to the area of the covered porch on the
west side of the mansion, it is recommended that
archeological test excavations be conducted be­
neath the floor of the porch to further investi­
gate the West Cistern. Historical and
archeological evidence indicate that this was the
original cistern at the mansion, built during the
1854–1856 construction phase. An archeologi­
cal investigation should expose the top of the
cistern to: allow examination of the construc­
tion details of the neck; search for inflow and
overflow lines; get a more accurate measure­
ment of the cistern’s diameter; and determine if
the structure is made of Type 1 or Type 2 Aus­
tin Common bricks. The study should also in­
clude boring a core hole in the center of the
cistern, all the way to the bottom to examine
the fill inside (acknowledging that this will be
difficult if the cistern was filled with any large
debris such as bricks or concrete). This would
allow for an accurate measurement of the
cistern’s depth and water volume estimates, and
examination of the fill would provide informa­
tion on the cistern’s abandonment history.
The unusual plumbing features found inside
the North Cistern (see Figures 5.8 and 5.9) war­
rant attention. The water pipe and elongated
vertical box were part of some type of pumping
mechanism, and the tubular box served as a
water intake and probably housed some type of
water filtration system, most likely using a char­
coal filter insert. The authors have never seen
such an elaborate pumping and possible filtra­
tion system built into a cistern before, and it is
likely that the mechanism represents a patented
device that was state of the art at the time it
was installed. It is recommended that a histori­
cal archeologist or historian conduct a search
for archival records and historical publications
to find information about cistern water filtra­
tion systems. This search should include look­
ing for online patents for cistern filtration
systems. Many hundreds of patents were issued
in the late nineteenth and early twentieth cen­
turies for cistern filtration systems that would
cleanse the water before it entered the cistern
or while it was pumped out of the cistern.

92

Chapter 6: Interpretations and Recommendations
The brick-walled cisterns at the Texas
Governor’s Mansion could be better understood
through an archeological literature review and
examination of nineteenth- and early twentiethcentury cisterns in Austin and other urban ar­
eas. Consequently, it is recommended that a com­
parative study be undertaken to synthesize and
analyze published historical and archeological
data on nineteenth-century cisterns. This study
should focus first on the downtown Austin area,
where many historic cisterns have been found,
and then expand out for comparisons with cis­
tern found in other cities such as Houston and
San Antonio.
Many archeological projects, both large
and small, have generated useful archeologi­
cal data on cisterns in urban areas. It is the
large-scale archeological projects, however,
that have produced the most important data
on cisterns, such as work in Houston (e.g.,
Carlson 2002a), San Antonio (e.g., Fox et al.
1997), and Austin (e.g., Brown and Anthony
2008). In conjunction with the Alamodome
archeological project, Gross and Mendez
(1997) present a study titled: “An Examina­
tion of Aequias, Wells, and Cisterns in San
Antonio, Texas, ca. 1850–1930.” It provides a
comparative analysis of cistern data as well
as a historical overview with critical baseline
information for understanding cisterns from
a broader historical perspective. Similarly, ex­
tensive historic archeological investigations
at the site of the baseball stadium at Union
Station (formerly called Enron Field and now
Minute Maid Stadium) has yielded important
data on wells and cisterns in downtown Hous­
ton. Mahoney (2002:17.4–17.8) offers descrip­
tions of the wells and cisterns, and Carlson
(2002b) summarizes the water resource fea­
tures from the ballpark project. Unfortu­
nately, only 7 of the 13 cisterns found at the
site were excavated, and brief descriptions are
presented for only 3 of the excavated cisterns
(Mahoney 2002:17.4–17.5).
A considerable amount of archeological work
has been done on nineteenth-century cisterns
in Austin, but most of these studies report only
one or two cisterns from small isolated project
areas (e.g., Godwin 1997; Horizon Environmen­
tal Services 1992). Some of the larger archeo­
logical study areas provide data on numerous
cisterns and synthesize cistern data from their
specific project areas (e.g., Brown et al. 2003,

2006; Feit et al. 2003). The largest archeologi­
cal project in Austin was downtown at the site
of the Austin Convention Center, where 8 cis­
terns and 4 wells were investigated (Brown and
Anthony 2008). Anthony (2008a) presents de­
tailed descriptions of each of the features, along
with a historical overview and thoughtful dis­
cussion of the important role of cisterns prior
to, during, and after the appearance of the city’s
first water systems.
A comparative study of Austin cisterns
also should include a search to identify and
define the history of state laws and Austin
city ordinances pertaining to the history of
cisterns and municipal water systems, fire
safety concerns, and health issues. The study
should synthesize and expand upon the in­
formation provided by Anthony (2008b) in her
study titled “City Services in Late Nine­
teenth-Century Austin.” Of particular note for
the Governor’s Mansion, for example, Texas
officials were especially concerned with fire
safety issues in Austin in 1871. One law ap­
proved on November 25, 1871, authorized the
state to “completion the artesian well and
build two new cisterns in the capitol yard”
(Gammel 1898:Vol.7:40). These new cisterns
would have been at the second capitol, which
was built in 1853 and burned in 1881, and
was located just north of the current capitol
and only a few blocks from the Governor’s
Mansion. Approved only a few days later on
December 1, 1871, a second law (Gammel
1898:Vol.7:291) authorized the city council to
create a municipal fire department for the
City of Austin. An Austin city water system
was created as a result of a state law enacted
in May 1882 (Gammel 1898:Vol. 9:300–301).
It authorized the governor and various state
agencies to contract for the construction of a
water supply system for state facilities, in­
cluding the Governor’s Mansion. The law
specified that the water supply be suitable for
fire protection and capable of producing “not
less than four effective fire streams, one hun­
dred feet high.” At the same time, the law
specified that the water “shall be filtered and
suitable for culinary and other domestic pur­
poses.” These few examples illustrate the fact
that nineteenth-century cisterns in Austin are
only one component within a complex history
of urban water management.
The well and cistern study by Anthony
93

Archeological Investigations at the Governor’s Mansion
(2008a) provides the best background data on
nineteenth- and early twentieth-century water
systems in Austin. She defines the following
three research issues for cisterns:

Within each of these categories, there are
many specific research questions that may be
addressed. A comprehensive study of urban cis­
terns in Texas should focus on using archeologi­
cal and historical data to examine issues such
as: chronological and geographic variations in
cistern design and construction (materials and
methods); tracking changes in cistern technol­
ogy across time and space; health concerns and
the use of water filtration systems; functional
variations of cisterns (household water use vs.
water supply for fire safety); socioeconomic sta­
tus as reflected in cistern size, construction
materials, and relative cost; and ethnicity as
reflected in cistern design and style.

(1) use life, i.e., date of
construction and date of
abandonment as water
storage facility;
(2) the status and activities of the
resident’s occupants; and
(3) development of water supply
