Miniature Distal Endscrapers from the Southern High Plains

By Scott D. Brosowske

NOTES FROM THE EDITOR’S DESK
We had an excellent program last month. Melissa Griswold talked to us about the
Herring Hotel. Some of us (okay, me!) hadn’t known of the Herring’s twin, the President. The President has been restored, but the Herring is awaiting its renewal.
I thought how nice it would be if Ms. Griswold’s work could be known to a wider
audience. Books, TV, movies. The problem is hard to describe, but I’m thinking that
even if it were to be preserved in such a form, who at some future time would know
what it meant — or care?
Some kid on TV the other night, in one of those man-on-the-street things, was asked
about certain prominent people. He recognized Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln did a couple of things, the boy thought, but he was racist. The interviewer was totally flabbergasted. So was I.
Which brings us to archaeology. Historians think in terms of centuries and documents. Archaeologists think of millennia and material remains, mostly lithics. We stand in front of a wall of rock art and try to imagine what it might mean.
Perhaps it tells the story of some long-ago Lincoln, but we stand as confused and uninformed as the young man on TV.
Confused, uninformed. And humbled.

MINUTES OF THE LAST MEETING
PANHANDLE ARCHAEOLOGICAL SOCIETY
February 17, 2016
The meeting was called to order by Vice-president Veronica Arias at 7:00 PM at the Downtown Amarillo Library second
floor Board Room.
There were 16 members and two visitors in attendance.
PROGRAM: Veronica Arias introduced Melissa Griswold, who began her association with the Herring Hotel 3 1/2 years
ago. She presented a program on the past, present and future of the hotel which was built in 1926 to answer the need for
rooms during the oil boom of the 20s. Amarillo led the nation in construction during that time, and the Herring was the
fourth largest hotel in Texas with 600 rooms and 600 baths. C.T. Herring and Ernest Thompson were partners in the project. At about the same time Herring was involved in construction of a “twin” hotel, the President, in Kansas City, which
has recently undergone restoration. Melissa showed slides of the two in their early days and today with the President’s
restoration and the Herrings desolation. Much of Amarillo’s business, court, and social life centered around the Herring
before 1967 when it went into bankruptcy. The Federal government leased it in 1970 and turned it into offices, tearing out
much of the old decor and replacing it with “Fed Era Ugly.” Restoration awaits.
MINUTES: The January minutes were approved as published in the PAS newsletter.
TREASURER’S REPORT: Treasurer Pam Allison reported a balance of $4197.71. The report was approved.
PUBLICATIONS COMMITTEE REPORT: Rolla Shaller of reported a balance of $1285.97 in the money market account
and $5052.01 in the CD. The report was approved
OLD BUSINESS: The TAS Lithic Academy will be the first weekend in April at the PPHM with bus transportation to the
Palo Duro Canyon.
Southwest Federation will be April 8, 9, 10 in Quitaque, hosted by the Caprock Canyonlands Society.
NEW BUSINESS: Six volunteers are needed for the Lamar Elementary Science Day May 20th.
The meeting adjourned at 8:30 PM.
Respectfully submitted,

SWFAS last year, and will speak there again this year.

ABSTRACT
Cupules are generally accepted as the oldest form of rock art, appearing as far
back as the Lower Paleolithic. A relatively small hemispheric form (1.5-10 cm
wide and 10-12 mm deep), they often occur along with straight grooves. Found
on every continent except Antarctica, they are not natural, but man-made by
pounding the rock surface. They are neither metates nor querns. Opinions vary as
to their purpose: worship, magic, geophage, or perhaps something that does not
occur to the modern mind. Their ubiquitous appearance over time and space certainly shows that they represent an effort to satisfy the basic needs of humankind, especially the needs of women.

Miniature Distal Endscrapers from the Southern High Plains
Scott D. Brosowske
Recently, while documenting a private artifact collection from the Oklahoma panhandle we came across a miniscule sized
distal endscraper (Figure 1). Over the years we have seen, both from excavated contexts and private collections, undersized distal endscrapers. Often these small scrapers simply represent tools that were thoroughly exhausted. Many of these
items, however, were so small that we have often wondered if they were actually used to scrape bison hides. Having
skinned many animals while growing up, I have speculated that these small scrapers could have been used to clean around
the eyes and ears of smaller animal hides, such as the prairie dog skin from the Kenton Caves in Cimarron County, Oklahoma that was made into a small bag to store seeds. I have also wondered if these small scrapers simply represented children’s tools used as they imitated work done by their mothers and fathers. We may never know how these small tools
were used.

Figure 1 Texas County, Oklahoma Undersized Distal Endscraper
Considering that this scraper may likely be the smallest we have ever seen we thought it might be worthwhile to report this
unique artifact in hopes of hearing from others who may be aware of other similarly sized distal endscrapers. We are also
interested receiving input from others for alternative uses, other than processing hides, for these small tools. This possible
scraping tool was made of Alibates silicified dolomite and was recovered from Texas County, Oklahoma. Metric attributes are presented in Table 1.
