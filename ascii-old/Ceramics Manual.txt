PART I
Introduction
The purpose of this workbook is to provide a comprehensive background and
understanding of archeological ceramics. The Texas Archeology Academy shows
participants how archeology is done and why we do it. We want you to gain an
appreciation and understanding of archeology to enhance your experiences and awareness
of the world around you, and of our past heritages. The basic source of information for
archeology is the material remains of past cultures. We are going to take just one of many
material classes, ceramics, to show how the study of material remains can reveal much
about a culture and its people.
Ceramics constitutes one of the largest and most informative material classes
recovered from archeological sites. This two-day workshop explores the kinds of
information that ceramics reveal. All terms shown in bold in the workbook are defined in
the Glossary.
A comprehensive study of ceramics incorporates many approaches, as indicated
by the topics to be addressed in this workshop. These topics include:
1.

Definition and origins of pottery;

2.

Technology; how pottery was made;

3.

Decoration; how pottery was embellished;

4.

Sherd analysis; how pottery is analyzed and for what purpose;

5.

Interpretation; what we can learn from pottery in terms of chronology,
dating, technology, subsistence, social identity and patterns.

Ceramics were the first synthetic material humans created. The word “ceramic”
derives from the Greek word keramos, or “burned earth.” To most of us, the term ceramic
usually means something made of clay, but in the high-tech industrial world, it is more
inclusive and also applies to chemical compounds combining metallic elements. In this
workshop, the term ceramics refers to all artifacts produced from clay, but is not

2
synonymous with the term pottery. Technically speaking, pottery is used to define terra
cottas and earthenwares, or the low-fired ceramics. The term ‘ceramics’ will refer to both
low-fired terra-cotta and earthenwares as well as high fired stonewares (including
pearlware and creamware) and porcelain. I will use the terms interchangeably. While
such items as tiles (including space shuttle tiles), commodes, and spark plugs are
ceramics, our focus will be more on pottery produced by Native Americans and made or
imported by colonial and early Anglo settlers.
Pottery is artificial stone created from earth, fire, air, and water. Not surprisingly,
we know that the creation of pottery from these very basic ingredients carried mystical, if
not sacred, powers in ancient times among at least some Native Americans. Prescriptions
and ingredients for making pottery were traditionally handed down from one generation
to another and such information was often regarded as sacred knowledge. In other words,
traditional knowledge for making pottery was passed vertically through generations, and
not horizontally through diffusion, that is, borrowed from neighbors or other people. The
general notion of pottery, however, was shared and did spread across geographic regions.
Broken bits of pottery, or potsherds (in the old world the term “potshards” is more
common), are also nearly indestructible, and, next to lithics, are the most frequently
encountered material class recovered archeologically. Since pottery is usually readily
abundant and reflects traditional knowledge and behavior, it is sensitive to changes in
time and space. For these reasons pottery is of such interest to archeologists. We use
pottery to identify people, date sites, and reconstruct their ways of life.
The basic ingredients of pottery are clay with temper added as a constituent. The
way clay was mixed, and vessels were formed, shaped, and used, were determined by the
culture or group involved. Pottery was made to serve three basic functions in nonindustrial cultures: cooking, serving, and storage. Basic vessel forms include bowls, jars,
and bottles, and often these were patterned after other container forms such as bottle
gourds, baskets, or stone vessels. Form reflects function. Bowls were used for serving,
jars for cooking and storage, and bottles for serving liquids. The size of the orifice was
roughly related to function. Bowls have wide orifices for easy accessibility; wide-mouth
jars were suitable for cooking, while narrow mouth jars and bottles were used for storage

3
and pouring liquids. These notions are similar to the plastic or glass containers we use
today.
Pottery was traditionally the craft of women in preindustrial societies and
traditional knowledge of pottery was passed on through the mother’s lineal kin. For that
reason, pottery is useful in identifying ancient cultures. Most pottery was consumed
locally, but some pottery moved through earlier economic systems both as containers and
as items of exchange.
Once a good source of clay was located and tested (by making pots), the source
was used for generations, and its location often became a trade secret. Archeologists can
identify clay sources, sometimes to the point of locating the site(s) where a particular
ware was made. We now have the ability to identify the general location of production
through a study of the minerals in the clay (petrography) and by chemical traces in the
clay (trace-element analysis).
Pottery was first produced within the household for household consumption (i.e.,
use). Pottery made and used in the household generally lacked decorations and
embellishment. When pottery was used in social events, public ceremonies, and sacred
contexts, various forms of elaboration were displayed.
Origins of Pottery
Knowledge that burned earth could become soft stone was undoubtedly realized
independently at numerous times and in numerous places in prehistory. We do not know
when in antiquity this occurred. Objects of fired clay probably were made and used in the
Old World Paleolithic period (which ended about 10,000-8,000 BC) but the archeological
record of such events is scant at best. Clay was fashioned into images of animals in
Upper Paleolithic caves about 40,000-12,000 BC. Unfired clay, such as adobe and
plaster, for example, became a common construction ingredient by 10,000 years ago in
Mesopotamia. When adobe-plastered structures burned, the burned plaster and bricks
became soft stone. Uses of fired clay began about 10,000 years ago, are now well
documented, especially in Mesopotamia. Clay in the Old World was shaped into
numerical symbols, figurines, weights, and simple pottery vessels by 8,000 BC. In most
places in the Middle East, however, pottery does not appear consistently in the

4
archeological record until about 6,000 BC. The development of pyrotechnology
(technology of fire) about 1500 BC allowed artisans to develop draft kilns and glazes.
Combined with the invention of the potter’s wheel, these techniques transformed the
production of pottery from that of the hand-made cottage artisan to the industrial
craftsman.
The earliest clay artifacts to appear in Texas were not pottery containers. Clay
figurines, both fired and unfired and perhaps dating as early as 1,500-2,000 BC, have
been recovered from the lower Pecos River region (Figure 1). Also, fired clay balls were
substituted for stone and used in cooking hearths throughout southeast Texas and
Louisiana (see Figure 2) in Late Archaic and Woodland periods (ca. 2,000 BC-AD 900).
The used clay balls are perhaps best recognized at the impressive Poverty Point site in
northeastern Louisiana where different groups “personalized” their clay ball design.

date to about 1,500-2,000 B.C.

Archaic people of northeastern Louisiana. Similar clay balls were used among the Late
Archaic people of southeast Texas.

Pottery that was used as vessel containers developed independently in several
places in the New World. The earliest archeological evidence for pottery vessels comes
from Equador at approximately 2,500 BC and by 2,000 BC there were several areas
producing pottery, such as along the coasts of Columbia, Mexico, and the southeastern
United States. Pottery vessels do not appear in Texas until about 300 BC. These early
potters were part of the Tchefuncte pottery tradition and migrated westward from
southern Louisiana into southeast and east Texas (Figure 1). Shortly thereafter, plain
brownware pottery from the Southwest makes its way into far west Texas about AD 200,
if not earlier.

Summary
Pottery is one of the most common elements of material culture preserved in the
archeological record. Because pottery reflects one’s cultural tradition and stylistic trends,
and was used for so many functions from cooking, storage, serving, and in almost all
social contexts, including household, public, and ritual, much can be learned from
pottery analysis.

PART II
Pottery Technology

1

This section presents information on how pots are made. Pottery is made from
clay, but clays often have to be refined and mixed with other ingredients called temper
and water to create a suitable clay body. In non-industrial societies, the formula for
preparing clays, methods of building a vessel, vessel shape, techniques of decoration, and
how the pottery is used are all behaviors largely dictated by one’s culture and information
handed down through many generations. Once clay has been prepared, there are several
ways in which a pottery vessel can be formed.
Methods of forming a vessel depend, in part, on the relative scale of craft
production. People who make and use their own pottery customarily make it by hand.
Commercial producers use more efficient methods, such as the potter’s wheel or molds,
to produce standardized shapes and sizes. Vessel shape is directly related to use. Once
formed, pots can be decorated in an even greater variety of ways.
Cultural traditions also define the parameters in all of the steps mentioned above.
Since one tradition will differ from another, archeologists can identify specific potterymaking groups by the nuances expressed in the ceramics. Regardless of the tradition, it
all begins with the clay.
Clay
The basic ingredient of pottery is clay. Clay is the most common detritus mineral
on the earth’s surface, created by the breakdown of rocks through erosion and chemical
action. Clay particles are carried down small streams as suspended sediment into larger
streams or rivers and eventually into deltas. Clay particles make streams muddy after
heavy rains. Clay is classified as a hydrous silicate mineral composed mostly of
aluminum. The chemical formula for most clay is: H²0+Al²0³+SiO²+various impurities.
Clays are classed according to mineral origin such as kaolin, smectite (montmorillonite),
and illite groups. Kaolin is derived from feldspars and micas; smectite clays are bentonite
(sometimes called fuller’s earth), and illite clays are common in marine shale. Kaolinite
clays, composed mostly of kaolin, are especially suitable for ceramics in that they do not

8
have high absorption or swell-shrink capacity. Illite clays are other very fine clays and
make good pottery clays.
Clays occur across all of Texas. Most of the clays in east and southeast Texas and
along the coastal plain are largely derived from ancient marine deposits (illite). Clays
from the Wilcox group which outcrops in a curving band that parallels the coast from
Marshall (home of the well known Marshall Pottery), Rockdale, Elgin, San Antonio, and
D’Hanis, are among the best pottery clays in the state (Figure 4). Most historic pottery
and brick factories were located along this formation.

major source of commercial clays in the state.

Preparation
Rarely can clays be used immediately after quarrying. Most clays require some
preparation before they are used to make pottery. Raw clays may be first ground on a
metate (or other grinding stone) and screened to remove rocks and other foreign
materials. The clay is then mixed with water, stirred and soaked in a container to let the
coarser particles and impurities separate. Once separated, the clay is then allowed to dry
for storage. Clay may be wetted, kneaded, wrapped in a cloth to “cure” for a period of
time, or the dry clay may be ground and mixed with temper and water for use.

9
Temper
Even though clays may be good for making pottery, they contain an inherent
problem called the swell-shrink factor. Clay can shrink nine percent or more when it
dries, creating cracks that often result in the unfired vessel falling apart. To overcome this
problem, and to give the vessel added strength to endure the firing, potters add granular
substances to the clays to help hold the pot together during drying and firing. This added
substance is temper.

Figure 5. Temper in ceramic technology is not something that you lose.

Temper may be sand, bits of ground potsherds or fired clay (called grog), ground
bits of burned bone, ground up burned shell, fabric, or even Spanish moss. Of these
tempers, sand and grog are better suited for withstanding higher temperatures. Bone,
shell, and gypsum do not serve well in higher temperatures because they tend to calcify
and literally explode. Gypsum and limestone are especially bad since they continue to
absorb moisture long after firing, resulting in potlids popping out of the matrix. Potlids
are the result of expansion of impurities in the clay. The impurity often can be seen at the
bottom of the potlid. This process is called “pinging” because of the sound made when
the event occurs (Figure 6).

10

Figure 6. Ping mark in modern brick from D’Hanis, Texas. Notice the nodule of limestone whose
expansion caused the fracture to occur (photo H. Shafer).

Use of fiber as temper, especially Spanish moss, was characteristic of the earliest
pottery in the Southeastern United States. Fiber obviously burns out eventually and
leaves a characteristic spongy texture (Figure 7). The advantage of fiber temper is
difficult to understand since it seemingly defeats the purpose of adding strength. The one
possible advantage is that it keeps the vessel together during the drying process when the
clay is subjected to the highest shrinkage. Use of fiber temper was an early ceramic
tradition dating back some 2500 years that extended across much of the southeastern
United States and as far north as Nebraska.

Figure 7. Fiber-termpered ware from Georgia2

The kinds of temper used were among those bits of technological knowledge
learned from mentors, usually women on a girl’s lineage. How much temper to use
depended on the behavior of the clay itself, which can be quite varied, as well as how the
vessel was to be used. A coarser body might be required for cooking pots because of the
thermal shock they are subjected to, while a finer body may be desired for water jars.

11
How to gather and prepare the clay, knowing just how much temper and water to
add to the dry clay body constituted a recipe. The late Rose Gonzales from San Ildefonse
Pueblo in New Mexico mixed half sand temper and half clay. Firing success depended on
doing all the right steps, and potters took great pains to maintain as much control on the
variables as possible. Consequently, traditional sources for clay and temper continued to
be used, and the locations were often kept secret.
Making Pots
Cultural traditions and economic conditions define customary ways of making a
pottery vessel. Pottery was hand made in non-industrial societies using one of several
basic techniques: pinch pots, coiling and scrape, or paddle and anvil. Industrial
production of pottery originated with the invention of the potter’s wheel in which a
turning device was used to create a centrifugal force that allowed the potter to form the
vessel, and to mass produce vessels of consistent size and shape. Pottery that was
imported and made by the colonial powers (France, England, Spain, Holland, and
Portugal) during the subsequent colonization of the New World was produced on these
potters wheels. Each of these methods is described below.

Pinch Pots
Making a pinch pot is the simplest method of making a pottery vessel. It involves
taking a ball of clay and creating a cavity with the fist. The vessel is then formed by using
the fingers and thumb and pressing the walls to form the vessel (Figure 8). Pinch pots are
not symmetrical or evenly thinned or shaped. They are crude but serviceable when fired.

12

Figure 8. Making a pinch pot.3

Coil and Scrape
There is little doubt that basketry served as an inspiration for ceramic technology
once the notion and basic information was acquired. One widely used method of forming
a basket was by coiling. Coiling is also a common technique of building up a pottery
vessel. The vessel is begun by forming long ropes of clay and simply forming a spiral
around the curled center (Figure 9). The potter periodically stops to weld the coils
together by pinching them with her fingers to a relatively uniform thickness. As she
builds the walls higher, she will began using a sherd or gourd scraper to scrape diagonally
across the welded coils to achieve an even surface and uniform thickness. She will scrape
both the interior and exterior surfaces.

Figure 9. Bottom of a corrugated jar showing the unsmoothed coil pattern used in its production4.

Paddle and Anvil
This technique of building a vessel calls for the use of a paddle supported on the
inside by an “anvil” which was a sherd or some other object with a curved surface
(Figure 10). Slabs of clay are welded and paddled to an even thickness. The paddle and
anvil technique was used in manufacturing pottery in some ceramic traditions. It was

13
used to manufacture Borger Cordmarked pottery in the Texas Panhandle, and in the
Hohokam ceramic tradition of southern Arizona.

Figure 10. Drawing of a paddle (on the left) and anvil.

Wheel-thrown
The use of centrifugal force to form a pot requires some kind of turning device.
Modern potters use an electrical rotating table or “potter’s wheel.” In ancient times,
however, other sources of energy, such as one’s own feet (kick wheel), or an assistant,
were used to turn the wheel. The potter’s wheel was used exclusively in the Old World
until European colonization. According to Victor Bryant (Ceramics Today
www.ceramicstoday.com) simple wooden turntables probably were used before 3000 BC in

the old world and selected parts of Mesoamerica. Such devices are shown in ancient
Egyptian tomb paintings, and illustrate potters using a number of different versions of
turntables made from wood and stone. The potter’s wheel can be seen in the records and
pictures made by the Egyptians from about 2500 BC to Roman times. Below are scenes
which illustrate the essentials of the potters craft in ancient Egypt. The figures in Figure
11 below are redrawn from wall paintings in Egyptian tombs.

14

Figure 11. Egyptian using a turntable and an Egyptian God Khnum using a kick wheel (used with
permission from Victor Bryant, 2001, Ceramics Today).

In using a wheel, the ball of wet clay is placed on the center of the wheel.
Centering the ball is the key to successfully producing a vessel. Once properly centered,
the potter will create a hole in the center of the ball with one hand, and begin to pull the
wall of the vessel upward using both hands as the wheel is spinning to form a cylinder.
Centrifugal force keeps the vessel symmetrical as it is being pulled up. Vessel forms can
be achieved by pushing outward from the inside of the cylinder to make a globular vessel,
choking the vessel from the exterior with both hands near the rim to produce a jar form,
pulling the rim outward to produce a flaring rim or inward to produced a narrow-neck
rim. The options of form are limitless using the potter’s wheel. Once the vessel has been
formed to the satisfaction of the potter, a thin wire is used to cut the base from the wheel.
Use of the potter’s wheel also signifies mass production and standardization in
vessel form and volume. Pottery production became a craft guild in ancient times and the
use of the wheel usually correlates with cultures with market economies. It should not be
surprising that with a shift from cottage level production in preindustrial societies which
was in the hands of the women to commercial production men became involved with the
task. This is largely true today in Latin America where indigenous people still produce
some pottery. Even here, commercial production involves both men and women.

15
When looking at a sherd, how does one tell if the sherd was wheel thrown?
Sometimes this is not so easy, especially if the vessel has been smoothed over and glazed.
Wheel-thrown pottery usually has slightly uneven surfaces due to the spinning. While
centering the clay is crucial toward successful throwing of a vessel, it is never perfectly
centered nor is the pressure precisely evenly applied with the hands. As a consequence,
faint ridges or “rills” parallel to the rim and base are evident along the interior and
exterior of the vessel (Figure 12). Furthermore, it is usually obvious from the rim that a
vessel has been thrown by the striations caused by the finishing of the rim and symmetry.

Figure 12. Note the “rills” from wheel-throwing this olive jar.5

Ancient Maya potters used various devices to obtain rotary motion, pivoting, or
centrifugal force. Potters of the Yucatan rotated the base of an instrument call a kabal,
with their feet which created just enough centrifugal force to form a symmetrical rim.
Little women of the Guatemala Highlands, on the other hand, achieved the same results
by rotating themselves, called the orbiting technique, around a stationary vessel. Pueblo
potters in the Southwest and Mesoamerica used a bowl or sherd, called a puki, to form
the base and to turn the vessel by hand as it was being scraped and burnished (Figure 13).
Neither of these devices or techniques was as efficient as the wheel, although the kabal
comes closest to a New World version of the potter’s wheel. Pivoting devices such as the
molde employed by the potters of Coyotepec following the Spanish conquest, were
undoubtedly inspired by the Spanish potter’s wheel.

16

Figure 13. The late Rose Gonzales of San Ildefonso Pueblo using a puki to form the base of a
vessel (photo H. Shafer).

Molds
Ceramic molds are pre-prepared in the image of the vessel or object desired, and
the damp clay is pressed into the mold preparatory to firing. Molds may themselves be
ceramics such as stoneware, or they may be metal or stone, depending on the
circumstances. Most mold-made ceramics were cheaply mass produced for commercial
markets after industrialization in the 20th century, but mold-made figurines were
produced in Highland Mexico and South America in Postclassic times (after about A. D.
1200). Exclusive mold-made dolls and doll parts were popular items among the affluent
children during the Victorian era, and are valuable collector’s items today. Sherds of
these mold-made dolls often appear in late 19th and 20 century archeological contexts.
Ceramic Body, Porosity, Kilns, and Firing Range
Hardness and versatility of the ceramic body depends on a number of factors.
Primary among them are temperature and firing duration. Drying pottery before firing
removes most of the water in hydration, that is, the water between the clay particles that

17
give it plasticity. Firing removes the water in the molecular structure of the clay, thereby
changing the mineral structure of the clay particle itself. Firing causes clay particles to
fuse together rendering them stable and creating a ceramic, which is essentially a soft
metamorphic stone. The degree of firing and fusing determines the level of porosity. At
one extreme, the firing may result in vitrifying depending on the kiln temperature and
clay. Vitrifying is the process of becoming glass when clay particles are fused together in
an impervious homogenous mass. Pottery with a high degree of vitrification has a lower
the percentage of porosity or fewer pores in the body. Pottery with a high percentage of
porosity often seep liquids, while pottery with low percentage of porosity is impervious.
Certain clays do not hold up well under extremely hot temperatures and will
either crumble or melt, while others, such as pure kaolin clays, vitrify to the extent that
they become porcelain.
Kilns
Kilns are facilities used to fire pottery. The type of kiln used largely depended on
the level of technological sophistication or complexity of the culture involved. In most
subsistence oriented cultures around the world, pottery was fired in open-air fires (large
or small) or pit kilns. These ranged in size from that of a simple campfire in which a
single pot was fired, to a larger thermal facility constructed either in a pit or on the
ground specifically to fire dozens of pots. Regardless of the size or number of pots, the
construction was essentially the same: 1) a place was prepared for the vessels; 2) some
type of cover was placed around and over the vessels to protect them from direct
exposure to the fire; 3) fuel was stacked in and around the vessel cluster; 4) the fuel was
ignited and maintained for the duration desired; 5) the fire was allowed to burned down
and vessels were given a time to cool before exposing them to the air; and, 6) vessels
were removed.
The ability to create very hot kiln fires was something that occurred about the
time urban living came into being, about 3,000 BC in the Old World. Prior to that time,
cultures were only able to fire pottery in outdoor “campfire-type” kilns (Figures 14 and
15). In Texas, outdoor kilns were used throughout prehistory.

18

Figure 14. Native American potters using an outdoor kiln to fire terracotta pottery (photo

Figure 15 . Details of an outdoor kiln used by native peoples in Texas to produce terra cotta pots.

Maximum temperatures for outdoor kilns are generally well below 1000º C (or
from about 1300 to 1800º F). With such limitations, outdoor kilns can yield only terra
cotta wares. To obtain pottery fired at higher temperatures, such as earthenwares and
stonewares such as those used during the historic era, a more sophisticated kiln is
required. To achieve a hotter fire, it is necessary to create an air draft to bring in more
oxygen. Such kilns are designed to increase air flow by providing an opening or flue at
the top and an opening in front (Figure 16). As the fires burn, hot air rises, and draws
more air from the front. As the fire gets hotter and faster, the outflow is stronger and
more oxygen is brought in by the inflow.

19

based upon excavated examples.6

Duration of firing also is an important factor. Maintaining high temperatures in
open-air kilns is not as easy as with draft kilns whose fires can be stoked.
Body Categories
Body categories are defined on the basis of relative degree with which the clay
particles are fused. The lower fired ceramics, such as terra cotta, are barely fused and are
often porous. Bodies with vitrified clay particles are impervious. These categories, taken
from Table 1, are Terra Cotta, Earthenware, Stoneware, China and Porcelain. The latter
two are virtually indistinguishable and have semi-translucent bodies due to the high
degree of vitrification.

Terra Cotta
Pottery fired below 1000ºC is called terra cotta, and includes all pottery recovered
from Precolumbian America and early pottery throughout the world. The Native
Americans did not produce ceramics fired above 1000ºC because they had not developed
the pyrotechnology to achieve higher temperatures. Terra cotta is not vitrified, but is fired
enough to form a solid body. Thus, the body is porous and “leaks” liquids such as water.
Extended soaking will often cause a terracotta pot to crumble due to the lack of fusing of
the clay particles. These pots are especially suitable for cooking, however, and are just as
suitable for serving and storage of dry materials. Storage of liquids is possible if the clays
fuse well under lower temperatures or if the vessels are slipped and burnished, which
reduce leakage.
Earthenware
Pottery fired between 900 and 1200ºC is called earthenware. Earthenware can be
either glazed , unglazed, porous, or permeable. Like terracotta, the body is usually not
vitirified, but some clays began to vitrify if higher range of temperatures are reached in
the kiln. Body colors are usually red, brown, or gray. Spanish olive jars, tin enameled
majolica, and a variety of lead glazed vessels recovered from Spanish and French
colonial sites and Spanish missions in Texas all fall into the earthenware category.
Because of their porous body, glazing was often necessary to make vessels impermeable
for liquid storage.
Stoneware
The firing temperatures for stoneware are from about 1200 to 1350ºC. Partial
fusion or vitrification gives the body a stone-like quality. Their bodies are opaque, light
gray or brown, depending on the clays. Nineteenth and early twentieth century utility
stoneware were often glazed with lead and salt. The famous Wedgewood ware first
produced in England in the mid eighteenth century was among the finest stoneware made.
Two very fine classes of stoneware, creamware and pearlware, were developed by
Wedgewood. These very fine, thin wares were preferred fine dinnerware used throughout

21
the 19th century. Stonewares are widely produced today and constitute most of our fine
dinner ware. Improved technology in decorating stoneware resulted in the artisans
transferring prints and images onto the vessels (Figure 17).

China and Porcelain
The word “China” generally conjures an image of the finest dinnerware reserved
for special holiday feasts and weddings. The reason is that Chinese porcelain made of
white-firing kaolin clay (or “china clay”), quartz, and a mineral flux, is the finest ceramic
made. It is fired from between 1280 and 1400ºC. The body is translucent and has the
distinctive ring when tapped. Porcelain was produced in Ireland and other countries by
the nineteenth century. Faux china or “bone china” was produced in England in the late
eighteenth century using bone ash. The translucency of the Chinese vessels was achieved,
but the hardness was not.
Kiln Wasters
Rarely do all vessels make it through the firing process. The worst sound a potter
can hear is the very distinctive “thump” in a closed kiln. With this sound, you know that a
pot has exploded and may have taken out most of the other vessels. The causes are
several. Improper drying can cause shrinking. Steam or fugitive minerals such as gypsum
can swell during firing. All result in failure. Behind every commercial kiln is a big pile of

22
sherds and vessel parts, called “kiln wasters.” Archeologists rarely have the opportunity
to discover such a pile, but when they do, it is a gold mine of information. In native
cultures, large sherds were often recycled and used as dishes, covers, palettes, or shallow
containers, leaving little left for the archeologist. A probable kiln wasted Mimbres Style
II bowl is shown in Figure 18.

Summary
The transformation of common clay to a beautiful ceramic is a complicated
process that can be accomplished in relatively simple manner. Raw clays are prepared by
soaking, settling, or simply by drying and grinding. All clays have varying swell-shrink
qualities that work against successful forming, drying, and firing. To overcome this
deficiency, potters add temper, a foreign substance, to the clay to help hold the paste
together during drying and firing. Pots can be formed by simply pinching out a bowl from
a ball of clay, coiling and scraping, paddle and anvil, using a potters wheel, or mold.
Once completed, the vessel can be fired in a simple campfire, a larger bonfire, or pit-fired
outdoor kiln. These kilns produce low-fired pottery because there is no control on how
much oxygen can get to the fuel. All prehistoric Native American kilns fall into this
category. Draft kilns are designed to provide a flow of air to increase oxygen input and a
hotter fire. The use of draft kilns usually correlates with mass production and ceramic

23
craft specialization during the rise of urban civilizations in the Old World, and were not
part of the Native American ceramic technology.
The initial utilitarian function for ceramics was containers for cooking, serving,
and storage. As the roles for pottery changed to include uses outside the home where the
pottery was visible to others, potters began to decorate their pots in a variety of ways.
Part III examines many of the ways in which ceramics were decorated and embellished.

PART III
Decoration
Potters use a variety of methods and techniques to embellish their products. There
are three basic reasons why pottery is embellished: functional, aesthetic, and symbolic.
All three reasons apply in the world of archeological ceramics. Knowledge of the kinds
and patterns of decoration is useful in sorting and classifying pottery, and identifying
certain pottery traditions. Decorations provide a quick and easy way of recognizing the
product of a particular cultural group.
Functional embellishments for terra cottas and some earthenwares include
methods and techniques for roughening the exterior surface (brushing, incising,
punctating, stamping, appliquéing, and corrugating). Included under this heading are
appendages such as nodes, handles, feet, and anything else added to the original vessel.
Aesthetic embellishments are designs added at any stage of manufacture. Aesthetics may
include any form of decoration that enhances the quality and appearance of the vessel.
Pottery also is a medium for displaying symbols. Symbols are intended to convey
messages. Symbols depicted in the design fields may convey political (emblematic), clan
or group (totemic), or sacred (ideological) messages (Figure 19). The intent of the symbol
was to communicate some kind of message to members within and outside one’s group.

wings after rain to the eyes of Tlaloc, a rain deity. The buzzard may also be a totem (photo

25
Decorations can be applied while the clay is wet, leather hard, or dry. In addition,
surface color and texture can be altered by adding slips, painting the surface, painting a
slip, or by adding yet another coat of substance called a glaze. As you can see, there are
many ways to embellished the surface and create designs. For the sake of this workshop
and simplicity of discussion, I have divided these methods into the categories of wet
paste, leather hard, dry, and biscuit.
Wet Paste
Wet paste decorations are applied while the ceramic body is still wet but firm.
Wet paste designs are almost always applied on the exterior surfaces. Exceptions include
ceramic grater bowls or molcajetas (bowls with roughened interiors used to grind chilies)
in Mesoamerica.
One of the most common methods of surface embellishment is brushing. Brushed
patterns may occur vertically or diagonally, and are intended to roughen the surface. On
cooking pots, the brushing increases the surface exposure and may have created a more
efficient vessel for heating foods. Brushing often occurs in combination with other wet
paste techniques.
Instruments such as the tip of a bone awl or a pointed stick can be used to carve or
incise designs into the wet past (Figure. 20). Rectangular, curvilinear, and other patterns
can be created using the vessel surface as a canvas. Incising may occur alone or in
combination with other wet paste techniques.

collections, courtesy www.texasbeyondhistory.net). 1

26
Punctating
Punctating a pattern by repeatedly pressing the end of an instrument into the clay
is another popular wet paste method of decorating. Punctated patterns may occur alone or
in combination with incised motifs, creating zone punctate, or punctated-incised, patterns.
Wet paste patterns such as punctating or punctating and incising around the necks of
cooking jars may have helped in securing them with tongs as they were removed from the
fire (Figure 21, A and B).

neck of a jar3.

Stamping
Somewhat related to punctated is the method of stamping a motif or design into
the plastic surface. Stamped patterns are not common in Texas ceramics, but do occur on
Cowhide Stamped, a zone stamped pattern used among certain Arkansas Caddo groups

27
(Figure 22). Stamping also occurs on certain rare Tchefuncte wares and Woodland
period Marksville Stamped sherds and vessels in east and southeast Texas. On
Tchefuncte wares, stamped designs include those made by a curved instrument that is
“rocked” across the surface (Figures 23 and 24), creating a rocker-stamping motif. In
Marksville Stamped, the stamp motif occurs in combination with broad-line incising to
highlight the motif (Figure 25).

Caddo groups4.

Figure 25. Marksville Stamped vessel from Coral Snake Mound, Louisiana7.

Appliqué
Appliqué is a method of affixing additional clay to the wet surface to create a
raised element or pattern. Very often, this appliqué is itself decorated (Figure 26). Ribs,
curvilinear patterns, nodes, appendages, and handles are all classed as appliquéd
elements. In this discussion, the interest is on decorative, rather than functional features.

Figure 26. Appliquéd Caddoan jar with punctated neck8.

29
Cord-marking
Cord-marking is yet another way of roughening the exterior surface of a vessel.
It involves the use of a twisted cord that is either warped around the vessel creating a
cord impression on the clay, or a cord-wrapped paddle that leaves a cord-marked pattern.
Borger Cordmarked in the Texas Panhandle is an excellent example of the latter (Figure
27). Another application of cord-marking involves using a twisted cord string to impress
one or more lines around the rim. Certain Goose Creek vessels were “incised” in this
manner.

Figure 27. Borger Cordmarked jar roughened with a cord-wrapped paddle9.

Neck Banding and Corrugating
These methods are discussed together since they are technologically related. Neck
banded and corrugated pots are made by the coil and scrape method. In neck banded
vessels, the coils used to build the neck are left un-scraped on the exterior; the body of
the vessel and interior surfaces are smoothed and scraped (Figure 28). The coils around
the neck may be partly smoothed, but the neck banded effect is much the same.
Corrugated pots are constructed much the same way. Ropes of clay are left unsmoothed
or partially smoothed where the corrugations are wanted. Some corrugated styles have
indented patterns in the corrugations that also form designs (Figure 29). Corrugations
may cover the entire exterior surface except for the lip (fully corrugated; Figure 30 left)
or just the shoulder (partially corrugated; Figure 30 right).

Figure 30. Mimbres Corrugated jars; fully corrugated (left) and partially corrugated
(right).

Leather Hard Paste
Letting a vessel dry to a leather hard state is necessary when burnishing a vessel.
Burnishing requires the use of a smooth object such as a polished pebble. The pebble is
rubbed back and forth over the entire surface. The process pulls the finest particles of
clay to the surface, resulting in a very smooth, shiny finish (Figure 31). It is the same
effect that masons use to smooth the surface of concrete with a mason’s trowel.

31

Figure 31. The shiny black finish on this small jar is due to burnishing. The potter chose to paint
over part of the burnished surface to create the subtle design.

Dry Paste
Dry paste techniques are those applied to the surface of the vessel after drying.
Two dry paste methods are discussed: engraving and excising. Both are somewhat
related in that they result in carving the surface. Engraving is done with a sharp-edge or
pointed instrument and the design is carved out. Sections of the design may be excised.
Both engraving and excising were widely used by the ancient Caddo potters. Engraved
vessels were also highly burnished, and the engraved and excised areas were often filled
with red ochre or white kaolin to produce a striking aesthetic effect (Figure 32).

Figure 32. Holly Fine Engraved vessel showing the effects of engraving, excising, and
burnishing.11

32
Slips
Slips are a fugitive clay-based solution applied to the surface of a vessel after it is
dry to alter the color (Figure 33). Most clays fire unevenly to a brown or gray color in
open-air kilns. Even commercial clays may not fire to the color desired by the potter.
Slips provide an even color which is the goal, or the slip may itself be the canvass onto
which designs are painted. Slips are often burnished as well.

Figure 33. Pueblo Indian potter applying a slip to a vessel (photo H. Shafer).

Paints
Paints used by native potters were mostly mineral based although carbon based
paints were also used. For example, in the Mesa Verde area of the American Southwest,
syrup rendered from bee weed and mixed with a manganese paste was used as paint. The
bee weed syrup served as a binder and burned off in firing. Mineral paints usually are
iron or manganese based and fire to reds or blacks, depending on how the vessel is fired.
Galena powder (crushed lead crystals) were mixed with iron or manganese based paints
in the middle Rio Grande Valley in late Pueblo times to produce a glaze paint. Paint
colors also depended on the firing atmosphere. Oxidized atmosphere yielded browns and
reds. Reducing atmosphere produced more vivid colors, including black. Other paint
colors, such as yellows, white, and blue were achieved using minerals that produced these
hues under various firing conditions.

33
Bisque or Biscuit Ware
Bisque or biscuit ware is earthenware or stoneware pottery that goes through two
stages of firing. The first or biscuit, fires the vessel to fix the shrinkage prior to glazing.
The second firing melts the glaze.
Glazes
Glazes consist of a liquid substance applied to the surface of a previously fired or
biscuit-fired vessel. The glaze is a glassy coating that melts onto the surface of the vessel.
Certain mineral constituents of the glaze provide color in oxidizing or reducing
atmospheres, and other elements serve as a flux to lower melting point. Glazes are of
several kinds, depending on the techniques and minerals used. Salt, lead, and tin enamel
are discussed here as examples. These are among the more common glazes encountered
in historic ceramics.
Salt Glazing
The story goes that sometime in the 1400s, a German potter used brine soaked
woods to fuel his kiln for a biscuit firing. He was quite surprised when he opened the kiln
to discover his pots were covered with a beautiful clear glaze. This potter had discovered
salt glazing. We don’t know if this story is true or not, but salt glazing dates to about this
time in Europe. In salt glazing, vessels are heated to the point of vitrification and salt is
thrown into the kiln to produce the glaze. The decomposed salt fuses with the paste. The
chloride in the salt reacts with all hot surfaces in the kiln and the sodium serves as the
flux. Of course, everything in the kiln gets glazed in this process, including the kiln walls.
Lead and Tin
Lead glazed pottery has it origins in the 9th and 10th century in Roman times, and
was used extensively in colonial times in the New World. It continues to be made and
imported today from Mexico and other places. Lead powder is used to create the clay
melts at the temperature of earthenware kilns. One has to be very careful with lead glazed
vessels because of the concern with lead poisoning.

34
Tin enamel earthenware was first produced in the Middle East in an effort to
copy Chinese porcelains. The stoneware paste was glazed with a white tin-enamel and
hand painted with simple cobalt blue floral and geometric motifs. This technology made
its way to the Iberian Peninsula where it evolved into a ware commonly known as
majolica and into France were faience was made (Figures 34 and 35). Both classes of
tin-enameled earthenware majolica and faience appear in 18th and 19th century colonial
sites in Texas. Both are refined earthenwares that are called tin-glazed because tin was
added to the lead-based glaze to produce an opaque white surface. Both Spanish and
Portuguese majolica and French faience potters developed many different decorative
styles. Some of these styles were very elaborate while others were quite simple; the latter
appear in Spanish colonial sites throughout Texas and were used as common plates and
other vessels.

35

Transfer Prints
The term transferware is used to describe ceramics decorated by transfer
printing. The print design is etched onto a metal plate and inked onto a special tissue. The
inked tissue is placed onto the biscuit fired vessel which is then glazed and fired again12,
transferring the print to the paste. The design becomes fixed into the glaze during the
second firing (Figure 36).

Figure 36. Nineteenth century transferware plate13.

Spongeware
Spongeware is earthenware or stoneware decorated by using a sponge dipped in
the paint solution and stamped or dabbed onto the surface of the vessel (Figure 34). This
decorative technique was developed in Scotland and was popular in the nineteenth
century and early twentieth century and is sometimes found on nineteenth century sites in
Texas.

36

Figure 37. Nineteenth century spongeware14.

Kiln Atmosphere
Normally decorations are done prior to firing, but the effects of certain
decorations are not achieved until they are fired. The desired results also depend on
controlling the firing atmosphere. There are two ways of doing this, oxidized and reduced
firing.
Oxidizing Atmosphere
Oxidized firing occurs in atmospheres that allow a free flow of air that brings
oxygen into contact with the pottery. The oxygen combines with elements such as iron to
produce clear colors. Reds and browns are among the hues achieved under oxidizing
conditions.
Reduced Atmosphere
Reduction firing occurs when kiln atmospheres are starved of oxygen and more
carbon is produced than can be burned. Not allowing oxygen to enter into the kiln at peak
temperature can produce very desirable results, such as the polished black vessel shown
below (Figure 38). The kiln is allowed to burn as usual, but at a critical point in the firing,
the fire is smothered which allows all of the oxygen to become consumed, creating a
carbon dense atmosphere in the kiln. This free carbon then combines with the clay
elements, producing the dark results. Another term for this process is smudging (Figure

37
39). More vivid colors and color contrasts are produced under reduced conditions. The
downside is that one reducing agent is carbon monoxide. This was not a problem in openair and pit kilns but can be a problem with enclosed gas fired kilns.

Figure 38. This highly burnished black bowl by Maria Martinez of San Ildefonso Pueblo, New
Mexico shows the results of reduced firing or smudging15.

Figure 39. Characteristic of Reserve Filet Rim bowls is the intentionally smudged interior created
by a form of reduced firing16.

Fire Clouds
Uneven splotches of black seen on an otherwise brown finish, or gray splotches
on a white finish, are fire clouds (Figure 40). Fire clouds are caused when the fuel
comes into contact with the vessel at or after the point of maximum kiln temperature. If
this contact occurs earlier in the firing process, subsequent heating may remove the
clouds. Thus, fire clouds occur at that point in the firing process when the hues become
fixed.

38

Figure 40. Dark splotches on this white-slipped Mimbres Style III jar are fire clouds caused by
the fuel coming into contact with the jar during firing (photo H. Shafer).

Summary
Decorations can serve several basic purposes, functional, aesthetic, and symbolic.
Functional decorations aid in providing more efficient uses of the vessel such as
roughening the exterior of a cooking pot. Potters are artisans or artists and take pride in
their work since they know it will be viewed and judged by others, from in-laws to
clients. Therefore, aesthetics often comes into play in decorating pottery. Pottery is used
in many contexts; utilitarian contexts around the household; serving and display during
public feasting; and, in shrines and other religious and sacred contexts. In the public
arena, decorated pottery can serve as a medium for displaying symbols and icons that
carry specific meanings to the viewers.
Once formed, a vessel may be decorated in a variety of ways, while the paste is
wet, leather hard, dry, or biscuit. While wet, the pottery can embellish the vessel with
incised lines, punctuations, stamped impressions, cord-marked patterns, corrugations or
appliqué. The vessel can be burnished in a leather-hard state to a lustrous finish. Once
dried, the surface may be slipped. The slip may serve as a canvass for painting, or stand
alone. Paints can be applied directly onto the fabric. Certain decorative techniques, such
as glazes, are applied only after the vessel has undergone low firing to form the clay. This
low firing process is called biscuit firing or bisque ware. The bisque vessel is then dipped
into a solution of clay and other elements that make up the glaze base. This mixture
contains a substance such as lead powder, bone ash or borax that serves as a flux to create
a glassy texture to the glaze. The reason for the bisque firing is that the paste will shrink
when fired. If the glaze is applied prior to the bisque firing, the final firing will fail
because the glaze, which shrinks very little or none at all, will separate from the paste. To

39
avoid this, the paste is, so to speak, preshrunk. Certain decorative techniques, such as
transfer printing and sponge stamping require the vessel to be fired prior to application.

PART IV
Sherd Analysis
We now have defined pottery and ceramics, and explained how pottery is made
and decorated. It is time to discuss the archeology of pottery. The first step is to establish
order within the sherd collection. The sherd collection will be sorted and a classification
system will be imposed. The anatomy of a vessel will be described and the vessel will be
deconstructed into sherds. The procedures of how archeologists work from sherds to
understand the types, form, size, and ages of the vessels represented in the sherd
assemblage will be described in this section of the workbook.
Anyone interested in archeology and art history finds native pottery vessels to be
aesthetically intriguing, especially if great artistic skill is evident in the formation and
decoration. The fact is that archeologists rarely have the opportunity to study whole
vessels. Archeologists more frequently study potsherds (potshards). Most stories found in
pottery are revealed through the analysis of potsherds. Sherds can reveal the time period
in which the vessel was made, type and size of vessel, and for what purpose it was it
made. This may seem to be a lot asked of a lowly potsherd, but sherds can tell a lot of
stories.
Sherd analysis requires one to examine sherds from several different perspectives.
There is no one way of examining sherds, and the method or methods chosen depend on
the questions asked and the information sought. Sherds may be examined for:
1. Attributes
2. Types, Varieties, Styles
3. Chronology
4. Vessel forms, sizes, volumes
5. Temper
6. Clays
The first step in gathering information about a collection of potsherds is to
establish order. This all begins with sorting the collection and establishing a classification
system.

41

Pottery Classification
Archeologists use a number of classificatory tools when it comes to pottery. You
may hear such terms as types, varieties, styles, and wares, or cooking pots, water jars,
bottles, and so forth. These are all classificatory tools that serve a purpose. In pottery
analysis, one analytical tool does not fit all because pottery traditions vary. Some pottery
traditions emerge over a short period of time in an area and for whatever reason fade
away or blend with other traditions and lose their distinctive attributes and identity. The
result is that some pottery types occur over a short period of time, while others last for
long periods of time.
Classification begins by grouping like objects in a class based on shared
attributes. An attribute consists of a distinguishable trait such as color, texture, form,
temper, surface treatment, decorative mode, or anything else that is observable (Figure
41). Each of these groups with shared attributes may be subdivided into established types
identified on the basis of previous work in the region (see Figure 41). In archeological
classifications, a type represents a particular artifact group that shares a cluster of
attributes. Types may be descriptive, based on morphology (form), technology (ware), or
function.

42

Descriptive Types
Classification schemes used in chronological studies in prehistoric analyses are
descriptive, and related to a set of shared attributes summarized in a formal type name
(e.g., Holly Fine Engraved). Descriptive types, while considered by some to be analytical
constructs of the archeologist, were created within cultural traditions and, by definition,
are definable in time and space. For that reason, descriptive types, especially those
sensitive to change through time (such as pottery) are useful as chronological index
markers and in defining regional patterns. Equally important, types help archeologists to
communicate information.

Figure 42. Sorting sherds on the basis of types.

How does a descriptive type come to be? A pottery type is something that
archeologists see and was not something that the makers themselves necessarily
perceived. The makers were very much aware that they were making and designing pots
in accordance to rules handed down from generations. If any of you were ever taught a
recipe or procedures by your parents or grandparents, then you know that there was the
right way, wrong way, and grandfather’s or grandmother’s way. Novices learned to make
pottery in the same fashion. The clay and temper source, formula for mixing the

43
ingredients, how to form, cure, decorate, and fire the pots were all learned from
experiences and passed on to the next generation. The makers and users of the pots knew
who made them and where they were made. Hand craftsmen are usually very critical of
another’s work, and take great pride in their own. They could probably pick up more
differences among the potters in their community and society than archeologists might
because they were more concerned with following the rules in their respective social
sphere and village. Those rules were displayed on their crafts and they were judged on
them daily. Archeologists recognize the patterns created by potters following their rules.
We call these patterns: types; varieties; and, styles.
Technological Types
Technological types or wares are not nearly as time sensitive as descriptive types,
but do serve to designate ceramic traditions. Wares are based on composition,
manufacturing technology, or surface treatment. In Texas the term ware has been
informally applied to the sandy paste pottery of southeast Texas, and bone-tempered
applied to the pottery of central and east Texas. In the Southwest and Mesoamerica,
however, the term is used more formally, such as with Cibola Whiteware and Mogollon
Brownware (Southwest), or Fine Orange and Plumbate wares (Mesoamerica). Sherds
may be grouped into wares on the basis of the technological attributes used to identify
those wares.
Morphological Types
Morphological types are based on vessel form such as bowls, jars, mugs, pitchers,
bottles, and so forth. Bowls and jars can be of many different sizes and forms. Classifying
a sherd into a morphological type simply identifies the type of vessel the sherd
represents. Knowing the vessel type and their frequency with regards to other vessel
types may be useful information. The frequencies of bowls to jars in specific contexts, for
example, may be information important to the archeologist.

44
Functional Types
Functional types are based on assumed functional roles for a specific category of
vessels, such as cooking pots, water bottles, coffee cups, pitchers, or ladles. Form relates
to function, at least in part. Ethnographic and historical sources provide comparative
examples for the functional roles and contexts for many vessels forms, although the
assumed role is seldom the only role in which a particular vessel was used. Sherds are
classed into functional types based on the attributes that help to determine a specific
vessel class.
Varieties
A defined type may have recognized varieties (Figure 43). Each variety has the
basic attributes that define the type, but with an added set of attributes that distinguish it
from other varieties. Design variation is usually the main defining element of varieties.
Varieties also may have their own place in time and space, but all varietes of a single type
are encompassed within that defined for the type as a whole. Examples of established
types with possible varieties are shown in the following illustrations. The first type is
Poyner Engraved (Figure 43), a late Caddoan type that occurs in the upper Neches River
Valley and associated with the Frankston phase. The second type is Patton Engraved
(Figure 44), a protohistoric and historic Hasinai Caddo type from the middle Neches and
Angelina drainages. Patton is clearly derived from Poyner. The varieties of each are
based on vessel form and related design fields. The examples are not formal varieties, but
could very well be if they are shown to have separate distribution patterns in time or
space. Note the design fields differ for each vessel form, but the style of executing the
designs follows the same basic rules. The same applies to the Patton Engraved example
shown in Figure 44.

There is an obvious similarity in vessel form and design characteristics between
these two types, but the differences are recognizable. One major distinguishing
characteristic of Patton Engraved is the ticked line element. But how might we explain

46
the differences in design styles? One explanation, which has good ethnographic support,
is that the differences represent either different potters or different families of potters.
The Caddo lived in scattered villages or rancherias; one family may have resided a mile
or so from another. One potter may have learned her craft from her grandmother and
another from her grandmother; the differences you see may simply be differences that
distinguish one family’s potter from another family’s potter. A possible function of the
various designs within each variety was to identify the potter’s signature when the vessels
were used in public events such as feasts for which the Caddo were well known.
Styles
A style is a visual representation specific to a time and place, and is a decorative
embellishment that transmits information. Styles are somewhat equivalent to types and
varieties when used descriptively, but styles were created by the people and not by
archeologists as are types and varieties. We may never know the social meanings behind
styles, but styles are, nonetheless, recognizable. Cultural anthropologists have developed
some cross-cultural generalizations about styles, and this is why we know that styles
transmit information. More about style will be presented in Part V. Styles of hats, huipils,
dresses and water jar forms identify the villages and ethnic identity of women in
Guatemala and Peru. For whatever reason, styles change, and stylistic changes may
reveal a continuum in design evolution or reveal geographic variation within a type or
ware. An excellent example is with the Mimbres Black-on-white type (Figure 45). Design
changes formed a continuum of styles from A. D. 800-1140. Note the design style
evolution from simple to complex.

Styles may also correlate with changes in vessel form as well as design through
time as is seen with El Paso Polychrome jars. Jar forms evolved through three rim styles
from A.D. 1100-1400 (Figure 46). Different design layouts accompanied each rim style
change. El Paso Polychrome rim styles, like Mimbres design styles, can be used for
cross-dating purposes.

Anatomy of a Vessel
One of the first steps in sherd sorting is to determine the part of the vessel
represented by a sherd. The vessel’s anatomy provides the terminology for sorting sherds
and segregating those sherds that provide most information (Figure 47).

Lip
Rim

Shoulder
Body
Base

Figure 47. Anatomy of a pottery vessel. Each section of the vessel is identified by surface
curvature, decoration, and presence of physical attributes. A sherd broken from the rim will have
the lip intact.

Sherd Anatomy Attributes
Recognizing sherd attributes that relate to the vessel’s anatomy requires paying
attention to detail. Body sherds have all broken edges. A rim sherd is identified by the
presence of a rim segment which has a smooth edge and by the curvature. Bases are
usually thicker and have at least one juncture with the body, giving the sherd an abrupt
angle. Appendages such as handles and lugs usually break away due to their solid mass or
form and are usually readily identifiable.
Rim Sherds
Rim sherds often carry more diagnostic attributes that body or base sherds do, and
decorations are apt to occur near the rims of vessels. Rims can be rounded, flat, beveled
inside or outside, incurved, straight, out-curved, or flared (Figure 48). If the rim sherd is

49
large enough, vessel form and orifice diameter can be determined by placing the rim
against a graduated series of calibrated arcs (Figure 49).

Figure 48. Rim sherd profiles showing potential variations.

Body Sherds
Body sherds are apt to possess important attributes regarding vessel form,
technology, design, and size. Curvature, differences in interior and exterior finish, and
wall thickness are attributes that may help to determine if the sherd came from bowl, jar,
mug, or bottle. Designs on body sherds may be distinctive enough to assign the sherd to a
formal type. If the sherd is large enough, curvature may help to assess approximate vessel
size.
Base Sherds
Base sherds are the least sensitive to change with regards to sherd class. Bases
generally reflect a traditional mode as expressed in vessel form (Figure 49). Change is
more likely to occur in rim style and decorative motifs. Also, base sherds tend to be
thicker than the body sherds that derive from vessel walls.

50

Figure 49. Vessel profiles showing various base forms.

Sorting and Describing Sherds
The first step is to see what is in a sherd collection. The sherd collection can be
sorted using several independent criteria. There is no one method that is preferred over
any other because each sherd sample is different, and the analysts may not be asking the
same questions. The sorting scheme used here is based on attributes and types and is
merely an example of how one collection might be sorted.
For example, the analyst may be looking at the question of how two nearby
villages related to each other. He/she may suspect that they traded vessels and, if so,
vessel attributes such as paste, form, and decoration will reveal the amount of trade. In
this case each separate group of sherds clustered on the basis of shared attributes should
be described. The order of description should follow logically based on clusters of shared
attributes (Figure 50), for example, paste categories such as sand tempered or bone
tempered would constitute the first class in sorting. Within that class, plain and decorated
sherds are separated, and the decorated sherds are sorted by decoration mode (incised,
engraved, etc.). If vessel forms such as bowls or jars can be distinguished within each of
these clusters, they too need to be numerated. Finally, type names are assigned where
possible.
The seven steps below suggest how a collection might be sorted and described.

51
1.

Place all sherds on a table (be sure they are already labeled with
provenience) and sort like sherds with like sherds using visible attributes
such as paste categories (bone, grog, grit, and sand).

2.

Among each paste category, sort out plain from decorated.

3.

Among the decorated, sort out the kinds of decorations, for example, red
slipped, painted, punctated, punctated-incised, and engraved.

4.

Sort out the part of the vessel represented in each decorative category,
such as rims, body, and base sherds.

5.

Determine the kinds of vessels represented in the collection such as
bowls, jars, bottles, etc., and separate them.

6.

Define the types represented. If you cannot determine the type of a group
of punctated incised or engraved sherds, for example, then simply
describe them as untyped punctated incised, and untyped engraved.

7.

Describe each sherd cluster following the order used in sorting.

Typically sherds are very small in east Texas sites, yet they are, more often than
not, able to be typed. Sherds also may be small in central and west Texas sites, but in
these areas pottery is often plain and sorting is often done on the basis of paste or ware
characteristics. Therefore, sherd size may not be an obstacle in classification.

The sherd sorting for the Texas Panhandle region will largely depend on the time
period. In the northern Panhandle, usually there is one type, Borger Cordmarked, in
Antelope Creek phase sites. In later sites, however, the situation can be quite complicated
due to the importation of wares from the Pueblo region of New Mexico and even from
the Prairie Caddo of central and western Oklahoma and Texas. In contrast, ceramics from
far west Texas are much better defined than those from the Panhandle-South Plains
region. The model shown in Figure 51 is an example of how one may sort sherds in a
collection of ceramics from a multi-component pithouse-pueblo site in the El Paso

Once your sherds have been sorted into like groups, identify the types present in the
prehistoric sample using a local ceramic guides, or standard reference guides for historic
pottery. The guides you need depend on the area and time. The following listing of
references for prehistoric ceramics will help you gain a start (see bibliography for full

Organizing Sherd Data
Once sherds have been classified according to type, variety, and styles, plot the
distributions within the site or sites. How this is done depends on the source of the data,
that is, sherds collected through site survey and surface collections, test pits, or
excavations. Table 2 is an example of how this might be done. This hypothetical sample
came from an imaginary test pit excavated in southeast Texas, and records the
distribution of Tchefuncte and Goose Creek wares in the unit.
Once we have determined the distribution of all sherds, including types and
varieties, it is now time to use the sherd data to address specific issues. For this exercise,
three issues will be considered: chronology, vessel function, and assemblage
composition.

Chronology
In this hypothetical case, we are interested in change through time. Thus, the first
step in testing to see if your site was occupied long enough to reflect changes in the
ceramics, and to see if the deposits at your site have stratigraphic integrity is to examine
the sherd distribution data in Table 2 to see if differences in the vertical distribution of
sherds exist. They do. Next, the types in the sherd collection are placed in general time
periods based on ceramic cross-dating and other chronological information. Here you
must rely on published literature or personal experience. Some people find this to be an
intimidating process, but it need not be if you consider these important points. First, if
you identify a similar sherd or vessel in a typological guide or site report that closely
matches the specimen or specimens that you have, then you have made a descriptive
match. Second, to be assured that your sherds fit that type, the two examples must be
from the same area or peripheral to the area for the identified type. Pots can move around
so a clearly Caddoan type can occur in central Texas or along the southeast Texas coast.
Conversely, a Rio Grande Glazeware sherd can show up in Floydada, Texas. These
exceptional sherds usually account for less that 2 percent of any collection. If you feel
comfortable with the classification, use it and see how other things in the collection
match up.

56
Once the sherds have been classified according to type, the next step is to see how
sherds of each type are distributed throughout the site. Let us assume, for example, that
we have dug a deep test excavation at another site and we found sherds down through
level 9. Our classifications showed that we have three types. Figure 52 shows the
frequency of each type by level, and by ordering these frequencies by type and level we
created what archeologists have called “battleship curves.” This simple plotting revealed
the relative ordering of the three types through time by plotting the relative frequency of
each type in each level. Type A is the earliest in time at the site, followed by Type B, and
later by Type C. While we do not have absolute dates yet for the time span of each type,
relative ordering is the first step in building a ceramic chronology.

Figure 52. Seriation graphs showing the frequency distribution of typed sherds by level based on
the number of sherds of each type in each level.

The next step is comparing the findings at this site with that of other sites in the
region to extend and refine the ceramic sequence. Figure 53 is an actual seriation of
ceramics from cemetery sites that I did from five Late Prehistoric and Proto-Historic
Caddoan sites, Hood, Cook, Freeman, J. Allen, and Patton, located along the upper
Neches River. The frequency graph represents the numerical frequencies of types and
varieties among the five sites. Patton Engraved, which occurs with Spanish Colonial

57
material, was later than Poyner Engraved, a prehistoric type. Ceramic seriation
establishes a relative order of popularity of types through time, and by extension, the sites
in which those types are represented can also be placed in relative order of time.

Figure 53. Results of cemetery lot seriation of Caddoan pottery vessels from the middle Neches
River Valley.

Once a relative order of ceramics has been established through seriation, refined
dating of that order is possible when typed ceramics are recovered from deposits dated by
radiocarbon, tree-ring, or other accurate methods. There are opportunities in archeology
when stratigraphy and precise dating methods makes this possible. An excellent example
is in the Mimbres Valley of New Mexico where a superimposed architecture sequence
dating from ca. A.D. 650-1140 is documented at the NAN Ranch Ruin. The sequence of
rooms provided the context for ceramics recovered on the floors and from burials placed
beneath the floors. The precision in dating using tree-rings helped to establish a very
tightly dated ceramic chronology (Figure 54). Date ranges for the pottery styles, some of
which are no longer than 40 years, are so precise that styles themselves now serve as
cross-dating tools. Figure 45 shows this well dated stylistic sequence and Figure 54
shows just how this was done.

Determining Vessel Function
Several independent criteria are used to determine vessel function: form, size,
context, use-wear, and ethnographic analogy. Function may not be suggested by any one
of these criteria, but together they can provide a convincing case for the function or
functions served by a specific class of pottery.
Form
Vessel form can be derived from sherds in collections from the site or area. Often,
sherds are large enough to reveal a profile of the form, and from that the overall vessel
can be reconstructed on paper (Figure 55). Rim sherds are the most informative, but we
use sherds from all parts of the vessel in an attempt to get it right. Determining vessel
form from sherds is important, because from this point on in the analysis, we will speak
of vessels. After all, people were using vessels before they became sherds. This did not
preclude them from using large sherds as tools or as shallow containers themselves, but
worked sherds is an altogether different topic.

59

Figure 55. Illustration showing how vessel form can be determined from a single rim sherd (from
Olin and Dillon 1992: Figure 7.4)

We never anticipate a single function use for any vessel simply because that is not
the way people generally use tools, and pottery was a tool. A vessel is made in a specific
shape in anticipation of its intended function (Figure 56), such as a cooking pot. But the
cooking pot (assumed on the basis of form) may also be used to dip water out of a
container, temporarily store dry foods, to cover something, as a pit liner, or placed in a
grave with a food offering. Some of these alternative functions can be determined by the
context in which the vessel was recovered (a burial for example), but we will never know
the full range of functions for which a particular vessel was used.

Figure 56. Some vessel forms.

Form is, however, the first clue of intended function. Certain jars are specifically
designed for cooking while others were designed for storage of liquids. Bowls and plates

60
were for serving, and mugs, pitchers, and bottles for serving liquids. Ceramic cooking
pots constitute one of the most basic vessel forms used around the world, even today.
These vessels are designed to make efficient use of heat, have rounded contours and thin
walls for heat absorption, large orifices for easy access but constricted necks to prevent
boiling over, and coarse paste to withstand thermal shock. Figure 57 shows ancient forms
of cooking pots from around the world.

Figure 57. Ancient cooking pots (after Rice 1987: Figure 7.14).

Size
Vessel size also may relate to function. Jars come in all sizes, but cooking jars
may fit a certain size range while storage jars may fit another. Measurements on vessel
size can be obtained simply by measuring the diameter of a rim sherd or large sherd from
the widest point on the body. All that is required is a graduated series of arcs at one
centimeter increments. Invert the sherd and place the rim on the scale flush with the table
so that no light can be seen beneath the sherd. Move the sherd along the scale until the
closest match with an arc is reached. Read the arc diameter (Figure 58).

61

Figure 58. Technique for measuring rim diameter (from Orton, Tyers, and Vince, 1993: Figure
13.2. Photo by Treavor Hurst).

Context
Context refers to where a pot was found, or the matrix in which it was found,
including associated items and provenience. A vessel’s context may provide unequivocal
evidence of how the vessel was used, or maybe not. Pots are tools and can be used in a
variety of tasks other than that which they were originally intended. It all depends on the
context and comparisons with the context of similar vessels. Large jars placed in storage
areas, for example, were likely used for storage. Vessels recovered from the floor of a
room may have been part of a household assemblage, but this context does not
necessarily reveal how the vessels were used. Soot coated jars found next to hearths were
likely used for cooking. Vessels containing stored dry foods, or those inverted over jars
and used as lids had unequivocal functional roles. Bowls used for serving foods may be
left on a house floor, used as a lid, or as a baffle at the foot of a metate to catch the meal.
Vessels placed in mortuary context, however, do not reveal the intended uses of the
vessels, but they do show how the vessels were last used. Figure 59 shows a hypothetical
example of where pottery may have been used within a house.

Use-wear
Form, size, and embellishments provide general clues as to how a vessel may
have been used. Use-wear may provide a clue or direct evidence of use such as scratches,
cut-marks, abrasive wear, or stains. Sherds from cooking jars often display traces of soot
on the exterior surface. This is due to organic rich liquids leaking through the terra cotta
paste and burning out in the open fire. Soot is pure carbon and is a stable substance. It
therefore, preserves well and is datable by radiocarbon dating methods. Sherds or vessels
with traces of soot provide tell-tale evidence that the vessel was used in cooking.
A more direct source for functional evidence is analysis of lipids preserved in the
pottery body. Vessels used to cook stews and gruels containing lipids (digestible fatty
acids that occur in all plant and animal tissue) may hold traces of organic residue. Liquid
organics containing lipids soak into the fabric of the pottery. Residue analysis using gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry identifies the lipids that belong to broad food classes.
Sometimes more species specific classes can be identified. The goal of residue analysis is
to determine what was cooked or processed in the vessel. It helps to know the kinds of

63
plants available to the culture that used the pottery. These kinds of tests, however, are
expensive and usually beyond the resources of avocational societies and most archeology
programs.
Bowls used around the house for serving and other related functions show
abrasive wear on the bases. Rims are often nicked and the interior scratched. Such wear
traces also often leave scratches and abrasions from instruments used to scrape the food
or clean the vessel (Figure 60). Wear in the interior of the bowl shown in Figure 61 was
so severe that it not only obliterated the design, but also wore away the white slip
underneath.

Ethnographic and Historic Analogies
Ethnographies and historical descriptions around the world are replete with
examples of indigenous and non-industrial peoples making and using pottery (Figures 5,
62, and 63). Studies of pottery among indigenous people provide insight that help
archeologists frame their research and understand the processes of pottery manufacture
and use. While those ethnographies and historic analogies are useful, ultimately, the
archeologist will have to place his or her findings within the context of the culture that
produced the pottery sample undergoing analysis.

Figure 63. Hopi family eating from a common bowl. Such images show that decorated bowls
were used as serving vessels (photo courtesy of Smithsonian Institution).

66
Vessel Assemblage Composition
Rim sherds also can be used to determine the vessel assemblage, that is, the ratio
of vessel forms represented in the sample. Since vessel assemblages are deduced from
sherds, they represent the breakage rate for each kind of vessel in use at any one time
(Figure 64). For example, the ratio of rim sherds of bowls to jars and bottles can occur in
the sherd assemblage from a midden in a ratio of 3:1:1. A household assemblage
constructed from a dwelling floor had a ratio of 1:3:3. The differences may reflect the
breakage/replacement rate for each vessel form. In other words, bowls which are handled
daily were broken six times as often as were jars and bottles. I would expect stylistic
change to occur far more rapidly in bowls than in either other the other vessel categories
because of a more frequent replacement rate. These kinds of numbers can be used in
comparing ceramic assemblages between sites (such as a hamlet vs. a ceremonial site), or
between households within a site. Also, analysis of this sort is especially useful when
comparing households of different social ranking (such as a plantation house and a
sharecropper’s house).
Vessel assemblage differs from a household assemblage. A household
assemblage consists of the numbers and kinds of vessels used within a household.
Household assemblages are usually determined by the number of whole vessels left in a
house when it was abandoned. Such household assemblages are rare in Texas, but are not
uncommon in the American Southwest or in Mesoamerica. A very rare glimpse of
household assemblages was provided by volcanic eruptions that buried Maya hamlets in a
Pompeii-like event at the site of Ceren, in El Salvador.

Summary
The guidelines for studying a collection of pottery were presented in this part of
the workbook. Pottery analysis begins with a collection of sherds. The first step in
ceramic analysis is to sort and classify the sherds into descriptive groups or types,
varieties, styles, or wares using clusters of attributes. Attributes include paste categories,
decorative modes, and vessel parts (rims, body, and base). The analyst has the option of
using one of several typological schemes depending on the kind of information desired.
Types may be descriptive, technological, morphological, or functional. Varieties may be
distinguished among items in any single type.
Once order has been placed on the sample, several studies are possible. Two
possible studies were discussed, chronology and function. Chronological studies focused
on defining changes in types and styles through time. Functional assessments about how
a particular vessel class may have been used are based on form, context, use-wear, and
ethnographies and historical analogies. The next section will take pottery analysis to the

68
next level of interpretation and show how pottery can reveal much about the people and
their culture.

PART V
Potsherds to People
Pottery can reveal much about the people who made and used it. Indeed,
archeologists have identified certain cultures by their distinctive pottery. Pottery was
made to be used for cooking, storage, and serving. Each of these basic functions occurs in
a variety of contexts and requires different attributes within each functional category.
Pottery is used to identify or determine:
 Geography and Cultural identity
 Chronology and Cross-dating
 Subsistence
 Duration of Site Occupation
 Technology and Production
 Trade and Exchange
 Style and Tradition
 Style and Messages
 Ideology and symbolism
Geography and Cultural Identity
The geographic distribution of sites with specific kinds of pottery is often used as
a means of establishing prehistoric cultural boundaries and establishing the “home range”
for an archeological culture. The archeological culture is defined by the geographic
patterning in material culture. It may or may not correlate with that of a specific ethnic or
language group since two or more ethnic groups may share virtually identical material
culture patterns. The geographic distribution of Caddo pottery is used to identify the
ancestral homeland of the Caddo people (see www.texasbeyondhistory.net). Another
example is the distribution of Mimbres Style III pottery produced from ca. A. D. 10101140. Production areas for the pottery shown by the stippled area in Figure 65 were
determined by neutron activation analysis (NAA) of potsherds (see below) and identifies
the Mimbres villages where the pottery was produced and where the people lived. The

70
geographic distribution of the pottery, shown by the hatched area in Figure 65 maps the
extent of trade and exchange.

Figure 65. Heartland of the Mimbres culture is shown in the stippled area defined by the known
production site for the pottery. The distribution of Mimbres Style III pottery beyond the
production sites, shown in the hatched area, is attributed to trade and exchange.

Ceramic Chronology and Cross-Dating
Establishing dates for ceramics is very important since potsherds endure and are
excellent chronological indicators as was shown in Part IV. Chronologies provide a
relative ordering of types and styles by establishing that Type A is older or younger than
Type B through ceramic seriation as shown in Part IV. Tree-ring, radiocarbon, or other
dating methods established that Type A occurs from about A.D. 1050 to 1100. By
knowing when Type A was made, an archeologist can use the sherds of that type as a tool
for cross dating. When Type A is found in an otherwise undated deposit, the archeologist
knows the period of occupation covers at least the time span of the sherd. An example of
a well-dated stylistic series is shown in Figure 45. A similar, albeit more complex, model
can be produced using Woodland and Caddoan pottery from east Texas. One can get
more information on the pottery chronology in east Texas by visiting the Texas Beyond

71
History web site Tejas: Life and Times of the Caddo
(http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/tejas/).
Using historic ceramics for cross-dating is often more precise since the production
periods for certain wares are well documented. Production periods for majolica, faience,
creamware, pearlware, or mocha are well known and are immediate keys to identifying
the chronological age of a historic site. Some historic wares are stamped with makersmarks or signatures that were registered, and often serve as excellent temporal markers
when found in archeological sites.
Subsistence
Pottery can tell us how vessels may have been used in food processing, storage,
cooking, and serving through functional analysis. Information about food reveals much
about a group’s culture and life way. In subsistence-oriented societies, like those of many
ancient Native Americans, it was all about food.
A myth often heard in the archeological community is that pottery was produced
by agriculturalists, and that hunters and gatherers did not use pottery. This is a myth since
exceptions to both statements can be shown in Texas alone. Agricultural people usually
do make and use pottery because dry foods need soaking and boiling before being
consumed. There is suspicion in the Southwest, for example, that pottery became a
necessity when beans were introduced into the diet. Beans require soaking before
cooking and consumption. The earliest pottery in the Southwest dates to about 200 B.C.,
about the same time that beans make their appearance. Corn was introduced from Mexico
much earlier, or about 1,500 B.C.
Pottery was not easily transported by hunters and gatherers who moved about the
landscape. Baskets and hide containers were much more serviceable and durable, and
they weighed less. With the exception of southeast Texas, hunters and gatherers during
the Archaic Period did not produce pottery. Pottery first appeared among coastal and
inland hunters and gatherers in southeast Texas about 200 BC. By the Late Prehistoric
period, however, hunters and gatherers across much of central and coastal plain regions
produced their own utilitarian pottery. In the Toyah culture of central Texas, these were
mostly small to medium size bowls and jars of Doss Redware, Leon Plain, and Booth

72
Brushed. Narrow-neck jars or ollas of Doss Red Ware and Rockport Black-on-gray were
also made in the central and coastal bend regions, respectively, again regions known to be
home to hunters and gatherers. Deep bowls and barrel-shaped jars were vessel forms of
the people around Galveston Bay. Assuming that the hunting and gathering groups in
question were not growing crops, how were they using the pottery? Narrow mouth jars
may have been canteens for long-distance travel by family groups. Deep bowls and jars
were likely used for cooking and to render fat from animal bone. Tallow was a very
important food product and source of needed animal fat. Archeologists have noted that
bone recovered from southeast Texas and Toyah phase sites were splintered into small
pieces, presumably for boiling to remove the fat. Lipid analysis eventually may resolve
these functional issues. Clay jars were placed in canoes by the Akokisa and used to ferry
hot coals from site to site in the Galveston Bay area.
Vessel forms and sizes are more varied among agricultural people where pottery
served multiple functions and was used in various contexts (see Figure 64). Cooking was
certainly a primary function, but clay jars also protected foods in storage, both above and
below ground. Liquids could be kept in jars in the household as well. Pottery was used by
all agricultural cultures in Texas. Most produced their own such as the Caddo and the
pueblo people at La Junta and in the El Paso region. Farmers in the Panhandle and north
central Texas produced some of their pottery but seem to have traded for some of it.
Duration of Site Occupation
Pots break, and the more a pot is handled or used, the more likely it will be
broken. Cooking pots received daily use as did serving bowls and were likely broken
with greater frequency. Water jars were storage containers and were not subjected to
frequent handling. These factors determine breakage and replacement rates. Middens or
trash heaps provide direct access to which vessels were broken more often. This can be
useful information when one wants to know how long a site was occupied.
Information on the number of vessels represented in the sherd sample is required.
Rim sherds are used to calculate the minimum number of individual vessels (MNI). All
that is necessary to calculate the MNI is to count all unique rim sherds. If two rim sherds
that do not fit have the same profile, thickness, and design, they possibly came from the

73
same vessel. In fact, they may be from two different vessels of the same style or type.
However, unless we have evidence that they are from two different vessels, we are
obligated to assume they are from the same vessel so we do not inadvertently overestimate our MNI counts. Two or more rim sherds likely from the same vessel would be
counted as one since they are not unique. MNI counts are important in estimating the
number of vessels broken at the site. For example, if 10 vessels are counted in a 10 X 10
meter excavation, and the site covers 10,000 square meters, then 1000 vessels may have
been broken during the period of occupation. These projected counts may provide
comparative information on the size of the occupying group and how long a site was
occupied. For example, let us assume that a family of five would break five pots a year. It
would take one family living at the site two hundred years, or five families twenty years,
or ten families ten years to break that many pots. Dating methods may provide dates
during the occupation as an independent test for the time estimates based on sherd
analysis. With that information an archeologist can estimate the population for a specific
site.
Technology and Production
An examination of pottery will show how it is made, whether by hand (coil and
scrape or paddle and anvil), wheel-made, or molded. Each of these basic methods of
producing pottery tells something about the level of sophistication and complexity of the
society that produced it. Hand-made pottery is customarily associated with subsistenceoriented cultures with little if any craft specialists. Wheel and mold made pottery, by
contrast, was mainly produced for market exchange and its production indicates a culture
with a complex economic and market system.
The level of production of ceramics usually parallels the levels of economic
complexity of a culture or society. It is not at all unusual to find pottery made by settled
agricultural people like the Caddo or Rio Grande pueblos a hundred miles or more from
its source.
In hunter-gatherer societies, the family is the primary economic unit. For
example, on a daily round, women may gather while men hunt and forage. Moving about
the territory was a necessity. Production and consumption occurred at the household

74
level, and any pottery made was used by the people who made it. Pottery made by
hunters and gatherers such as the Toyah culture in central Texas and hunters and
gatherers along the Texas coast bares little, if any, decoration (Figure 66). If a huntergatherer group did not make their own pottery, they obtained it through trade if and when
they desired such vessels..

Figure 66. Texas hunter-gatherer cooking pots. Doss Redware1
(left) and Goose Creek Plain2 (right).

Pottery production in settled villages such as the Caddo and Rio Grande pueblos
in the El Paso area occurred at the cottage-level and consumption occurred mainly within,
but also outside the extended families. Cottage-level production usually exceeded that
which was needed for household consumption. Because of the large social units and
frequent public events and feasts, pottery was used for things other than cooking. Pottery
among people who lived in settled villages was more elaborate since people outside the
family would be judging its aesthetic and functional qualities. These are among the
reasons that pottery made by the Caddo and pueblo people is more highly decorated than
that among hunters and gatherers. Also, the designs incorporated icons and may have
conveyed certain social, political, or religious messages. Pottery was exchanged between
families and villages, and trade occurred among villages and outsiders.
Craft specialization in a society that has a market economy becomes the domain
of the specialized craftsmen, such as potters, weavers, cobblers, metal-smiths, and so
forth. Production increased and products became standardized in form and size. Pottery
was mass produced for the consumer market among these societies, and not for
immediate family needs. Nonrtheless, it is in market economies that pottery is often made
by using the potter’s wheel and mold. Market economies occurred in most ancient
civilizations around the world, but New World Precolumbian civilizations (Mesoamerica,

75
South America) were exceptions. It was not until Late Postclassic times (A.D. 13501650) that true market economies developed in these areas.
How does this basic information on ceramic production translate to Texas?
Hunters and gatherers in central Texas and along the coast made pottery in Late
Prehistoric times. Doss Redware in central Texas, Goose Creek and Rockport wares
along the coast are examples (see Figure 66). Part-time Antelope Creek farmers in the
Panhandle made their own cooking ware (Borger Cordmarked). Plains Caddo and
Jicarilla Apache part-time farmers also made their own cooking ware, but traded pottery
with the eastern pueblos such as Taos and Pecos. Caddo farmers of east Texas and Pueblo
farmers in far west Texas produced their own cooking and decorated serving and storage
vessels. Unlike the previously mentioned groups, however, pottery was widely
exchanged among them and between their neighboring groups. Historically, mass
produced pottery (majolica, faience, green-glazed earthenware) used by Spanish and
French colonists was imported, first from Europe and later (for the Spanish) from
Mexico. These groups also made extensive use of indigenous pottery and recruited
natives to produce pottery since imported pottery was expensive and hard to replace.
Trade and Exchange
Not everyone produced pottery. Yet pottery was among the items commonly
exchanged among native people within a village, between villages, and in regional
trading fairs. When we find sherds of a pot at a site that does not mean the pot was made
at that site. Using a combination of methods, archeologists can often determine the area,
and perhaps even the site, where a vessel was manufactured. By tracing the pattern of
movement of pottery from a site, ancient exchange networks can be mapped out.
The generalizations presented earlier in this chapter are based on hard facts
gathered through ethnographic studies and sourcing pottery. Archeologists have several
methods of sourcing pottery, each with its own advantages. Two methods, petrographic
analysis and neutron activation analysis (NAA), are discussed here to illustrate how
sourcing is accomplished. These methods are costly because samples are sent to special
laboratories for analysis.

76
Petrographic Analysis
Petrographic analysis (or petrography) involves the identification of minerals
that appear in the clay bodies of the pots, usually as temper but sometimes simply as
natural inclusion in the clay. Temper often consists of sands and crushed rocks.
Identifying the kinds of minerals in the sands and crushed rock can provide information
on the geological location in which the vessel was made. If this geological location is
different from that where the vessel or sherd was found, then a sound argument can be
made that the vessel was traded or exchanged into the local area.
Petrographic analysis requires some destruction of the sherd. The sherd is cut with
a diamond saw and a very thin (0.03 mm) slice that is mounted on a slide. The slide is
then examined under polarized light to identify mineral crystals that might be present.
Thin sections can reveal minerals of the temper particles, and the relative percent of
temper compared to clay, and provide a percentage count of the various mineral types
present in the sherd. Rocks and sands used as temper usually have known geographic
distributions based on regional geology. Petrographic studies often include sand samples
obtained in the region of the archeological study to gain base-line information on locally
occurring minerals. The distribution of rock types are obtained from local geological
maps. Data from sherds are compared to the sand and rock data to define the mineral
region in which the ceramics were made. Petrography is limiting in that it can only
identify a mineral region and not the site or sites of production. Figure 67 shows a
microscopic thin section. Note the various temper particles embedded in the clay.

Figure 67. Microscopic thin section taken with polarized light to identify mineral constituents in
the sherd.

77
There are a number of laboratories that can make thin sections for various costs,
depending on what kind of slide or treatment one wants. These laboratories are usually
affiliated with academic departments of geosciences or commercial laboratories
(University of Oklahoma, Washington University, University of Arizona, University of
Wisconsin, Geo-Ark Petrographic Ltd in Saskatchewan, Canada, among many others).
Getting the thin-section cut and placed on a slide is the easy part. After this, a
mineralogist must examine the slide and identify the mineral crystals.
Neutron Activation Analysis
Neutron activation analysis examines the trace mineral elements in the clay used
to make a vessel. The clay can be sourced to the geological outcrop. This method is
destructive in that part of a sherd must be sacrificed. The fragment used is from the
interior of the sherd and is ground to obtain a clean sample. This sample is pulverized and
placed in a capsule which is then introduced into a nuclear reactor and bombarded with
electrons to radiate the sample. Many radiated elements decay quickly, and the sample is
subjected to two separate counts to obtain profiles of the trace elements present. Many of
these elements are present in infinitesimal amounts of parts per million. The element
“profiles” that are then created amount to fingerprints for the approximate clay source of
each sherd.
No two sherds will yield the exactly same fingerprint, even if they are taken from
the same vessel. The reason is that clays are often unevenly mixed. The analyst will
compare a cluster of elements identified in the sample of sherds tested. Sherds that fall
within the same cluster group are presumably from the same source. The results of a
cluster analysis from a large sample of sherds from the Mimbres Valley in New Mexico
are illustrated in Figure 68. The different clusters identify different clay groups, but do
not necessarily identify the site from which the sherds were made. Two or more sites may
share the same clay group either because they are using the same clay source or the
geological deposits are similar. Regardless, the archeologist can identify the specific area
or source for the sherd.
Neutron activation analysis labs are limited to those with nuclear reactors. The
Center for Chemical Characterization at Texas A&M University and the University of

78
Missouri Research Reactor Center (MURR) are the major labs currently doing NAA on
Texas ceramics. Both labs are compatible in that data run in one can be incorporated into
the data base of the other laboratory, although MURR analyzes several elements that
Texas A&M University does not. Prices vary according to funding source, and the labs
must be contacted directly to obtain a price quote. Expect to pay at least $50 per sample,
however.

Figure 68. Cluster analysis of Mimbres sherds from a neutron activation analysis completed at
Texas A&M University. The sherds are clustered into clay groups on the basis of similarities of
elements or element “fingerprints”.

The most desirable trace element results occur when both NAA and ceramic
petrography are done on the same sample. These two methods provide independent
means of tracing clays and temper. In a research project in the Hueco Basin in far west
Texas, both NAA and petrographic analysis were done for a group of sherds of El Paso
brownware. El Paso brownware is a technological style of pottery made over a long
period of time, comparable perhaps to Goose Creek Plain. Using NAA, we identified
three separate clusters indicating at least three clay sources were used in the manufacture
of the sherds. The petrographic analysis narrowed the scale by introducing at least two

79
separate temper groups, which overlapped the clay groups. The sherds clusted into at
least four separate groups based on clays and tempers within the brownware samples.
Style and Tradition
The style of an artifact may relate to other interconnected behaviors. The style of
a water jar, for example, may be partly determined by the traditional way women carry
the jar (Figure 69). In Native American and most other non-industrial cultures pottery
was made by women. They learned their craft from the parent generation who, in turn,
learned it from generations before them. Each cultural group had its own ceramic
tradition. The term tradition is used in archeology to define a cultural pattern that was
used over many generations. For ceramics, tradition refers primarily to technology,
distinctive vessel shapes, and modes of decoration. Archeologists speak of the sandy
paste tradition in southeast Texas, or the brownware tradition in far west Texas. In other
words, archeologists can literally draw a line around a prehistoric ceramic-producing
culture based on the distribution of the distinctive pottery. The influence that culture had
on its neighbors can be gauged, in part, by the distribution of that pottery outside the
heartland where it was produced (see Figure 63).

Figure 69. Different styles of water jars in different geographic regions of Highland Guatemala
related to different traditions of carrying the jars (from Rice 1987: Figure 15.4).

80

Style and Messages
Style conveys messages and styles evolve to fit the social occasion. Using
clothing as an example, we usually dress in accordance with the spheres of social contact
in which we expect to appear (Figure 70). We lounge around our homes and family often
wearing clothes of comfort such as sweats and house shoes. If we attend an informal
sporting event, we wear a different selection of clothing; the same would hold if we went
to a formal event such as the opening night at the opera. We do these things because they
are proper, are expected, and are respectful of the place or event. This model applies to
most any form of material culture, such as jewelry and pottery. This example can help to
understand why some pottery is highly decorated in a complex ceramic-producing culture
such as the Caddo, Mimbres, or Maya, and some is not.

Figure 70. Hypothetical social spheres within which society operates.

Pottery produced among hunter-gatherers is plain, simple, and consists mostly of
cooking pots and bowls (see Figure 66). These purely utilitarian vessels were likely used
to process foods and transport coals. Little, if any, embellishment occurs on these vessels
because they seldom leave the context of the household. If decorations occur, they are
primarily wet paste decorations that roughen the exterior surface and enhance the
functional qualities of the vessel. The same would hold true for pottery made to be used
within the household of more complex pottery-making societies, such as cooking pots
(Figure 71).

81
Vessels used in intra-village and inter-village gatherings, however, are predictably
embellished (see Figure 71). A water jar carried across the plaza will be seen by people
outside the family. In other cases, the sanctity of the occasion probably determined the
relative degree of elaboration. In agricultural societies where large gatherings of people
were possible when there were abundant food reserves, public ceremonies and feasts
occurred throughout the year. We know from ethnographic descriptions that these were
often elaborate social affairs and involved gift-giving and other methods of exchange.
Our own Thanksgiving is rooted in a Native American harvest ceremony. Ceramics were
often items presented as gifts or subjects of barter. The more elaborate the vessel, the
more prestige it brought the maker or trader. Predictably in agricultural societies capable
of producing food reserves such as the Caddo of east Texas and pueblo groups of the
Southwest, elaborately decorated ceramics will occur along with utilitarian vessels.

82

Many of us recognize this general model of pottery use in our everyday lives. At
home with the family most people use inexpensive pottery, melmac, or even paper plates.
When company visits, however, better dishes are usually chosen. Holiday feasts such as
Thanksgiving, Christmas, or Hanukkah, will be served on the finest dinner ware. Of
course this model is a generalization and does not represent hard and fast rules, and
exceptions can be found.
Ideology and Symbolism
Another role that pottery may serve is to convey religious or political messages by
displaying icons or images that are recognized among the broader social sphere such as
one might find in a gathering of people from related villages. These messages displayed
in design style or vessel form may signify clan membership, icons, religious symbols,
ancestor spirits, social roles, or even calendar ceremonies. Unless we are privy to the
information system producing the items, we cannot know the meanings. It is clear to most
what a fish emblem on the back of a car stands for, but what about a fish in a Mimbres
bowl? Possible messages may have been conveyed in the designs or shapes of the vessels
shown in Figures 72 and Figure 73.

Summary
Pottery is hand-made in non-industrial societies following time-proven methods
and techniques. Because pottery is made following traditional rules of form and design, it
can serve to identify an archeological culture and map its sphere of trade and exchange.
Even within a pottery tradition, however, changes do occur as the social and
technological needs of a culture change through time. Changes in ceramics through time
can be used to create ceramic chronologies because pottery is often the most sensitive
class of material culture in terms of style change available to the archeologist. Once a
chronology has been established and dated, ceramic types and styles themselves can be
used as cross-dating tools.
Pottery was a tool, and the attributes of form, size, decoration, and texture relate
to how the tool was used. Agricultural people had more uses for pottery than did hunters
and gatherers, but pottery among both groups provide some hint as to their subsistence
level and practices. Hunters and gatherers characteristically lived in small social groups
and were often highly mobile in their movements. Pottery was used by small family
groups for only a limited range of functions and was largely utilitarian. Agriculturalists
used pottery for utilitarian purposes such as cooking, storage, and serving, and in public
events where pottery was displayed and seen by both kinsmen and outsiders. As a general

84
rule, the larger and more varied the social aggregates using pottery, the fancier the wares.
In the latter cases, especially in public ceremonies and ritual occasions, pottery form and
design carried social, political, and iconic messages.

.
Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA) a method to identify trace-elements in clays by
bombarding a sample taken from a sherd with electrons using a
nuclear reactor. The radiated elements are identified as the
radioactive isotope decays. NAA is used to identify the clay source
and the site or area a vessel was made.

certain colors when the minerals (iron and manganese) become
oxidized. Oxidized clays often have a burnt sienna (reddish) hue.

Paddle and Anvil

a method of forming a pot by welding slabs of clay with the fingers
and evening the sides using a paddle and anvil. The paddle is
applied to the exterior and the anvil is held on the inside to support
the wall.

Paleolithic

refers to a broad period in Old World prehistory prior to the
introduction of agriculture, or before about 8,000 years ago. Also
referred to by the antiquated term “stone age.”

Paste

the elastic mixture of clay and temper.

Pearlware

a fine white earthenware first introduced by Josiah Wedgewood in
1779. Due to the addition of kaolin in the body and cobalt oxide in
the glaze, it is whiter than creamware.

Petrography

microscopic analysis of pottery thin sections using polarized light
to identify mineral crystals and the geological source of temper.
Petrographic analysis also can be used to calculate the ratio of
temper vs. clay in the fabric.

Pinch pots

a simple method of forming a vessel by creating a bowl-shape with
the fist and pinching the sides to form a bowl.

Pinging

foreign substances such as gypsum or limestone unintentionally
mixed into the clays that absorb moisture after firing and expand,
causing failures to occur, sometimes to the point of cracking the
pot. A pinging sound occurs when the fragment pops out. Pinging
can occur months or years after a pot is made.

Porcelain

temperature range of 1280 to 1400ºC. The almost complete
vitrification results in a translucent body that has a distinctive ring
when tapped.

Porosity

resistance to absorption of liquids; the lower the porosity, the less
likely a vessel will absorb liquids.

Potlids

spalls that pop out of the surface due to the expansion of moisture
in the ceramic body.

Potsherds

pieces of broken pottery (also potshards).

Potter’s wheel

a turntable used to create centrifugal force to facilitate forming a
vessel and achieving symmetry.

Punctating

a decorative technique consisting of repeatedly impressing an
instrument into wet paste and creating a pattern of punctuations.

Precolumbian

that period in New World prehistory prior to the arrival of the
Spanish.

Pyrotechnology

the technology of fire. Firing temperature can be increased by
adding oxygen.

Puki

a shallow bowl used to form the base of a vessel; the vessel may be
rotated using the puki during formation and decoration.

Reduction

specifically desired color effect for clays and minerals. Reduction

92

93
(or reduced) fired iron-rich clays come out black or dark gray, and
glazes often have vivid colors due to the mineral additives.
Rocker-stamped

(see Stamping)

Salt glaze

salt is introduced into the kiln when the temperature peaks; the
sodium serves as a flux to create a clear glaze.

Seriation

a dating method based on changes in popularity of style, types, or
assemblages through time. A style becomes popular and in time its
popularity fades and is replaced by another style. Archeologists use
several methods to order styles, types, and assemblages
chronologically.

Settled villages

sites that were permanently occupied for a period of time. In
Texas, settled villages occurred among the Caddo and Wichita
groups, the La Junta district, and in the El Paso phase.

Slip

a fugitive or foreign clay-based liquid applied to the dry surface to
create an even color. The slip may serve as a canvas onto which
additional colors are applied as paint.

Smudging

a technique in introducing a fugitive shiny black finish by
subjecting the pottery to a reduced atmosphere and smoke at or
near the temperature peak.

Spongeware

a method of applying paint to bisque fired stoneware by dipping a
sponge to the paint and applying the pattern to the pottery.

Stamping

a decorative technique in which an instrument is repeatedly
impressed or stamped into a wet fabric. The instrument may be
rocked back and forth (rocker-stamped).
