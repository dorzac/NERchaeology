ABSTRACT
Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) conducted an archaeological survey
of 84.65 miles of proposed and existing water line in western Leon County, Texas in
January of 2002 under the supervision of William E. Moore. In addition to the water
line, the sites for one booster plant and one elevated storage plant were investigated as
part of this study. This work was sponsored by the Concord Robbins Water Supply
Corporation of Concord, Texas. No prehistoric sites were found, and no historic sites
within the 15 foot right-of-way were identified. Although the route of the proposed water
line generally traversed slopes of hills and low-lying areas, 11 locations were selected
for shovel testing. As part of this study nine previously recorded prehistoric sites
(41LN179, 41LN183, 41LN389, 41LN392, 41LN393, 41LN395, 41LN396, 41LN397,
41LN398), seven previously recorded historic sites (41LN53, 41LN54, 41LN187,
41LN264, 41LN283, 41LN284, 41LN402), and one prehistoric/historic site (41LN386)
were assessed in terms of the potential impact of the water line on these sites. No
significant sites will be affected by the proposed water line.

INTRODUCTION
Concord Robbins Water Supply Corporation (WSC) plans to improve the
domestic water supply to rural Leon County, Texas by installing new pipe and meters at
various locations throughout the western portion of the county (Figure 1). In all, the
project area consists of 84.65 miles of state and county roads with a right-of-way of 15
feet in width (Figure 2). Some of the line will be placed next to existing water line.
Additionally an elevated storage plant will be located on Farm-to-Market Road 1147,
and a booster plant will be located approximately 800 feet south of United States
Highway 79 along County Road 348.
Pursuant to the policy of the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA), J. F.
Fontaine and Associates, Inc. will attempt to place all new water line on private land just
inside the fence line. On private land the depth of disturbance is estimated at 36
inches. Those segments of line on public land may be deeper, possibly 4-5 feet.
According to Concord Robbins, all areas identified as significant or potentially significant
will be avoided by placing the water line within the public right-of-way.
Leon County is an area that contains significant archaeological sites, both
prehistoric and historic. This area has been the subject of several major cultural
resources investigations such as the ongoing Jewett Mine project to the north and an
earlier investigation of a water line by Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA)
(Moore 1994). Realizing the potential for sites within the proposed water line route, the
Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division, requested the route be examined by
a professional archaeologist in a letter to J. F. Fontaine & Associates, Inc. dated
December 12, 2001. In order to satisfy this requirement, BVRA was retained to conduct
the cultural resources survey.
Eight topographic quadrangles provide coverage of the project area. They are
Donie (1965, photorevised 1982); Hilltop Lakes (1964, photorevised 1982); Jewett
(1965, photorevised 1982); Margie (1964, photorevised 1982); Marquez (1965,
photorevised 1982); Robbins (1965, photorevised 1982); Round Prairie (1966,
photorevised 1982); and Spring Seat (1964, photorevised 1982).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Three major archaeological projects have been conducted in Leon County. They
are the Upper Navasota Reservoir (now Lake Limestone) (Prewitt 1974; Prewitt and
Dibble 1974), Jewett Mine (Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc. 1980; Voellinger and
Freeman 1980; Freeman and Voellinger 1982; Fields 1988), and Millican Reservoir
(Kotter 1982).
Lake Limestone was examined by the Texas Archeological Survey in 1974 under
contract with the Brazos River Authority. Only areas of high site probability such as
floodplains and valley margins along the Navasota River and its major tributaries were
surveyed. Fifty-two prehistoric sites were recorded within the reservoir area. Of this
number, 37 were found to be situated on the crests or slopes of eroded valley margins.
At Lake Limestone, Prewitt and Grombacher (1974:7) found a scarcity of sites
along the major tributaries. They attribute this to the possibility that desirable or needed
resources were more readily available along the mainstem valley than along the
tributaries.
Following the Lake Limestone project, work at Jewett Mine commenced in 1980
and is still in progress. The majority of sites in the county are on Jewett Mine property,
and most of our current knowledge of the prehistoric and early historic sites of the area
has been obtained from these studies.
At Jewett Mine, Voellinger and Freeman (1980:4-15) observed that all but two of
the sites are located in transitional zones. They found that the physiographically
transitional zones of the major creeks of the Jewett Mine area continually provided the
most attractive qualities for prehistoric populations. At Jewett Mine the average
horizontal distance to water was 131 meters, and 73 percent of the prehistoric sites are
located at or within 100 meters of water.
A scarcity of sites in areas of shallow soils was noted at Jewett Mine. Soil
probes on the terraces and upland breaks along the lower expanses of Mine Creek, for
example, repeatedly indicated less than 20 cm of soils over a clay base. In these areas
sites were absent. Beginning with the first deep sand hill upstream, however, an
abundance of prehistoric sites was found (Freeman and Voellinger 1982:2-62). One
suggestion for the preference of deep sandy soils is the possibility that certain plants
that prefer these deep soils were desired and exploited by prehistoric populations.

4

Freeman and Voellinger (1982:2-63) suggest that sites located on higher
terraces and upland margins are smaller in areal extent and contain less material
cultural remains than those along the major creeks. The latter should represent
habitational sites with artifact assemblages reflecting the area's major occupations.
Features such as hearths, storage pits, and structural remains might be found in sites
along the major creeks while the smaller sites at higher elevations should contain
activity specific tool assemblages.They (Freeman and Voellinger 1982:2-64) comment
on the difficulty of assessing site depth and size in the project area. Most sites
contained a single flake in shovel tests. According to them, "the general lack of surface
evidence indicating the presence of cultural manifestations will require testing far
beyond the scope of an archaeological survey to adequately address real site
dimensions." The intensive shovel testing during this survey sometimes failed to
disclose a site's integrity. Many sites, for example, have no obvious stratigraphy
beyond the gradual change from humic sand to sand to clayey sand.
The Millican Reservoir survey included parts of Brazos, Grimes, Leon, Madison,
and Robertson counties and recorded 25 sites in Leon County. Of this number, three
sites 41LN179, 41LN183, and 41LN187 are in the current project area.
In 1994, BVRA conducted an archaeological survey of 112 miles of proposed
water line in west-central Leon County for the Concord Robbins WSC (Moore 1994).
Eighteen prehistoric and historic sites were recorded. Of this number, nine are in the
path of the current project area. Part of the area surveyed in 1994 overlaps with the
current survey. The interested reader is referred to the above-mentioned reports for
additional data regarding previous work in Leon County.

FIELD METHODS
This project was performed using the pedestrian survey method supported by
shovel testing and probing as well as surface inspection of all eroded and otherwise
exposed areas within the right-of-way. The 84.65 mile project area was examined with
sandy hills overlooking creeks receiving the most attention. Prior to entering the field,
the site records at TARL were checked for the presence of previously recorded
archaeological sites in the project area and vicinity. In addition, a thorough review of
the existing literature for Leon County was conducted. The Principal Investigator
completed these tasks.
All areas that appeared suitable for the presence of prehistoric sites were shovel
tested. Each test was recorded on a shovel test log (Appendix I) and discussed in the
project notes. The excavated matrix was screened using 1/4 inch hardware cloth. In
all, 36 shovel tests were excavated. The locations of all shovel tests are depicted on
the relevant topographic maps (Appendix II). No shovel testing was conducted outside
the 15 foot right-of-way. Shovel probes were dug with a shovel to help confirm the
presence of shallow soils in some areas in place of shovel tests. Probes were not
screened, numbered, or depicted on the field maps. Profiles were drawn of the shovel
tests, and these drawings along with other notes are housed at BVRA.
It is the intention of the Concord Robbins WSC to be able to place the water line
on private property. There are stretches of road that pass through disturbed areas,
such as along the railroad right-of-way and across uplands distant from creeks and
other streams. These areas were examined but in a more cursory manner. This was
accomplished by the traditional windshield survey or by walking along the right-of-way
with little, if any, shovel testing or probing.
During the field survey the Project Archaeologist and Principal Investigator relied
on topographic maps and engineering maps provided by the client. As each road or
section of road was driven, the relevant topographic map was consulted for the
presence of nearby streams. This was necessary since creeks were not always visible
from the road. In some cases, for example, streams paralleled the water line route on
the opposite side of the hill from the road. At the same time, the engineering maps
were used to make notations regarding what was seen at that area. Each area driven
was given a number that corresponds to field notes taken in a notebook. The
probability of an area for prehistoric sites was written in the notebook for future
reference. Comments such as "low-lying area" and "slope of hill" are the kinds of
observations that prompted the survey crew to avoid shovel testing certain areas.
Seventeen previously recorded sites were found to be close enough to the
project area to warrant some level of assessment (Table 1). The locations of these
sites are depicted on the relevant topographic maps (Appendix III).

Two prehistoric sites (41LN183 and 41LN187) were assessed in the field without
shovel testing. Using site maps and forms prepared by the original recorders, the three
areas in the right-of-way were walked by the survey crew who examined the disturbed
surface for displaced artifacts and excavated shovel probes. According to the site
forms, no cultural materials were found within 50 meters of the highway at either of
these sites. Therefore, shovel testing was not conducted.
At site 41LN392, previously recorded by BVRA, there is no room for avoidance
by placing the water line in the public right-of-way. This site was examined by
excavating six shovel tests on private land that yielded no artifacts.
The remainder of the prehistoric sites in the project area (41LN386, 41LN389,
41LN393, 41LN395, 41LN396, 41LN397, 41LN398) were previously recorded by BVRA
in 1994. Since these sites have been previously determined to be not significant
therefore no assessment was necessary. At sites 41LN386, 41LN395, 41LN396,
41LN397, and 41LN398 water line was laid following the 1994 survey by BVRA. The
original survey yielded low numbers of artifacts at these sites with no diagnostics or
features present. At sites 41LN396 - 41LN398, for example, three of nine shovel tests
in the area produced only seven flakes.
Not one of the seven historic sites will be affected by the water line right-of-way
as currently proposed. Therefore, no formal assessment was necessary. According to
Mr. Treadway (personal communication, January 17, 2002), no standing structures will
be disturbed by the water line. He also stated that any cemeteries in the project area
will be avoided by placing the new water line on the opposite side of the road. No
historic cemeteries within the right-of-way were observed by the field survey crew.
Discussions of the 17 previously recorded sites appear as Appendix IV to this report.

RESULTS
A check of the site files and topographic maps at TARL revealed the presence of
17 previously recorded sites in or near the project area (Table 1). Nine of these sites
were recorded in 1994 by BVRA in areas already surveyed. The TARL search revealed
the presence of numerous sites in the vicinity of certain sections of the project area
recorded by other contract firms.
This investigation covered 84.65 miles of right-of-way. No previously unrecorded
prehistoric sites and no historic sites were found within the 15 foot right-of-way. The
proposed water line as currently planned will not affect any significant sites in or near
the project area. It is concluded that, although significant sites exist in the area, there is
a valid reason for the lack of new sites in the project area. Generally, the route of the
water line crosses few major creeks. Much of the project area is on slopes of hills, in
low-lying areas, or flat stretches of land between streams. In some cases disturbance
was an issue. At one area, for example, a pipeline running to a well on private land was
being constructed which destroyed the right-of-way in that section of the project area.
Some hills which appeared to be likely locations on the topographic map contained a
hard clay at or very near the surface as evidenced by ground exposure and shovel
probes. Ground surface visibility was excellent throughout the project area in the form
of human disturbance and rodent burrows. Even though a careful inspection of these
disturbed areas was made the four person survey crew, no cultural materials were
observed. This adds support to the theory that sites were not present.
Two historic sites were specifically mentioned for examination by reviewer Ed
Baker of the Texas Historical Commission. These are an unnamed cemetery near the
town of Marquez and the Bowling School and Lodge. Both sites were examined by
BVRA in 1994, and it was concluded that they would not be affected by the water line.
The cemetery will be avoided by placing the line in the public right-of-way, and the line
near the school and lodge will be placed adjacent to existing line.

RECOMMENDATIONS

No new archaeological sites were found within the project area right-of-way, and
no significant previously recorded sites will be affected by the water line construction. It
is, therefore, recommended that the Concord Robbins WSC be allowed to proceed with
construction as planned. Should, however, cultural materials be encountered during
construction in areas not discussed in this report all work should stop until the situation
can be evaluated by the THC in consultation with BVRA and Concord Robbins WSC.

APPENDIX IV: PREVIOUSLY RECORDED SITES
41LN53
This is a historic log cabin complex located on the Donie quadrangle
(Appendix II). According to the site card this site consists of a dogtrot cabin
modified to be used as a barn, wooden cribs, and a hand-dug well. The cabin is
in very poor condition and is on the north side of the road. The water line is
planned for the south side where no structures are present. No site form was on
file at TARL.
41LN54
This is a historic log building complex located on the Jewett quadrangle
(Appendix II). According to the site card this site consists of a 19th-20th century
house site with associated outbuildings. The house is in very poor condition and
is clearly out of the right-of-way.
41LN179
This is a prehistoric site located on the Hilltop Lakes quadrangle
(Appendix II). According to the site form this site consists of three tertiary flakes,
a crude quartzite uniface, and several pieces of burned quartzite. No evidence of
this site was found by the survey crew. The site is considered not significant by
the site recorders.
41LN183
This is a prehistoric site located on the Hilltop Lakes quadrangle
(Appendix II). According to the site form this site consists of 1 distal tip of a
projectile point, 1 tertiary flake of petrified wood, 4 pieces of burned quartzite,
and 1 piece of burned sandstone. The site map shows that this site is 50 meters
from the road. This site is considered not significant by the site recorders.
41LN187
This is a cane press and brick oven located on the Hilltop Lakes
quadrangle (Appendix II). According to the site form this site consists of the
single historic implement and modern bricks. It is outside the right-of-way. The
site is considered not significant by the site recorders.

41LN264
This is a historic house site located on the Donie quadrangle (Appendix II).
According to the site form this site consists of a 19th-20th century residence on
the north side of Highway 7. No evidence of the site was found on the south side
of the highway where the water line is planned. The site is considered not
significant by the site recorders.
41LN283
This is a historic house site located on the Donie quadrangle (Appendix II).
According to the site form this site consists of a historic residence and cistern on
the north side of the road. The house has been razed and replaced by a mobile
home. This site is considered not significant by the site recorders.
41LN284
This is a historic house site located on the Donie quadrangle (Appendix II).
According to the site form this site consists of a collapsed residence on the north
side of the road. No evidence of the site was found on the south side of the road
where the water line is planned. The only obvious remains of this site is a partial
chimney.
41LN386
This multi-component site is on the Spring Seat quadrangle and is located
on both the north and south sides of State Highway 7 on the west bank of the
confluence of Boyd Branch and McDaniel Creek (Appendix II). It was discovered
on February 1, 1994 by BVRA.
Topographically, it is just off the crest of the hill at the 440 foot contour.
The prehistoric component consists of a small tertiary flake fragment of very finegrained gray chert found at 50 cm on the south side of the highway on private
land and a larger flake fragment found at 120 cm on the north side of the road,
also on private land. The public right-of-way was not tested, and no artifacts
were observed in exposed areas. Since no diagnostic artifacts or features were
found, the age and function of this site are not known. The size of this site has
not been determined.
The historic component was observed on the north side of the road on
private land and consists of sheet metal fragments, two cut nails, and small
pieces of brick, glass, leather, and shell. All were in the upper 30-40 cm. Based
on the presence of cut nails, the historic component can date from the 1850s to
the present. A collapsed structure was noted just to the north and an abandoned
structure is depicted on the topographic map in this area.

Following a visit to 41LN386 by geologist Saul Aronow, it was concluded
that the portion of the site on the south side of the highway on private land has
been disturbed by windthrows, an erosional gully, and road construction. That
part of the site within the public right-of-way was probed with a shovel and found
to contain disturbed soils, possibly due to road construction. The north side on
private land, however, appears to contain undisturbed deposits. Since the site
was tested to 128 cm without reaching bedrock clay, the possibility of deeply
buried deposits must be considered. That part of the site within the public rightof-way on the north side is very disturbed through road construction and a buried
telephone cable.
41LN389
This prehistoric site is on the Jewett quadrangle and is located on the
north side of Farm-to-Market Road 1469 and the west bank of Starrett Branch
(Appendix II). It was discovered on February 2, 1994 by BVRA.
It was discovered by the presence of flakes on the surface of a sandy hill
that had been quarried for sand. Both sides of the highway has been disturbed
by sand quarrying. This site is not significant.
41LN392
This prehistoric site is on the Margie quadrangle and is located on the
north side of state highway 7 and the west bank of Brushy Creek (Appendix II).
Actually, it is on a ridge that lays between the main channel of Brushy Creek and
one of its tributaries to the west. It was discovered on February 4, 1994 by
BVRA.
Topographically, it is on a sandy terrace at the 370 foot contour. The site
was discovered by the presence of a biface fragment of tan, fine-grained chert on
the surface. No shovel tests were dug in the area of the surface find, but testing
was conducted on the south side of the highway. Since no diagnostic artifacts or
features were found, the age and function of this site are not known. The size of
this site has not been determined.
Following a visit to 41LN392 by geologist Saul Aronow, it was concluded
that this site might contain undisturbed deposits within the private right-of-way on
the north side of the road. The public right-of-way on the north side, however,
has been disturbed through road construction and erosion, and the public and
private rights-of-way on the south side are likewise disturbed.

41LN393
This prehistoric site is on the Margie quadrangle and is located on the
north side of State Highway 7 and the east bank of a tributary of Brushy Creek
(Appendix II). It was discovered on February 4, 1994 by BVRA.
Topographically, it is on a low flat hilltop at the 390 foot contour. The site
was discovered by the surface find of a flake of fine-grained chert in the backdirt
of a telephone pole and a possible biface of silicified wood and a chert flake on
an eroded surface below the first find. No shovel tests were dug in the site area.
Since no diagnostic artifacts or features were found, the age and function of this
site are not known. The size of this site has not been determined.
Following a visit to 41LN393 by geologist Saul Aronow, it was concluded
that the entire site area appears to be disturbed through road construction and
erosion. Also, bedrock clay appears to be present at or near the surface.
41LN395
This prehistoric site is on the Margie quadrangle and is located on both
sides of county road 1147 and the east bank of a tributary of Vestal Branch. It
was discovered on February 16, 1994 by BVRA.
Topographically, it is on a sandy terrace at the 580 foot contour. The site
was discovered by the presence of a flake (not collected) on the surface within
the private right-of-way on the west side of the road. A shovel test was
excavated in this area to 50 cm and was sterile. It was terminated because we
were informed by a friend of the landowner (Ms Dubbe) that permission had not
been granted for us to dig on this side of the road on private land. A check of
road and public rights-of-way did not reveal additional evidence of a site. On
March 23, 1994, two shovel tests were dug on the east side of the road within the
private right-of-way and two flakes were found in one test at 30-50 cm. The other
test was sterile. The deepest test was dug to 70 cm without reaching clay. Since
no diagnostic artifacts or features were found, the age and function of this site
are not known. The size of this site has not been determined.
Following a visit to 41LN395 by geologist Saul Aronow, it was concluded
that this site might contain undisturbed deposits within the private right-of-way on
both sides of the road. The public rights-of-way, however, have been disturbed
through road construction and erosion. Permission must be obtained from the
landowner on the west side to continue testing in this area.

41LN396
This prehistoric site is on the Round Prairie quadrangle and is located on
the north side of county road 436 and the north bank of Mill Creek (Appendix II).
It was discovered on February 16, 1994 by BVRA.
Topographically, it is on a sandy ridge or slope above the active and
deeply incised floodplain of Mill Creek at the 370 foot contour. The site was
discovered by the presence of a flake in a shovel test at 50 cm in the public rightof-way. A second test was dug just across the fence on private land and
produced 4 flakes between 20-50 cm. No tests were dug on the south side of the
road. Since no diagnostic artifacts or features were found, the age and function
of this site are not known. The size of the site has not been determined. This
site is approximately 300 meters west of 41LN398 and on the same landform.
The two were assigned separate numbers because of their separation by a low
area or depression in the ridge. It is likely that the entire ridge in this area
contains evidence of prehistoric utilization.
Following a visit to 41LN396 by geologist Saul Aronow, it was concluded
that this site contains undisturbed deposits within the private right-of-way on the
north side of the road, perhaps to a depth of 112 cm (the depth of the discovery
shovel test), and parts of the public right-of-way on the north side of the road,
although some of this area is partially disturbed through road construction and
erosion. The private right-of-way on the south side is also disturbed through road
and house construction and possibly a buried telephone cable. It is believed that
intact deposits are not present in this area.
41LN397
This prehistoric site is on the Round Prairie quadrangle and is located on
the north side of county road 436 and the north bank of Mill Creek (Appendix II).
It was discovered on February 16, 1994 BVRA.
Topographically, it is on a sandy ridge or slope above the active and
deeply incised floodplain of Mill Creek at the 370 foot contour. The site was
discovered by the presence of a flake in a shovel test at 60 cm in the public rightof-way. One test was dug in the private right-of-way on the south side of the
road and was sterile and in disturbed soil. No tests were dug in the public rightof-way on the south side of the road. Since no diagnostic artifacts or features
were found, the age and function of this site are not known. The size of this site
has not been determined.
This site is approximately 100 meters east of 41LN398 and on the same
landform. The two were assigned separate numbers because of their separation
by a low area or depression in the ridge. It is likely that the entire ridge in this
area contains evidence of prehistoric utilization.

Following a visit to 41LN397 by geologist Saul Aronow, it was concluded
that this site might contain undisturbed deposits within the private right-of-way on
the north side of the road, perhaps to 75 cm (the depth of the shovel test). The
public right-of-way on the north side of the road has been partially disturbed
through road construction and erosion; however, intact deposits may be present.
The public right-of-way on the south side of the road has been disturbed by road
construction and possibly a buried telephone cable. The private right-of-way on
the south side is also disturbed through road and house construction and
possibly a buried telephone cable. The disturbance on private land on the south
side of the road was documented by shovel testing and discussions with the
landowner.
41LN398
This prehistoric site is on the Round Prairie quadrangle and is located on
the north side of county road 436 and the north bank of Mill Creek (Appendix II).
It was discovered on February 17, 1994 by BVRA.
Topographically, it is on a sandy ridge or slope above the active and
deeply incised floodplain of Mill Creek at the 370 foot contour. The site was
discovered by the presence of a flake in a shovel test at 60 cm in the private
right-of-way. No tests were dug in the public right-of-way on either side of the
road or in the private right-of-way on the south side of the road. Since no
diagnostic artifacts or features were found, the age and function of this site are
not known. The size of this site has not been determined.
This site is approximately 300 meters east of 41LN396, 100 meters west
of 41LN397, and on the same landform. The three sites were assigned separate
numbers because of their separation by a low area or depression in the ridge. It
is likely that the entire ridge in this area contains evidence of prehistoric
utilization.
Following a visit to 41LN398 by geologist Saul Aronow, it was concluded
that this site might contain undisturbed deposits within the private right-of-way on
the north side of the road, perhaps to 70 cm (the depth of the shovel test). The
public rights-of-way, however, have been disturbed through road construction.
The private right-of-way on the south side is also disturbed through road and
house construction.
41LN402
This historic site is on the Jewett quadrangle and is located on the east
bank of Starrett Branch and the south side of F.M. 1469 (Appendix II). It was
discovered on February 2, 1994 by BVRA.

Topographically, it is on a sandy ridge overlooking the floodplain of
Starrett Branch to the west at the 440 foot contour. The site consists of a
standing structure (house) that probably dates to the early 20th century and is
located just inside the fence on private land. It is in very poor condition and
appears to be in danger of collapsing in the near future. No shovel tests were
dug in the site area. This site is not eligible for nomination to the National
Register of Historic Places as it is not believed to be pre-modern in age
(predating the 1920s-1930s), lacks architectural merit, and is in poor condition
(not intact). It is on the opposite side of the road where the water line is planned.
