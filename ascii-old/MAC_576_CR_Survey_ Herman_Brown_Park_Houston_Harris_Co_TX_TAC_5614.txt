ABSTRACT
On May 11-12, 2010, Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc., conducted a cultural resource
survey investigation of an approximately 88 acre tract within Herman Brown Park in eastern
Harris County, Texas. The objectives of the investigation were to locate and identify cultural
materials, sites, or historic properties within the proposed impact area, and to prepare
management recommendations regarding any identified resources. The investigations (MAC PN
09-55) were conducted for White Oak Studio Landscape Architecture, at the request of the
Houston Parks and Recreation Department, under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 5614. An
intensive pedestrian field survey of the project area was conducted, and included both surface and
subsurface (shovel test) examination. A total of 30 shovel tests were excavated. The shovel tests
identified the presence of shallow clays overlain in some areas by thin layers of artificial fill and
disturbed soils. No evidence of archeological or historic remains or features was identified in any
of the shovel tests. In the event that archeological deposits or features should be encountered
during construction, work should cease in the immediate vicinity and the Archeology Division of
the Texas Historical Commission contacted for further consultation.

INTRODUCTION
located on the Jacinto City 7.5â topographic
quadrangle. The project area consists of an
88 acre area within the park where a number
of improvements are planned.
These
improvements include roadways and parking
lots, a network of trails, and the
refurbishment of several extant facilities,
including soccer fields, basketball courts,
and tennis courts. However, the easternmost
33 acre portion of the current project area
was included in a previous pedestrian
archeological survey (Moore 1989), and as a
result, the proposed survey focused most
intensely on the 55 unsurveyed acres.

On May 11-12, 2010, Moore
Archeological Consulting, Inc., conducted a
cultural resource survey investigation of an
approximately 88 acre tract within Herman
Brown Park in eastern Harris County, Texas.
The objectives of the investigation were to
locate and identify cultural materials, sites,
or historic properties within the proposed
impact area, and to prepare management
recommendations regarding any identified
resources. The investigations (MAC PN 09Â­
55) were conducted for White Oak Studio
Landscape Architecture, at the request of the
Houston Parks and Recreation Department,
under Texas Antiquities Permit Number
5614.

An intensive pedestrian field survey
of the project area was conducted, and
included both surface and subsurface
(shovel test) examination (Figure 3; see
Appendix 1 for details). A total of 30 shovel
tests were excavated. The investigations
were conducted by project field archeologist
Randy Ferguson and field technician
Rachael Goings. David Driver served as the
projectâs principal investigator.

The proposed project consists of
various infrastructure improvements within
the western sector of Herman Brown Park in
Houston, Harris County. An archeological
survey proposal for the project has been
requested by the Archeology Division of the
Texas Historical Commission in its review
of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department
grant award for the project. The project is

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
Annual precipitation averages 46 inches
(117 cm).

Soils and Geology
Harris County is located within the
West Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic
province (Hunt 1974). In the Texas region,
the surface topography of the plain is
characterized by relatively flat topography
that dips slightly towards the Gulf of
Mexico. Geologically, the project area lies
atop the Beaumont Formation, a surface
outcrop that extends from just east of the
Mississippi River in Louisiana, to
Kingsville, Texas (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1982).
The formation was
deposited during a series of glacial and
interglacial events during the Middle to Late
Pleistocene. Extensive riverine downcutting
and erosion of the formation occurred during
the periods of lower sea levels associated
with the Wisconsin glaciation. During the
Holocene, after sea levels rose once more,
the resulting river valleys filled with alluvial
soils, creating broad, level floodplains.

Hydrology
The project area is located
approximately 400 m west of Hunting
Bayou, a perennial stream that flows into
Buffalo Bayou.
Flora and Fauna
Harris county lies within the
Austroriparian biotic province (Blair
1950:98-101). Not determined by a marked
physiographic break, the western boundary
of this province is loosely identified by the
distribution of pine and hardwood forests on
the eastern Gulf coastal plain. The county is
situated within the pine-oak subdivision of
the Austroriparian province (Tharp 1939).
Blair (1950) lists the dominant floral species
of the pine-oak forest subdivision as loblolly
pine (Pinus taeda), yellow pine (Pinus
echinata), red oak (Quercus rubra), post oak
(Quercus stellata), and blackjack oak
(Quercus marilandica). Hardwood forests
are found on lowlands within the
Austroriparian and are characterized by such
trees
as
sweetgum
(Liquidambar
styraciflua),
magnolia
(Magnolia
grandiflora), tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica), water
oak (Quercus nigra), and other species of
oaks, elms, and ashes, as well as the highly
diagnostic Spanish moss (Tillandisia
usneiodes) and palmetto (Sabal glabra).

The property is depicted on sheet 94
of the Soil Survey of Harris County, Texas
(Wheeler 1976). Three types of soil are
identified in the project area, Bernard clay
loam (Bd), Lake Charles clay, 0 to 1 percent
slopes (LcA), and Vamont clay, 0 to 1
percent slopes (VaA). All three soils types
are described as somewhat poorly drained.
Classifications of surface runoff vary from
very slow for Bernard and Lake Charles
soils, to slow to rapid for Vamont soils
(Wheeler 1976). Based on the PALM
predictive model developed by Abbott
(2001), all three soils represent upland
ancient (pre-Holocene) alluvia with a low
potential for containing deeply buried
prehistoric sites.

Blair (1950) and Gadus and Howard
(1990) identify the following mammals as
common within the Austroriparian province:
white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus),
muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), raccoon
(Procyon lotor), coyote (Canis latrans),
opossum (Didelphis virginiana), Scalopus
aquaticus, Pipistrellus subflavus, Lasiurus
borealis,
Sciurus
niger,
Sciurus
carolinensis, Glaucomys volans, Geomys
breviceps,
Reithrodonomys
fulvescens,
Peromyscus leucopus, Oryzomys palustris,
cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), packrat
(Neotoma floridana), eastern cottontail

Climate
The modern climate of the Harris
County study area is moderated by winds
from the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in mild
winters and relatively cool summer nights
(Wheeler
1976:2,
66).
Summer
temperatures average 92Â°F (33Â°C), while
winter temperatures average 64Â°F (18Â°C).

(Chrysemys concinna) and diamondback
terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin) comprise
common water turtles. Common lizards
include Anolis carolinensis, Sceloporus
undulatus, Leiolopisma laterale, Eumeces
laticeps, Cnemidophorus sexlineatus and
Ophiosaurus ventralis.
Snakes and
amphibians are also present in considerable
numbers and diversity.

(Sylvilagus floridanus), and swamp rabbit
(Sylvilagus aquaticus). Bison (Bison bison)
may have been present on nearby grasslands
at various times in the past (Gadus and
Howard 1990:15). Common land turtles
include eastern box turtle (Terrapene
carolina) and Terrapene ornata, while

turtle (Kinosteron spp.), river cooter

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
with a highly nomadic hunting tradition
brought with them from the Old World.
Traditional models emphasize the heavy
reliance that these groups placed on the
hunting of the large mammals of the
Pleistocene. Plant foods and small game
undoubtedly supplanted this diet, and may
have played a more important role than
previously thought (Black and McGraw
1985; Patterson 1995).
Artifact types
associated with this phase include various
fluted and non-fluted lanceolate projectile
points, such as Clovis and Folsom. In
general, due to a paucity of well-stratified
older sites, the Paleoindian stage remains
poorly defined in southeast Texas.

Southeast Texas Culture History
The project area is located within
the southeast Texas archaeological region
(Patterson 1995; Story et al. 1990). The
culture history of the region extends back at
least 12,000 years into the past. A number
of researchers have compiled chronological
frameworks to describe the cultural histories
of the area (Aten 1983; Ensor 1991;
Patterson 1995; Shafer et al. 1975; Story et
al. 1990). The majority of these divide
human occupation into four broad stages,
Paleoindian, Archaic/Lithic, Ceramic/Late
Prehistoric, and Historic. The stages are
based on a proposed sequence of economic
strategies as they are revealed through the
archaeological and/or historical record.
These proposed shifts in dominant lifeways
consider
cultural,
economic,
and
technological factors in order to provide a
heuristic model useful for attempting to
understand ancient and early historic
populations. While the dates assigned to the
period interfaces are based on "absolute"
dating methods, they of course represent a
generalized time range for the implied
cultural evolution. The dates provided in the
following discussion will be drawn from
Ensor (1991) and are presented in Table 1.

By 8000 B.C., the Late Wisconsin
glaciation had ended, increasing climatic
aridity and creating extensive changes in the
environment. As a result, the majority of
Pleistocene megafauna became extinct. This
required drastic changes in the dominant
subsistence strategies of the affected
populations. By 8000 B.C., the start of the
Early Archaic stage, the remaining southeast
Texas populations had adapted to the
environmental changes by shifting to a
lifeway dominated by seasonal scheduling.
This type of subsistence economy
specializes in a regionally circumscribed and
repetitive exploitation of specific floral and
faunal resources. By remaining in familiar
territory, the nomadic populations were able
to better exploit the various resources
available within their local environment.

The earliest period of occupation in
southeast Texas is identified as the
Paleoindian stage. Based on the earliest
securely dated appearance of populations in
the New World, this stage begins around
11,000-10,000 B.C., and lasts for
approximately 4000 years. During this time,
it is proposed that populations continued

6

to have led to increasing populations. This
rise in regional population may have been
further facilitated by the development of
long-distance
trade,
technological
innovations, and changing social relations
(Patterson 1995).

However, research has suggested
that human population densities remained
low in the area, and may have even
decreased significantly during this time
(Moore and Moore 1991). Eventually, the
stabilization of the climate by around 1000
B.C., the start of the Late Archaic, appears

The final prehistoric period in
southeast Texas is marked by the emergence
of ceramics. Ceramic artifacts appear in the
archaeological record of the Galveston Bay
area by approximately A.D. 100, and by
A.D 500, had been adopted by a number of
inland populations (Pertulla et al. 1995). A
plain, sand-tempered type of ceramic
identified as Goose Creek became prevalent
during the period, although a number of
decorated varieties and tempering materials
were also present (Patterson 1995; Pertulla
et al. 1995). The appearance of Caddoan
pottery in southeast Texas around A.D.
1000-1300 has been used to suggest the
presence of extended trade networks or
migration during this time (Aten 1983). The
period has also been associated with the
introduction of the bow and arrow around
A.D. 600 (Aten 1983).

Historic Overview
European contact in the region
began in the early 16th century with the illfated NarvÃ¡ez expedition that, in 1528,
deposited Cabeza de Vaca onto the Texas
coastline, possibly on Galveston Island.
More long-term contacts resulting from
permanent European settlement did not
directly impact aboriginal lifeways in
southeast Texas until the early 18th century
(Patterson 1995).
However, European
diseases introduced by explorers and early
traders had begun to affect Native American
populations in Texas by the 16th century
(Ewers 1974). Throughout the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries, epidemic diseases,
the mission system, and the fur trade
seriously reduced, and in some cases
exterminated, the indigenous populations
residing in the region.

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
historic that was located by Moore
Archeological Consulting, Inc., in 1997 as
part of a survey for a bikeway through
Herman Brown Park (Moore 1989). Though
the site was determined to have low
potential for further investigations, the bike
trail avoided the site.

Prior
to
beginning
field
investigations,
Moore
Archeological
Consulting, Inc., performed a background
investigation of archeological and historical
literature relevant to the project area.
Literature examined for this project includes
site inventory records on file at TARL,
previous archeological investigative reports
on file at the Texas Historical Commission
(THC)
and
Moore
Archeological
Consulting, Inc. and other published
literature pertinent to the current project.
The archival background search determined
that two previously recorded archeological
sites, 41HR622 and 41HR804, are located
approximately 400 m to the east of the
current project.
41HR622 is a multiÂ­
component Late Prehistoric occupation/19th
century historic sawmill site that was
investigated by Moore Archeological
Consulting, Inc., in 1989 as part of a partial
survey of Herman Brown Park (Moore
1989). The site was recommended for
further investigations. 41HR804 is a recent

Limited archeological work has
occurred in other areas along Hunting
Bayou. The earliest investigations occurred
near the streamâs confluence with Buffalo
Bayou. Several prehistoric sites, 41HR61Â­
70 (the Galena sites) were investigated by
Raymond Ring (TARL files). The sites
included occupation areas and shell
middens.
A survey for a 75 acre detention
basin
was
conducted
by
Moore
Archeological Consulting, Inc., in 2005
(Mangum and Moore 2005). No cultural
resources were identified in that survey.

FIELD METHODS AND RESULTS
The fieldwork was conducted on
May 11-12, 2010, and consisted of a 100%
pedestrian survey that included systematic
shovel testing and visual examination for
surface exposure of cultural materials.

33 acre portion of the current project area
was included in a previous pedestrian
archeological survey (Moore 1989), and as a
result, the proposed survey focused most
intensely on the 55 unsurveyed acres.

The proposed project consists of
various infrastructure improvements within
the western sector of Herman Brown Park in
Houston, Harris County. An archeological
survey proposal for the project has been
requested by the Archeology Division of the
Texas Historical Commission in its review
of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department
grant award for the project. The project is
located on the Jacinto City 7.5â topographic

A total of 30 shovel tests (STs 1-15)
were excavated, each in 10 cm levels and
screened through Â¼â mesh (Figure 3;
Appendix 1). Each of the projectâs shovel
tests were recorded and plotted on the
project map. The shovel tests identified the
presence of shallow clays overlain in some
areas by thin layers of artificial fill or
disturbed soils. All but one of the shovel
tests, ST 29, were able to reach what
appeared to be ancient (pre-Holocene)
subsoils.
No prehistoric or historic cultural
materials or features were found in any of
the shovel tests.
