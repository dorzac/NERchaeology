ABSTRACT
Gulf South Research Corporation (GSRC) conducted a cultural resources survey of a proposed
fence, patrol road, and lighting construction area for the Office of Border Patrol in Eagle Pass,
Maverick County, Texas on March 13 and 14, 2006. GSRC was contracted by the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District, under Contract Number W9126G-05-D-0021. The work
described herein was conducted under Texas Antiquities Code Permit No. 3932. The cultural
resources survey consisted of a pedestrian survey of the entire 63 hectare (155 acre) project
area and the excavation of three backhoe trenches (BHT) in the area north of the Eagle Pass
International Bridge I. The backhoe trenching was determined to be necessary because of the
depths of the alluvial soil deposits encountered during previous surveys near, or adjacent to, the
project area. The Right-of-Way for the fence and lighting consisted of a 0.6-meter (m) (2 foot
[ft]) wide by 520-m (1700 ft) long area. The three trenches in the project area were excavated
to a depth of approximately 2 m (6 ft) and the excavated soil was screened for cultural material.
There are two modern standing structures located slightly to the east of the trench excavation
area that are less than 50 years in age.
A limestone footing from a large residence built in the middle of the 19th Century was revealed
during the excavation of one of the trenches (BHT-3).

This site has been assigned Trinomial

number, 41MV308. The National Register of Historic Places eligibility of 41MV308 could not be
determined from the current investigations. Given the depth of the foundation and the narrow
width of the proposed fence corridor, it is not anticipated the site would be impacted by the
proposed construction. To ensure no adverse impacts would occur, archaeological monitoring
is recommended during the construction of the light poles and the main posts of the fence near
41MV308. No other cultural resources were located during this survey.

INTRODUCTION

The Office of Border Patrol (OBP) proposes to install a fence and lights, as well as to improve a
patrol road along the eastern river bank of the Rio Grande, west of downtown Eagle Pass,
Maverick County, Texas.

On March 13 and 14, 2006, Gulf South Research Corporation

(GSRC) and Prewitt and Associates, Inc. (PAI) conducted a cultural resources survey of the
project area. The investigation consisted of a pedestrian survey over the entire project area and
the excavation of three backhoe trenches (BHT) adjacent to the athletic field north of the Eagle
Pass International Bridge I (Figure 1-1 through Figure 1-3).
Prior to the initiation of this project, GSRCâs archaeologists conducted a file search through the
Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory (TARL) and the Texas Historical Commission (THC)
to determine if any historic properties were located within 1.6 kilometers (km) (1.0 mile [mi]) of
the proposed projectâs Area of Potential Effect (APE). GSRC also completed a search for
previous archaeological surveys and located the records of previously surveyed archaeological
sites that might be listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). During the search
through TARL, it was learned that some of the previous surveys conducted nearby (Brown and
Anthony 1998; Collins 1991; and Davis and Jones 1993) required backhoe trenching because of
the depth of the alluvial soils in this area (>6 meters [m]) (20 feet [ft]). Due to these expected
soil depths, shovel testing was determined to be impractical.

After consultation with the THC,

the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Fort Worth District, and a number of
geomorphology contractors, it was decided that the excavation of backhoe trenches would yield
the most useful information on the presence of cultural materials.

The pedestrian survey was performed by Carl Welch, GSRC project archaeologist, and
covered the entire project area from slightly south of the Camino Real International Bridge II to
the junction of Ryan St. with the Rio Grande on the north. The ground surface visibility was
almost 100 percent. The geomorphology work was subcontracted to PAI by GSRC, the prime
for the contract issued by the USACE, Fort Worth District. The northernmost and southernmost
trenches were excavated in an âLâ pattern and were approximately 10 m (33 ft) long on each
segment. The trench in the middle was a straight line excavation 15 m (50 ft) long (Figure 1-4).
All three trenches were excavated to a depth of approximately 2 m (6 ft) and were 0.6 m (2.0 ft)
wide.

Mr. Karl Kibler, a geomorphologist/archaeologist with PAI, did the analysis of the

stratigraphy encountered in the three trenches. The PAI report is included as Appendix A.

GENERAL SETTING OF THE PROJECT AREA

2.0

GENERAL SETTING OF THE PROJECT AREA

The project area is located in Eagle Pass, Maverick County, Texas (see Figures 1-1 through 13). The U.S./Mexico border and the Rio Grande are located directly west of the project area.
The project area is on a relatively flat section of land on the floodplain of the Rio Grande,
between downtown Eagle Pass and the Rio Grande.

Due to historic flooding in the project

area, there are a limited number of standing structures. The majority of the project area is used
primarily as an athletic field for soccer, baseball, and other outdoor activities. There is a 9-hole
golf course in the southern part of the project area, between two international bridges: the Eagle
Pass International Bridge I and the Camino Real International Bridge II. The remains of a
tailings pond for the mining of fluorspar can be seen in the southern end of the project area.

A riparian zone consisting of a dense monotypic stand of giant cane (Arundo donax) lines a
narrow area between the project area and the Rio Grande. The riparian zone averages from 1
to 6 m (3 to 20 ft) in width. There are a number of honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) trees
in the project area and in a few areas along the fence and lighting ROW.

The climate in Maverick County has been described as subtropical steppe. Temperatures in the
summer are consistently high (a record high of 46Â° C [115Â° F] has occurred on several dates)
but are mitigated by low humidity and a steady southeasterly breeze. Winter temperatures are
mild and dry, dropping to freezing an average of one out of every four days from December 3
through February 21. Farmers can expect an average growing season of 285 days annually
(Texas State Historical Association [TSHA] 2004). Total annual precipitation, the greatest
quantity of which occurs during thunderstorms, can vary greatly from 15.24 centimeters (cm)
(6.01 inches [in]) in 1956 to 117 cm (44.36 in) in 1900 and averaged 49.6 cm (19.52 in) annually
from 1939 to 1968. (USDA 1977).

The topography is generally level, particularly in the north central part of the county; otherwise
the county exhibits slightly undulating terrain. The soils in the county are generally gray to black,
cracking and clayey with high shrink-swell potential. In some areas they are light colored and
loamy with limestone bedrock. The majority of the soils in the project area are the Rio Grande
and Zalla soils (Figure 2-1). This soil type is formed in recent alluvium deposits along the flood
plain of the Rio Grande and is found in narrow bands, commonly less than 0.4-km (0.5-mi) wide,

States Department of Agriculture [USDA] 1977). A more detailed description of the soil groups
encountered in each backhoe trench can be found in the geomorphology report in Appendix A.

The terrain along the Rio Grande is characterized by rough hills overlooking stretches of
irrigated farmland. The Rio Grande drains the western half of the county and the Nueces River
drains the eastern half. The principal source of water for domestic and agricultural use is the Rio
Grande. Water wells tap the Carrizo Springs aquifer along the county's eastern edge; a few
wells are located within gravel beds along the Rio Grande (TSHA 2004).

CULTURAL HISTORY

3.1

PREHISTORIC OVERVIEW

The prehistory of the Rio Grande Plain and Delta areas is based on the general chronological
framework of the South Texas Plains region and can be broken down into five temporal periods.
It is important to note that the general chronological framework of south Texas is closely
affiliated with that of the adjacent region of central Texas and on a general level, many cultural
trends spanned across both regions, usually beginning several hundred years earlier in central
Texas (Black 1989).

Temporal periods are principally defined by the presence of diagnostic artifacts, but are
intended to represent more generalized developmental facies based on subsistence practices,
settlement patterns, technology, environment, etc. within the Rio Grande Plain. It is important to
note, however, that the chronological framework for these areas is very cursory and that very
little supporting data, outside of diagnostic artifacts, are available for any one period. Many of
the diagnostic artifacts dating to a particular period often are found in mixed association with
materials from other periods. Furthermore, the radiometric dating of any one period has been
tenuous at best.

The five prehistoric periods are as follows:

3.2

â¢

Paleo-Indian

9200 â 6000 BC

â¢

Early Archaic

6000 â 2500 BC

â¢

Middle Archaic

2500 - 400 BC

â¢

Late Archaic

400 BC - AD 800

â¢

Late Prehistoric

AD 800 â 1600

PALEO-INDIAN PERIOD

On a general level, the Paleo-Indian period represents the first comparatively well-documented
settlement of the New World by aboriginal peoples of Eurasian decent, who crossed the Bering
Land Bridge during the close of the Pleistocene epoch (ca. 11,500 BP [Before Present]). The
Paleo-Indian period in south Texas is defined by the presence of basally ground, lanceolate
projectile points. Subsistence activities are presumed to have heavily relied on large game

Final

hunted by small nomadic bands of 20 to 30 people. No Paleo-Indian sites have been located in
Maverick County (Black 1989).

3.3

ARCHAIC PERIODS

As a general cultural pattern, the Early Archaic period represents the beginnings of an
adjustment, coinciding with the onset of the Holocene Epoch, from former Paleo-Indian
settlement/subsistence patterns of high mobility, partially or largely reliant on large migratory
game, to a more localized hunting and gathering strategy based on a wider spectrum of plants
and animals. The range of faunal material recovered from Early Archaic contexts in south Texas
supports this type of adaptation, and includes freshwater mussels, land snails, turtle bones, and
freshwater drum bones (Black 1989). Early Archaic populations in the region remained in small
bands and were still quite mobile.

The Middle Archaic period represents a continuation of the general archaic lifestyle of broadbased hunting and gathering, in addition to an increase in population growth and expansion,
which can be seen throughout Texas. The presence of grinding slabs and manos, as well as
burned rock features interpreted as roasting or baking hearths (Hall et al. 1986), may also
indicate that peoples of the Middle Archaic period developed an increased dependence on plant
resources. Land snails, freshwater mussels, deer, and other mammals also were exploited
during this period (Black 1989).

The Late Archaic period is considered to be a continuation of population expansion and growth
experienced during the Middle Archaic. For example, the number of known Late Archaic sites in
south Texas is greater than the number of known Middle Archaic sites, and this is seen as a
natural progression of increasing population growth (Black 1989). The proliferation of
cemeteries during the Late Archaic period is seen as further evidence of population growth and
territoriality in the region. The presence of marine shell at inland cemeteries and chert on the
coastal sites suggests that even with the onset of restricted territories, contacts, and even more
formal kinds of exchange, continued between various inland and coastal groups in south Texas
(Black 1989).

The Late Archaic subsistence economy in the Rio Grande Plain area is interpreted as retaining
an emphasis on the acquisition of plant resources. The specialized roasting hearths, first seen

in the Middle Archaic, occur in greater numbers during the Late Archaic period. Steele's (1986)
suggestion that Late Archaic populations were increasing their reliance on the exploitation of
small animals is also seen as further proof that there was a greater reliance on plant utilization
rather than on large to medium-sized game.

3.4

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD

The Late Prehistoric period is marked by the introduction of new technologies in concert with a
continuation of population growth in the region. The bow and arrow are introduced throughout
south Texas sometime after AD 800 but before AD 1200 (Black 1989). With the onset of the
bow and arrow, and perhaps more importantly, the introduction of ceramics, old subsistence
practices of the Archaic disappear from the archaeological record. Bone-tempered pottery
appears at inland sites sometime before AD 1000 (Hall et al. 1986) and is associated with the
Austin (ca. AD 800-1350) and Toyah (AD 1350-1528) horizons (Black 1989).

The Austin horizon started several hundred years earlier in central Texas and then spread
further into south Texas as a result of either population movements or the transference of
culture traits (Black 1989). Although the subsistence economy was still heavily dependent on
gathering a variety of plant foods, hunting seems to have increased in importance during the
Austin horizon in both regions, as indicated by an increased ratio of projectile points to other
tools, and by an increased frequency of deer bones (Black 1989).

The Toyah horizon is characterized by contracting stem arrow points as well as an increase in
the amount of bone-tempered ceramics in association with small endscrapers, and diamondshaped, beveled knives. Overall, there appears to have been a dramatic shift in the economy
towards a greater emphasis on the procurement of large mammals associated with the Toyah
horizon, which coincided with the influx of bison in both central and south Texas. Like the
Austin, the Toyah horizon seems to begin a little earlier in central Texas and then spreads
further south into the interior portion of south Texas. Hunting, especially of bison, attained equal
or greater importance compared to gathering (Black 1989).

3.5

PROTOHISTORIC AND HISTORIC PERIODS

Identified Native peoples who used the area include Caohuiltecans, Jumanos, Lipan Apache,
and some other groups that are simply ambiguously referred to as Indian (Hester 1989).

Currently, the Kickapoo (Texas) Reservation is located in Maverick County in Eagle Pass
(USACE 1999).
3.5.1

Kickapoo History

The Kickapoo are an Algonquin-speaking people who settled in present-day Wisconsin and
Illinois. The 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries were marked by foreign invasions into their tribal
heartland by the French, British, and finally, the Americans. Then, as today, the Kickapoo were
resolute in their refusal to submit to outside cultures. Their skilled and fierce warriors engaged in
a protracted military effort to resist the advancing tide of settlement. Ultimately, the Kickapoo
acceded and were forced to relinquish their homelands, totaling some 5,260,913 ha (13,000,000
ac), for minimal payments in a series of Federal treaties signed in 1809, 1819, and 1903
(Gibson 1963).

The 1819 treaty promised a permanent and substantial reservation in Missouri, but the forced
removal caused deep policy disputes within the Tribe. Two bands refused to leave Illinois and
conducted a series of raids on white settlements. Another band moved to the Missouri lands
and then was pushed further west to Kansas as a result of the 1832 Treaty of Castor Hill. Yet
another band eventually went south to Texas, in the vicinity of Eagle Pass. Complex hostilities
developed and the Kickapoo sided at various times with the U.S., the Republic of Texas, and
Mexico. Finally, due largely to conflicts with non-Indian residents of Texas, the band migrated
still further south, below the U.S./Mexico border. This band is variously referred to as the âTexas
Band of Kickapoo,â the âEagle Pass Kickapoo,â the âTraditional Kickapoo,â or the âMexican
Kickapooâ (Gibson 1963).
In the mid-19th Century, the band negotiated an agreement with Mexico for a land base and
hunting grounds near Nacimiento, Mexico. Some Kickapoo from Kansas joined their fellow tribal
members in Mexico. Hostilities continued with citizens of Texas, which had since been admitted
as a state (Gibson 1963).

In 1871, the U.S. sent a State Department delegation to Eagle Pass to end the border raids and
to clarify the status of the Kickapoo. Before the State Department could negotiate a peaceful
settlement, the Department of War took independent action. In 1873, with no authority from
Mexico and in violation of international law, Col. Randal S. Mackenzie led his Fourth Cavalry in
the infamous âMackenzie's Raidâ on a Kickapoo village in Mexico. Most able-bodied men were

on a hunting expedition. The elders, the ill, women, and children were the primary occupants of
the village. All were killed or taken prisoner. The prosperous village was utterly destroyed: âruin
and desolation now marked the spot - a cyclone could not have made more havoc or a cleaner
sweepâ (Gibson 1963).

The hostages taken at Mackenzie's Raid were used to entice other traditional Kickapoo to move
to the Indian Territory, now Oklahoma. Again the Kickapoo were split, as some 300 were
marched to an Indian territory while about the same number remained in Mexico. Thus by the
1880s various Kickapoo lived in Oklahoma, Mexico, and Kansas. The U.S. government
continued its efforts to consolidate the tribe in one location. In 1883, a reservation of
approximately 80,937 ha (200,000 ac) was established by President Arthur in Oklahoma for the
Kickapoo. Although the land was designated in the Executive Order as being âset apart for the
permanent use and occupation of the Kickapoo Indians,â the familiar pressures for Kickapoo
lands began to build. In 1891 an agreement was negotiated that purported to provide for 32.5 ha
(80 ac) allotments from the Oklahoma reservation for individual Kickapoo; all other tribal lands
would be opened for settlements by non-Indians. Although 2/3 of the tribe disavowed the
agreement, Congress enacted it into a law in 1893 and surplus tribal land was opened for
settlement through a major land rush in 1895. In fact, the âsurplus land amounted to 90% of all
tribal land and was among the richest timber land and bottom land in Oklahomaâ (Gibson 1963).

The breakup of the reservation caused many Oklahoma Kickapoo to leave Oklahoma in disgust
and join a band in Mexico. A few years later after the government had lifted restrictions on
Kickapoo allotments, a major scandal occurred when traditional Kickapoo in Mexico were
swindled out of their Oklahoma land. Gibson (1963) has decried the Kickapoo land scandals as
âa monument to evil genius and deceit.â
During the early 20th Century, the Kickapoo kept their ties alive in spite of being dispersed in
Mexico, Oklahoma, and Kansas. The communities visited back and forth. There was a
considerable amount of intermarriage among the bands.

The Mexican Kickapoo continued to live year-round at Nacimiento during the first several
decades of the 20th Century. In the 1940s, however, events irretrievably altered their existence
at Nacimiento. There was a long and severe drought. A mining company's use of groundwater
lowered the water table. Subsistence hunting was decimated by fencing of nearby ranches and

by overhunting on adjoining lands. The Kickapoo received no support from the Mexican
government, whose officials did not consider them as Mexican citizens. With Nacimiento no
longer capable of providing a viable homeland, the Kickapoo were forced to migrate again and
return to Eagle Pass, Texas (Gibson 1963).

Since World War II, the Kickapoo have resided for the greater part of the time in Eagle Pass.
They use their land at Nacimiento primarily for religious ceremonies. Eagle Pass itself has
religious significance to the Kickapoo because several tribal burial sites are located in the area.
In the summer months, many of the Kickapoo are migrant workers who travel to other regions
and states to follow the harvests (Gibson 1963).

3.5.2

Maverick County History

Maverick County is in the northwestern section of the Rio Grande plain region in southwest
Texas. The Rio Grande forms Maverick County's western and international border with Mexico.
The county is bordered on the north by Kinney County, on the east by Zavala County, and on
the south by Webb County. The county is triangular in shape and contains 333,849 ha (824,960
ac). Eagle Pass, the county seat and most populous community, is in southwestern Maverick
County on the Rio Grande opposite Piedras Negras, Mexico. Three major highways converge at
Eagle Pass, establishing Eagle Pass as the closest international border town to San Antonio.
Eagle Pass is also the gateway to Mexico's Central Super Highway 57, which runs from Piedras
Negras to Mexico City (Pingenot 1971).

Prior to the era of contact with European explorers and settlers, the county was periodically
inhabited by bands of Coahuiltecan Indians and in earlier times by hunter gatherers, whose
discarded metates, manos, and projectile points have been uncovered at former watering holes
and springs throughout the county. The much-traveled Camino Real (Kingâs Highway) crosses
the Rio Grande in southern Maverick County, a part of Texas traversed by more early Spanish
explorers and settlers than any other section of the state.

Fernando de AzcuÃ© made a punitive expedition pursuing Indians into the county in 1665. In
1675 the Bosque-Larios expedition entered the county near the site of present Quemado. It is
believed that the first Mass ever celebrated on what is presently Texas soil was held by
Franciscan members of the Bosque-Larios expedition on May 15, 1675, at a place they called
San Isidro. In 1688 Alonso De LeÃ³n followed the Camino Real across the county in route to Fort

the MarquÃ©s de San Miguel de Aguayo in 1720, and Pedro de Rivera y VillalÃ³n in 1727 crossed
the area. Local tradition suggests that a French trading post was established near Frenchman
Springs northeast of the site of Quemado in the 1720s. The post may have been connected with
the expedition of Domingo RamÃ³n and Louis Juchereau de St. Denis to the area around 1714 to
1717. The Canary Islanders got their first impression of their new country in the area of present
Maverick County in 1730. In 1766 Diego Ortiz Parrilla set off across the area on his way to the
Texas Gulf Coast. Samuel A. Maverick, a captive of Mexican troops on his way to Perote
Prison, and Cherokee Indian leader Sequoyah, on his way to San Fernando de las Rosas,
crossed the Rio Grande in Maverick County in the early 1800s (Pingenot 1971).

The earliest record of Anglo settlement in the area of Maverick County occurred in the spring of
1834, when Dr. John Charles Beales and his Dolores colonists crossed the Rio Grande near the
site of present Eagle Pass and reported seeing an American hunter, his wife, and children, and
a family of five Shawnee Indian beaver trappers. Although direct trade with Texas was forbidden
by the Mexican government following the Texas Revolution, Mexican villages near the Rio
Grande continued an underground trade with San Antonio by using the Pacuache Crossing of
the Rio Grande and a smuggler's trail immediately north of the Camino Real. This trail was used
by Mexican General AdriÃ¡n Woll in route to San Antonio in 1842. In the spring of 1848 Capt.
John A. Veatch, in command of a company of Texas Mounted Volunteer militia, set up a camp
and observation post on the Rio Grande near Paso de los Adjuntos, a ford at the junction of the
Rio Escondido and the Rio Grande. Veatch referred to this location as Eagle Pass, although the
original Paso del Ãguila (Pass of the Eagle) was located west of the Veatch site several miles
upriver on the RÃ­o Escondido. On March 27, 1849, Capt. Sidney Burbank established Fort
Duncan, previously known as Camp Eagle Pass, on a site 3.2 km (2 mi) north of the ford at
Adjuntos Pass (Pingenot 1971).

History of Eagle Pass

A steady stream of emigrants bound for the gold fields of California made their way to Fort
Duncan in caravans bearing such names as the Natchez California Company, the Defiance
Gold Hunters, and the Mississippi Mining and Trading Company. Henry Matson, a member of
one of the California convoys, borrowed a soldier's tent and with two kegs of liquor opened the
first saloon in the area at the growing settlement by the fort locally called California Camp. San
Antonio merchant James Campbell established a trading post at Eagle Pass and was soon

joined by William Leslie Cazneau, who moved to the border to speculate in lands. Cazneau and
San Antonio banker John Twohig, who owned much of the land in future Maverick County along
the Rio Grande and who at one time leased the property of Fort Duncan to the Federal
government, laid out a plan of Eagle Pass in 1850. That same year a Mexican garrison was
established on the opposite bank from Fort Duncan, and the village of Piedras Negras was
founded (Pingenot 1971).

Ranching activity began as early as 1765 on the 25-league Spanish grant of San Juan Bautista
resident Antonio Rivas. This land would later become part of Maverick County. Around 1850
Cazneau started ranching on land that had previously been the upper portion of the Rivas grant.
Cazneau was joined at his ranch in the spring of 1850 by his wife, author Cora Montgomery
(Montgomery 1966 [1852]).

The community that grew up around Fort Duncan acquired the county's first post office in 1851.
Eagle Pass's regional isolation was significantly altered with the establishment of a stage line
from San Antonio in 1851. During the decade before the Civil War, the area was a haven for
outlaws, slave hunters, and other disreputable people. Frederick Law Olmsted visited Eagle
Pass in 1854 and noted the many slave hunters and runaway slaves residing in Piedras Negras,
as well as the many saloons and gambling houses, which catered to Fort Duncan's soldiers and
other unsavory characters. In 1855 an international incident was brought about by James H.
Callahan, whose pursuit of Indian raiders into Mexico ended in the looting and torching of
Piedras Negras, Mexico, after an encounter with Mexican forces at La Marama on the RÃ­o
Escondido (Pingenot 1971).

The abandonment of Fort Duncan during the Civil War enabled the Indian population to gain
control of the region; both American and Mexican inhabitants suffered tremendous loss of life
and property. Following the war, the Black Seminole Scouts were organized at Fort Duncan to
aid in the control of the Indians. The last Indian raid in the county occurred in 1877; the site of
the gruesome mutilation of three traders, eight miles northeast of Eagle Pass, was for many
years afterwards known as Deadman's Hill. Saloons, gambling houses, and smuggling
operations proliferated in and around Eagle Pass during Reconstruction. The infamous J. King
Fisher and his followers dominated the town, the county, and the courts throughout this period.
After the Civil War, Eagle Pass continued as a garrison town and focal point for trade with
Mexico and as a center for stock raising and ranching. The main line of the Galveston,

Harrisburg and San Antonio Railway was extended west from San Antonio around 1880, after
which a 56-km (35-mi) branch line was constructed by the Rio Grande and Pecos Railway south
to Eagle Pass from Spofford in 1882. This rail line connected with the Mexican Railway in
Piedras Negras and greatly enhanced the region's international trade potential (Pingenot 1971).

Although the county was established in 1856, it was not until September 4, 1871, that it was
officially organized. Telegraph communication reached Eagle Pass in November of 1875 with
the completion of a military line between Fort Clark and Fort Duncan. The historic Maverick
County Courthouse was completed by pioneer builder William Hausser on April 4, 1885, at a
cost of $20,489. The courthouse, site of the celebrated Dick Duncan murder trial in 1889,
exhibits a modified Gothic architecture with high windows and an overall Spanish fortress
appearance. This unique structure was declared a Texas historic landmark in September 1971.
Places of interest include the Fort Duncan Museum in Eagle Pass and the Eagle Pass Auxiliary
Air Field in Quemado (TSHA 2004). The only NRHP listed property near the project area is
historic Fort Duncan (41MV2).

PREVIOUS CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEYS

Many portions of Maverick County in southwestern Texas have been examined through
archaeological surveys and small testing projects. The Eagle Pass area has been the focus of
much cultural resource management work because of local development.

However, a

sophisticated understanding of cultural history, ecological adaptations, and archaeological site
formation are underdeveloped. The accretion of survey data and limited excavations in the
general area has not addressed the difficulty of interpreting sites that appear to represent very
short term visits by small groups of people during the last 9,000 years (USACE 2000).

Controlled stratigraphic information is available from nearby areas in Maverick County (Vierra
1998) and northeastern Mexico (Nance 1992). A summary of pertinent work in Maverick County
and the Eagle Pass area is provided by Uecker (1994). Evidence of Paleo-Indian occupation
was scant. Only a single site was identified as Late Prehistoric, and two 19th - 20th Century
historic sites are tabulated.

Clearly the consensus is that the majority of identifiable

archaeological occupations span the Early-Late Archaic (~8000-1000 BP) time periods.

It

should be noted that, as with better studied areas of North America, some âArchaicâ lifeways
persisted until late prehistoric times (Frison 1978). The Maverick County Courthouse and Fort
Duncan (41MV2), within Eagle Pass, are the only sites in Maverick County currently listed in the
NRHP (Davis and Jones 1993; Mercado-Allinger et al. 1996; Potter 1990; TSHA 2004).

PREVIOUS ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEYS

A search through the TARL records for previously surveyed areas revealed that there were 11
surveys conducted within 1.6 km (1.0 mi) of the project area (Table 4-1, Figure 4-1). The
majority of these surveys were conducted as part of a study for the Environmental Protection
Agency/Texas Water Development Board (EPA/TWDB) (Potter 1990; Hubbard and Fox 1990).
Other surveys were conducted by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Texas
Department of Water Resources (TDWR).

Site 41MV2 is the designation for Fort Duncan. The site is bounded on the east by Monroe St.,
on the north by Garrison St., on the south by the Eagle Pass city limits, and on the west by the
Rio Grande (Bell and Hume 1971). The fort, previously known as Camp Eagle Pass was
established in 1849 and many of the original buildings still stand today. One of the buildings
houses the Fort Duncan museum. This site was placed on the NRHP in 1971. The remaining
buildings at Fort Duncan are typical examples of mid-19th Century frontier military architecture.
These buildings are load-bearing stone structures with little or no architectural detailing. The
buildings have rough surfaced ashlar walls, laid up irregularly with few attempts at coursing,
except at the corners. The stones themselves are irregular in size and shape, varying from
rough rubble to unevenly hewn blocks and small boulders. There was usually an attempt to
reinforce the strength of the wall by laying large stones at the corners of the structures (Webb
1952).

Fort Duncan was established on the east side of the Rio Grande in 1849, when Captain S.
Burbank occupied the site with Companies A, B, and F of the First U.S. Infantry. It was the 5th
of the cordon of posts established in 1849 to protect the frontier from Indians (Webb 1952).

A few permanent buildings were constructed at the post in 1850. Although originally garrisoned
as an outpost to protect against Indians, Fort Duncan was significant because of the trade with
Mexico which crossed at Eagle Pass and because of its location on the California road. In spite
of the post's strategic location, Fort Duncan was abandoned in May 1859. During the Civil War,
the post was known as the Rio Grande Station and served as a station for the Frontier
Regiment, a unit raised by the Texas legislature. The post was a vital supply point for munitions
acquired in Mexico for the Confederacy. Federal troops reoccupied Fort Duncan in 1868, and
the post saw active service until 1883. In 1870 the famous Seminole-Negro Indian Scouts were
organized at the post and later won national recognition under the leadership of John L. Bullis.
Fort Duncan was reactivated in 1917 and finally abandoned in 1922 (Webb 1952). The City of
Eagle Pass purchased the land in 1938 and the area was converted into a recreational park.
Work Projects Administration labor did some reconstruction and repair to the remaining post
buildings (Webb 1952).

Jackson and Hall (1976) conducted a cultural resources pedestrian survey in 1976 for the City
of Eagle Pass. The survey concentrated along the main arroyo that bisects Eagle Pass. The
city had plans to pave the sides of the arroyo with flagstones and to landscape the area as part

of a beautification project (Jackson and Hall 1976). These modifications were observed during
the current investigation conducted by GSRC and PAI. Three archaeological sites, 41MV53,
41MV55, and 41MV56, were recorded during the Jackson and Hall survey.

Site 41MV53 is located on the south bank of the arroyo that bisects the golf course between the
two international bridges.

It is a lithic scatter near the Maverick County Hospital and was

located during the Arroyo Channelization Survey conducted by Jackson and Hall (1976).
Among the artifacts found were a chert biface fragment, cores, flakes, and a mussel shell. The
site was approximately 20 m x 20 m (65 ft x 65 ft) in area. Due to its disturbed nature, it was
found to be not eligible for placement on the NRHP.

Site 41MV55, also recorded during the Arroyo Channelization Survey, is located in a vacant lot
northwest of Leona St. and Nedina St. This was a lithic scatter on top of a slightly eroded gravel
surface. Among the artifacts uncovered at this site were the basal portion of an Angostura
point, two bi-face fragments, one core, and seven flakes. The site was found to be far enough
away from the arroyo that channelization would have no direct impact. The site was determined
eligible for placement on the NRHP and was submitted for inclusion (Jackson and Hall 1976).

Site 41MV56, recorded as part of the Arroyo Channelization Survey, is located on the west bank
of the arroyo between Leona St. and Ford St. This was a lithic scatter with two hearth areas
uncovered. Among the artifacts at this site were one non-diagnostic projectile point, numerous
flakes, chips, and cores. The artifacts were scattered over a 50-m (164-ft) long area, situated
between the arroyo channel and the railroad tracks that bisect downtown Eagle Pass. This site
was found to be far enough away from the arroyo that channelization would have no direct
impact. The site was recommended eligible for the NRHP and was submitted for inclusion
(Jackson and Hall 1976).

Site 41MV237 was located by Blanton and Associates in 1998, after bones were discovered
during the construction of the Camino Real International Bridge II. The bones were determined
to be from a horse. Because the bones were found with associated historic cultural materials in
the proximity of Fort Duncan (Site 41MV2), it was determined that further investigations were
needed to establish the nature and extent of the site. Site 41MV237 is situated in deep Rio
Grande alluvium, 40 m (131 ft) north of the Camino Real International Bridge II, on the southern
end of the project area, involved surface collections, the excavation of 11 backhoe trenches,

and one 2 m x 2 m (6 ft x 6 ft) test unit. Backhoe trenching was used to provide larger scale
visibility of archaeological deposits and to determine the geomorphic and soil contexts of these
sites.

All 11 backhoe trenches were profiled and standard soil descriptions performed on

identified soil and sedimentary horizons. The materials collected at this site included wire and
brick fragments, pieces of flat metal, bone (faunal), bottle glass, nails, tin can fragments, and
charred wood found between 2.0 m (6.6 ft) and 2.5 m (8.2 ft) in depth. This area was found to
have extensive disturbances from previous industrial activity and the recent removal of fluorspar
tailing (Brown and Anthony 1998).

Fluorspar is a major ingredient in aerosols, fire

extinguishers, and fast-drying cleaning agents (BGS 2005). Remnants of one of the tailing
ponds can be seen in the southern portion of the project area in Figure 1-2. The trenching at
this site revealed that, although the area was highly disturbed, the sediments revealed in the
trench walls were part of one single historic alluvial terrace deposit. The information gathered
from these trenches suggest that, because there is a lack of historic artifacts below a depth of
2.5 m (8.2 ft), the settlement of Eagle Pass can be represented from this depth to the ground
surface. Because the material was found in highly disturbed flood deposits, the site was not
deemed historically significant and was found to be ineligible for the NRHP (Brown and Anthony
1998).

Site 41MV65 was recorded during a survey for the TDWR by Fox and Whitsett (1979). This site
is located on a broad, flat elevated terrace of the Rio Grande, below a residential neighborhood,
and approximately 500 m (1640 ft) west of US 277 at Rio Road and Second St. This site was a
thin scatter of prehistoric cultural material buried in fine pinkish-tan flood silts of an elevated
secondary terrace of the Rio Grande. Scattered evidence was observed in cut banks of an
arroyo, cutting back into the terrace from the river to the lower slope of the hill on which
residential Eagle Pass is located. The site is along the banks of the Rio Grande, north of the
current investigation. Deposits were shallow and the cultural material found was denser along
the lower slope, away from the river. Dense mesquite and brush covered the area. Artifacts
found included burned rock (sandstone and gravels), chipping debris, and a possible
groundstone. This site was disturbed in many areas by erosion and earth moving and was
determined to be not eligible for the NRHP (Fox and Whitsett 1979).

Site 41MV66 is another site recorded during the TDWR survey by Fox and Whitsett (1979).
This is in the same area as Site 41MV65, approximately 500 m (1640 ft) west of US 277, at

Roswell Street. It is situated on a gradual slope of secondary terrace of the Rio Grande at the
base of the lower slope of a high sandstone and gravel terrace on which a residential
neighborhood is located and is adjacent to a late 19th to early 20th Century Mexican/American
single-family dwelling. Material recovered at this site were 1880s to 1930s bottle glass and a
turn of century blue on white, white paste earthenware sherd. There were scattered brick and
sandstone structural remains and associated refuse accumulation spread across the surface of
pinkish-tan silts at the base of a hillside overlooking an extensive river terrace pasture covered
in brush, grasses and weeds. A shallow swale, which forms the head of a huge arroyo, runs
through the site. An associated garbage dump is located along a portion of the arroyo bank.
Mesquite, brush and grass cover the area. This site was disturbed in many areas by erosion
and earth moving and is not eligible for placement on the NRHP (Fox and Whitsett 1979).

The cultural resources investigation of the project area involved performing a pedestrian survey
over the entire 63 ha (155 ac) project area and the excavation of three backhoe trenches in the
fence and lighting project corridor north of the Eagle Pass International Bridge I. The pedestrian
survey consisted of a visual survey of the ground surface across the entire project area. The
project area was traversed in 30 m (98 ft) intervals, spaced approximately 30 m (98 ft) apart,
and the ground was inspected for the presence of cultural material.

Due to the routine

maintenance of the grounds of the athletic field and golf course, the project area had between
90 and 100 percent surface visibility. All of the land in the project area south of the Eagle Pass
International Bridge I has had cultural resource surveys performed in the past (see Table 4-1
and Figure 4.1). Some of the previous cultural resource surveys (Brown and Anthony 1998;
Collins 1991; and Davis and Jones 1993) have shown that there is an appreciable depth to the
alluvial soils (>6 m [20 ft]) in the project area. Because of this, it was determined that, along
with the pedestrian survey, backhoe trenching would be necessary.

The geomorphology survey involved the use of a backhoe to excavate three series of trenches
along the fence and lighting project corridor (see Figure 1-3). After reviewing the engineering
drawings, GSRC found that the light posts and fence required that the ground be excavated to
approximately 1.8 m (6 ft). Because of this depth requirement and the depth of the alluvial soils
in the project area (>1.0 m [3.3 ft]), it was determined that shovel testing would not be sufficient
enough to reveal the presence of cultural materials. After consulting with the THC and the
USACE, a decision was made to excavate three backhoe trenches within the fence and lighting
project corridor. Each trench was excavated to an approximate depth of 2.0 m (6.6 ft) and was
about 0.6 m (2 ft) wide. The trench on the north (BHT-1) and the trench on the south (BHT-3)
were excavated in an âLâ shape to be better able to observe and record the stratigraphy of the
area. The middle trench (BHT-2) was a straight line excavation. The length of the north and

south trenches was 10 m (33 ft) and the length of the middle trench was 15 m (50 ft). BHT-1
was offset slightly to the west of the centerline of the fence and lighting corridor to prevent
tearing up the dirt road extending north from Ryan Street. BHT-2 was located slightly to the
east of the fence and lighting corridor because of the slope of the land in the center of the
corridor.

The excavated soil was randomly screened for the presence of cultural artifacts.

Samples of artifacts found were recorded and photographed and the photographs are included
in Section 6. All artifacts found were returned in situ in each trench. The locations of the three
trenches were recorded with a Trimble Global Positioning System (GPS) unit.

CURRENT INVESTIGATIONS

A pedestrian survey was conducted over the entire project area. Since almost all of this area
has been heavily impacted by decades of vehicle and foot traffic and because most of the area
is currently occupied with athletic facilities, there were no cultural artifacts located on the
surface. There are a few standing structures within the project area, but these were found to
not be culturally significant.

Impacts from the proposed fence and light installation is expected to be 2.0 m (6.6 ft) deep,
therefore BHTs were excavated to that depth, or slightly deeper, within the fence and lighting
corridor. Figure 6-1 shows the BHTs in relation to the flood plain (T0) and flood terrace surface
(T1). The north and south trenches (BHT-1 and BHT-3) were excavated in an âLâ pattern in
order to expose as many of the sedimentary and cultural zones as possible. The middle trench
(BHT-2) was on a straight north-south axis, generally parallel to the Rio Grande. Photographs
were taken of the trenches and some of the more pertinent artifacts. The results of the backhoe
trenching are summarized below. A detailed report of the findings is located in Appendix A.

of pale brown (10YR 6/3) to brown (10YR 5/3) mud and silt or very fine sand, all capped by a
thin laminae of mud. The exceptional preservation of sedimentary structures throughout and
the presence of corroded metal artifacts within the gravel-filled flood chutes suggest that the
upper deposits (2-3 m [6-10 ft]) of the Rio Grande floodplain at Eagle Pass probably date to the
late 19th or 20th centuries. It is therefore unlikely that the deposits below the floodplain surface
contain prehistoric archaeological sites. In fact, it is probable that the larger gravel-filled flood
chute observed at the eastern end of this segment of BHT-1 relates to one of the larger 20th
Century floods (e.g., 1919, 1954) recorded on the Rio Grande (Kibler 2006).

There were a number of bricks of different origin
and manufacture in the upper 1.0 m (3.3 ft) of this
trench (Photograph 2). Also recovered were a
few sherds of whiteware and one piece of
terracotta (Photograph 3). Palm-sized pieces of
coal were found in the upper 0.3 m (1.0 ft) of the
profile.

Coal was once mined north of Eagle

Pass and is found throughout this region of
Maverick County.

There were bricks and

sandstone structural remains found at Site

BHT-1

41MV66, approximately 1.6 km (1.0 mi) to the
north and upriver from the project area.

It is

possible that the periodic flooding of the Rio
Grande may have carried some of these bricks
downstream to be deposited in the project area.
However, the majority of the bricks found in BHT1 had sharp corners, which would indicate that
they had not traveled a very long distance. The
bricks were probably washed down as debris
from the terrace to the east of the project area
during one of the floods.

BACKHOE TRENCH-2

This trench was offset slightly to the east of the
fence and lighting corridor to prevent tearing up
the dirt road that runs parallel to the athletic
field. Deposits below the flood terrace surface
(T1)

were

examined

in

BHT-2,

situated

approximately in the middle of two standing
structures (Figure 6-3, Photograph 4).

The

structure to the north is a neighborhood auto
repair shop and the building to the south is a
storage area for booths and tables that appear

Photograph 4. BHT-2 looking south

to be used for periodic flea markets.

The 233-cm (92-in) thick profile of this trench consists of massive overbank silts and an upwardcoarsening very fine sand and gravel (Figure 6-3). Zone 1 (0-117 cm [46 in]) is a very pale
brown (10YR 7/3) massive silt with 10 percent granule-sized rounded gravels dispersed
throughout the zone. Historic period artifacts, including metal wire, whiteware sherds, plastic
items, and chunks and fragments of coal are scattered throughout the zone.

Below this

disturbed zone is Zone 2 (117-158 cm [46-62 in), an upward-coarsening bed of very pale brown
(10YR 7/3) very fine sand and gravels consisting of small limestone pebbles and chunks of coal.
The upward-coarsening trend may be the result of a coarse bar deposit migrating or prograding
downstream during a flood event (Kibler 2006). Below this is Zone 3 (158-233 cm [62 â 92 in]),
a massive pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt containing a few scattered chunks of coal.

As with the deposits observed below the floodplain surface (T0), those below the flood terrace
(T1), (at least the upper few meters) are also modern and are probably no older than 200 years.
This is based on the exceptional preservation of sedimentary structures and the presence of
19th and 20th Century artifacts scattered throughout the upper deposits.

Prehistoric

archaeological sites of good contextual integrity may be present below the flood terrace, but at
depths far below project related impacts. The presence of gravel-filled flood chutes below both
surfaces suggests that the potential for structural historic remains (e.g., privies, house
foundations, cisterns) is also low (Kibler 2006).

this footer is part of the foundation for a

Wueste. Over the following years, the house had undergone a series of flooding events of the
Rio Grande and was eventually inundated and destroyed in a 1932 flood (Stockley 2006). The
NRHP eligibility and the overall area of 41MV308 could not be determined from the backhoe
testing. The proposed fence and light installation is not expected to impact the site due to the
depth of deposits and limited excavation required for construction. However, because the total
area of the site has not been ascertained, archaeological monitoring is recommended in the
area during excavation for the fence and light installation.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the results of the pedestrian survey and backhoe trenches, GSRC has concluded
that, except for the limestone block footings (41MV308) buried approximately 150 to 170 cm
(4.9 to 5.5 ft) below the flood terrace surface in the north-south segment of BHT-3, no intact
historic structural remains were encountered. No prehistoric artifacts were discovered in any of
the three backhoe trenches and there were no significant historic cultural resources identified in
BHT-1 or BHT-2.

GSRC obtained a drawing (Figure 7-1), and a historical photograph (Figure 7-2) of the building
encountered in BHT-3. The photograph was taken during the 1919 flood. The drawing and
photograph, obtained from the curator at the Fort Duncan Museum, show the building situated
at the northwestern corner of the intersection of Garrison Street and Ryan Street, which is
slightly north of the northern-most bridge crossing the Rio Grande.

The building was

determined to have been a large two-story structure, built in 1864 by the Wueste family, one of
many German immigrant families that moved into the area during the middle of the 19th Century.
According to a local newspaper:

âDaniel Wueste built a large two-story rock house. . . which stood to the right of the
present bridge and was a landmark for more than a half century. Successive floods
damaged it, until it was unsafe, and the flood of 1932 destroyed the final ruins of the
interesting and historic old house. For many years after it was built, Daniel Wueste had
a large general merchandise store on the first floor and the family lived upstairs.â (Eagle
Pass News Guide & Sunday News 1948)
Further archival research found that the building was inundated in a flood in 1919 before it was
eventually destroyed in a large flood in 1932 (Figure 7-2) (Stockley 2006).
The survey recorded one historic site (41MV308) that dates from the middle 19th to early 20th
Century. The NRHP eligibility of the site could not be determined from the backhoe trench
testing. Because of the limited construction necessary to install the fence and lights, impacts to
the housing foundation revealed at BHT-3 are not anticipated. However, it is recommended that
there be a qualified archaeological monitor present during the construction in this section of the
project area to ensure no adverse impacts would occur to 41MV308, and to record any cultural
materials that may be uncovered.

APPENDIX A
GEOMORPHOLOGY REPORT

Quaternary Geomorphology and Archeological Potential of the Project Area
by
Karl W. Kibler
Prewitt and Associates, Inc.
Austin, Texas

The Rio Grande valley at Eagle Pass, Texas, incises upper Cretaceous clays, sandstones,
limestones, and coal seams of the Escondido and Olmos Formations (Bureau of Economic Geology
1976).

Upland surfaces are mantled with well-rounded cherts and other quartzitic and igneous

pebbles and cobbles of late Tertiary or early Quaternary age (cf. Uvalde gravels).
Two late Quaternary constructional surfaces are present in the project area (Figure 1).
The more-extensive surface is the modern floodplain (T0) of the Rio Grande, while a narrow flood
terrace surface (T1) lies wedged between the floodplain and the valley wall of the Rio Grande at 23 m above the floodplain.

Entisols of the Rio Grande and Zalla series are mapped on the

floodplain surface, while Inceptisols of the Lagloria series are mapped on the flood terrace surface
(Stevens and Arriaga 1977). The project area traverses these two surfaces, and deposits below
the surfaces and the archeological potential of these deposits were examined through the profiles
of three backhoe trenches.

The nature of the deposits and chronological and contextual

interpretations are presented below with more-detailed stratigraphic descriptions given in Table
1. The neutral terms âzoneâ is used for profile descriptions to allow geologic and pedogenic
variation in the profile to be described under the same nomenclature. For each zone (numbered
sequentially from the surface down), the depth below surface, thickness, Munsell color (dry),
texture, consistence, inclusions, and the nature of the contact with next lower unit were recorded.
Textural classifications are based on field estimates (see Olson 1976:19) of the relative
proportions of particle sizes less than 2.0 mm in diameter (i.e., sand, silt, and clay). In some
instances, textural classes based on the percentages of gravels and the ratio of sand to mud (see
Folk 1954, 1974) were more appropriate and used to describe the textural properties of zones.

Figure 1.

Project area map depicting geomorphic surfaces and backhoe trench

locations.

Table 1. Profile descriptions of backhoe trenches.

The surface of the modern floodplain at Eagle Pass, Texas, is ca. 3-4 m above the Rio
Grande channel. The deposits below this surface were examined in Backhoe Trench 1, an Lshaped trench at the northern end of the project area. Two profiles, east and south walls, were
recorded and described (Figure 2). The east wall profile, recorded in the north-south segment of
Backhoe Trench 1, is 185 cm thick and exhibits of a series of gravel-filled flood chutes and
overbank flood alluvium. Zone 1 (0-24 cm) is a pale brown (10YR 6/3) muddy sandy gravel. The
gravels consist of clast-supported rounded siliceous (cherts and quartzites) and limestone pebbles
and cobbles. This gravel-filled flood chute deposit overlies Zone 2 (24-70 cm), a pale brown (10YR
6/3) muddy very fine sand. Thin (1-5 mm) horizontal laminations of mud and very fine sand are
preserved throughout Zone 2, as are stringers or beds of detrital coal chunks (10-40 mm in size)
at 37 and 52 cm below the surface. From 70 to 185+ cm are a series of upward-fining overbank
alluvial deposits (Zones 3-8). These deposits range from 13 to 25 cm thick and consist of pale
brown (10YR 6/3) muddy very fine sands capped by very thin beds of brown (10YR 5/3) mud.
Throughout these deposits thin horizontal laminae of mud and sand are preserved, suggesting a
very recent age (probably late nineteenth to twentieth century) for these deposits.

Figure 2. Profiles from Backhoe Trench 1.

Looking at the modern floodplain in a east-west cross section, the south wall segment of
Backhoe Trench 1 displays several recent gravel-filled flood chutes bounded by overbank alluvial
facies (see Figure 2). A detailed description of a small segment of the south wall profile of

Backhoe Trench 1 is in Table 1. These gravel-filled flood chutes contain clast-supported rounded
siliceous and limestone pebbles and cobbles. Some of the flood chutes contain small chucks of
coal and heavily corroded or oxidized metal items, while others are capped by thin to medium
beds of brown (10YR 5/3) mud. The mud drapes exhibit oxidized root casts and oxidized cleavage
planes. These flood chutes incise overbank alluvium characterized by a series of upward-fining
deposits consisting of fine interbedded laminae of pale brown (10YR 6/3) to brown (10YR 5/3) mud
and silt or very fine sand, or massive silts, all capped by thin laminae of mud. The exceptional
preservation of sedimentary structures throughout these overbank facies and the presence of
corroded metal artifacts within the gravel-filled flood chutes suggest that the upper deposits (ca.
2-3 m) of Rio Grande floodplain at Eagle Pass probably date to the late nineteenth or twentieth
centuries.

It is therefore unlikely that the deposits below the floodplain surface contain

prehistoric archeological sites. In fact, it is probable that the larger gravel-filled flood chute
observed at the eastern end of this segment of Backhoe Trench 1 (see Figure 2) relates to the one
of the larger twentieth century floods (e.g., 1919, 1954) recorded on the Rio Grande.
Deposits below the flood terrace surface (T1) were examined in Backhoe Trenches 2 and 3,
placed in the middle and southern portions of the project area, respectively. The 233-cm-thick
profile of Backhoe Trench 2 consists of massive overbank silts and an upward-coarsening very
fine sand and gravel (Figure 3). Zone 1 (0-117 cm) is a very pale brown (10YR 7/3) massive silt
with 10 percent granule-sized rounded gravels dispersed throughout the zone. Historic period
artifacts, including metal wire, whiteware sherds, and even plastic items, and chunks and
fragments of coal also are scattered throughout the zone. Below this disturbed zone is Zone 2
(117-158 cm), an upward-coarsening bed of very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very fine sand and gravels
consisting of small limestone pebbles and chunks of coal. The upward-coarsening trend may be
the result of a coarse bar deposit migrating or prograding downstream during a flood event (Miall
1996:50). Below this is Zone 3 (158-233+ cm), a massive pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt containing a
few scattered chunks of coal.

Figure 3. Profiles from Backhoe Trenches 2 and 3.

The profile of Backhoe Trench 3, another L-shaped trench, was recorded in the east-west
segment of the trench. The 236-cm-thick profile consists of beds of thinly laminated silts and
muds and gravels.

Historic period (nineteenth and twentieth centuries) artifacts, including

bottle glass, ceramics, and miscellaneous metal items, are scattered throughout the profile. Zone
1 (0-33 cm) is a pale brown (10YR 6/3) horizontally laminated silt and mud. Below this is Zone 2
(33-60 cm), a gravel-filled flood chute containing of small rounded limestone pebbles and angular
chunks of coal. This deposit pinches out to the west. Zone 3 (60-96 cm) is an upward-fining bed
of horizontally laminated pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt to very fine sand. A thick lamina (5 mm) of
mud is preserved at 76 cm. Zone 4 (96-236+ cm) is a bed of thin horizontally laminated pale
brown (10YR 6/3) silt with thick laminae of mud preserved at 100, 135, and 170 cm below the
surface. In Zone 4, limestone blocks or footings of a structure were observed in the west wall of
the north-south segment of the trench. This building foundation extended into the floor of the
trench to an unknown depth.
As with the deposits observed below the floodplain surface (T0), those below the flood
terrace (T1), at least the upper few meters, are also modern, probably no older than 200 years.
This is based on the exceptional preservation of sedimentary structures and the presence of
nineteenth and twentieth century artifacts scattered throughout the upper deposits. Prehistoric
archeological sites of good contextual integrity may be present below the flood terrace, but at
depths far below project related impacts. The presence of gravel-filled flood chutes below both
surfaces suggests that the potential for structural historic remains (e.g., privies, house
foundations, cisterns) is also low. Save for the limestone block footings buried ca. 150 to 170 cm
below the flood terrace surface (T1) in the north-south segment of Backhoe Trench 3, no intact
historic structural remains were encountered. This suggests that either the high-magnitude
flood events of the past 100-150 years obliterated standing structures on the floodplain and flood
terrace surfaces, or such structures were completely razed after the flood events. Either way, it

may be more productive to obtain information about early standing structures in the project area
through archival research rather than from the archeological record, given the dynamic nature of
the project area environment.
