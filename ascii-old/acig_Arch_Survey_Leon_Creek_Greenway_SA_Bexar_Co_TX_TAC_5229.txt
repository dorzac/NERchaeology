Abstract
In May, June, and November of 2009, aci consulting conducted an intensive archaeological survey of the
3.78-mile (6.08-kilometer) Segment II of the Leon Creek Greenway portion of the Linear Creekway
Program. Westward Environmental, Inc. contracted aci consulting to evaluate the real estate acquired by
the City of San Antonio for the construction of a pedestrian and bike trail network. Archaeological work
was carried out under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 5229.
The entire project area, consisting of the proposed trail route and its surrounding real estate, was subject
to 153 shovel tests and intensive pedestrian survey. The survey resulted in the identification of two
previously unrecorded archaeological sites and one historic homestead. One site is an Early Archaic
prehistoric campsite (41BX1810), one is a prehistoric campsite of undetermined age (41BX1811), and the
historic farmstead (41BX1812) reflects construction characteristics of the 1920’s and 1930’s. Two
additional isolated finds were recorded, and archival research was conducted on both potentially historic
isolated finds and the historic farmstead. The newly recorded sites are recommended as not eligible for
nomination to the National Register of Historic Places under Criteria A-D and should not influence the
projected alignment of the pedestrian footpath.
During the survey, an attempt was made to relocate and reassess sites 41BX48, 41BX53, 41BX72, and
41BX232. These four sites have all been destroyed by modern landscape modification, construction,
erosion, and other similar activities.
Sites 41BX47 (combined with 41BX40), 41BX52, 41BX233, and 41BX1064 were also relocated and
reassessed. 41BX47 was relocated and remapped, and the original site boundaries were reestablished.
The locality containing 41BX52 (Pavo Real) extends approximately five meters into the northern part of
the trail area of potential effect (APE). The remainder of the site is located completely within the Loop
1604 right-of-way. The majority of its shallow deposits have been severely impacted by the construction
of Loop 1604 and its eastbound access road. No further work is recommended at this portion of 41BX52.
Site 41BX233 was tested with no subsurface materials recovered and only one surface artifact recorded.
No further work is recommended at 41BX233. Site 41BX1064 was revisited and rerecorded. It has been
subject to erosion, development, and dumping. The only remaining portion of the site rests just outside of
the APE and on the sloping west bank of Leon Creek. No further work is warranted at 41BX1064 based
on poor site integrity.
A trail segment branching off from the main route of the proposed hike and bike trail was planned to
bisect site 41BX47 to provide pedestrian access to one of the small drainage ponds of Leon Creek. Shovel
ii

testing of this arm indicated intact subsurface materials are present, and numerous fire-cracked rock
(FCR) scatters still lie on the surface. Rather than facilitate pedestrian access to the interior of site
41BX47, aci consulting recommends that an alternative route to collection pools adjoining Leon Creek be
proposed. The branch trails, while investigated for this report, have been abandoned, and no construction
will occur on these areas of the site.
aci consulting recommends a four part preservation and protection plan for site 41BX47. First, clean back
fill should be utilized to fill open holes and stabilize the area in and around 41BX47 to prevent erosion,
protect individuals from falling into open areas, and discourage looting. Second, monthly visits should be
conducted for the first six months the trail is open to monitor activity in and around the site. This will be
critical for evaluating the impacts to this resource, and after the initial six months of monitoring the
amount of visitation can be re-assessed in consultation with the Texas Historical Commission. During
these visits, any surface materials will again be collected, and evidence of looting will be observed, noted,
and reported. Third, a complete surface collection is recommended at 41BX47. A surface collection was
conducted on November 22, 2009 and again on January 18, 2010. In addition to the monitoring of the
sites, it is recommended that any visible artifacts be collected during those visits. Artifacts can be
mapped and added to the collection housed at University of Texas-San Antonio. Finally, the City of San
Antonio will post signs at the entrance and egress of the trail and along the southern boundary of site
41BX47. These signs will continue to use the same legal language as other signs utilized along the city
greenways and along the exiting trail.
In addition, long term monitoring for evidence of erosion and possible impact will be conducted at site
41BX52. This will protect potentially intact deeply buried deposits that could still exist at the edge of the
site boundaries. At site 41BX1064, a portion of the site is adjacent to Leon Creek, and, although site
significance cannot be fully determined because most of the site lies outside city property, it is
recommended that monitoring be conducted and additional stabilization measures added if necessary.
The 3.78-mile trail system of the Leon Creek Greenway Segment II was surveyed, and aci consulting
recommends that the Linear Creekway Program proceed with construction of the proposed trail, following
the preservation and protection plan proposed to prevent impacts to site 41BX47.

Introduction

This report summarizes the results of archaeological survey work for Segment II of the Leon Creek
Greenway Project. The City of San Antonio is proposing to add real estate adjacent to Leon Creek to its
existing Linear Creekway Program. The city proposes to place a network of pedestrian trails and bike
paths along Leon Creek, Salado Creek, the Medina River, and their adjoining tributaries. The Leon Creek
Greenway Segment II portion of the project requires the archaeological survey of a 3.78-mile (6.08kilometer) segment of the trail network in northwest San Antonio (Figure 1-1). The project is funded by
the City of San Antonio, and cultural resource studies are guided by the process outlined in the Texas
Administrative Code (13 TAC 26.20). Archaeological work was performed by aci consulting under
contract with Westward Environmental, Inc. This project was conducted under Texas Historical
Commission (THC) permit # 5229 with Meg Thornton as the Principal Investigator, Martha Freeman as
Project Historian, and Jon J. Dowling as Project Archaeologist.
The primary goal of archaeological work was to provide a 100 percent pedestrian survey of the proposed
Leon Creek Greenway Segment II alignment. In addition, shovel testing was conducted along the
alignment and within its easement where possible. Five specific tasks were designed for this survey. First,
an intensive pedestrian survey was conducted within the 250-foot (76.2-meter) corridor (where possible,
based on the boundaries of the property and easements) for the footpath from Babcock Road to Loop
1604. This task included the survey of both high potential areas (such as the historic farmstead site south
of Hausman Road) and low potential areas within easement parcels adjacent to the main trail within the
project area to locate possible historic or prehistoric archaeological sites. Shovel-testing strategies used to
complete this task will be described further in the methodology chapter. In addition, the survey included
the visual corridor and areas of interest including the creek, cut-banks, and creek terraces that occurred
within the City of San Antonio property along the 250-foot corridor.
The second task of this survey was the re-recording of all encountered archaeological sites that have
already been documented. If the sites had not been evaluated within the last five years and had not been
severely impacted by development they were to be re-evaluated. These re-evaluations would be entered
into the Texas Historic Commission (THC) site atlas. The third task undertaken by aci consulting was the
survey and site boundary establishment of 41BX47, which was combined with 41BX40 in 1995 (Tennis
and Hard 1995). This substantial site is located within an easement of an 11.27-acre parcel. The fourth
task was the examination of cut-banks flanking Leon Creek for any visible cultural resources that may
have been exposed. Three locations with cutbanks deeper than three meters were profiled and two
locations with approximately one meter deep cuts were profiled (Appendix A).

Archaeological sites resting within the boundaries of this project area can experience two types of impact:
direct impact from construction of footpaths, trails, and features, and indirect impact from public use,
such as additional trail wear off-path, public collecting of materials within the site, possible vandalism,
etc. The fifth and final task of aci consulting’s survey strategy was to assist in the preservation and
protection of site 41BX47 in the face of direct and indirect impacts along the southwest boundary of the
site along the hike and bike trail. Initially, a branch trail was proposed to bisect the landscape on which
41BX47 rests, potentially leading to direct and indirect impacts. An alternative trail was proposed which
would lessen the impacts by slightly altering the location of this trail. However, the branch trail and
alternative have both been abandoned by the project and will not be constructed.

1.1

The Project Area

The Leon Creek Greenway Segment II project area rests in northwest San Antonio and flanks the segment
of Leon Creek between Loop 1604 in the north and Babcock Road in the south (Figure 1-2). The Area of
Potential Effect (APE) includes a 3.78-mile (6.08-kilometers) segment with a width of construction
impaction not to exceed 24 feet. Several easement parcels adjoining the trail exist within the APE, such as
the one encompassing 41BX47, which were also subject to pedestrian survey. The area surveyed includes
at minimum a 250-foot corridor as well as areas of visual interest such as the creek, cut-banks, and creek
terraces.
The terrain skirting Leon Creek within the project area ranges from flood plains to terraces at varying
elevations. Leon Creek is one of several main streams draining the Edwards Plateau to the north. Leon
Creek flows at a rate of under 1/3 of a liter per second, originating from the Glen Rose and Edwards
formations approximately 10 kilometers upstream. Flow rates are low due to the effects of groundwater
pumping. Prominent drainages in the area include the Guadalupe River to the north and the San Antonio
River to the south and southwest, which is where the Leon Creek empties. Numerous episodes of erosion
and overbank deposition are apparent in the cut bank profiles.

Environmental Setting

The geographic region encompassing the project area is referred to as South Texas. This broad and
diverse landscape includes the Edwards Plateau to the north, the Rio Grande River to the south, the Gulf
of Mexico coastline to the east, and the Lower Pecos region to the west (Norwine 1995). The
environmental and cultural development of Bexar County specifically has been greatly shaped by its
position on the edge of the Edwards Plateau. This ecotonal region provided by the Balcones Escarpment
has generated diverse biotic resources long utilized by the prehistoric inhabitants of present-day San
Antonio. Of the seven biotic provinces of Texas provided by Blair (1950), the San Antonio area lies on
the southern edge of the Balconian Province. The proximity of the two neighboring provinces, the
forested Texan and the arid Tamaulipan, increased the resource variability that would have been available
to prehistoric inhabitants. Numerous springs, aquifers, and rivers are interspersed in and around the
Balcones Escarpment due to the hinge line faulting along the Paleozoic Ouachita structural belt (Foley
and Woodruff 1986). The large underwater reservoir of the Edwards Aquifer lies in west-central Texas
where water percolates through Lower Cretaceous limestone that rests on virtually impermeable preCretaceous formations (Barker et al. 1994). Excellent potable water sources arise as a result of this
percolation. Springs created from the Balcones Escarpment give birth to several rivers in Bexar County.
Rivers generated by the Balcones Escarpment springs include the Guadalupe, Comal, San Marcos,
Blanco, and San Antonio rivers. Since these rivers do not rely much on rainfall as a water source and
drain smaller areas than other rivers in the state, they are shorter and clearer than many other rivers in
Texas.

1.2.1

Geology and Soils

The surface geology of the San Antonio area is the result of the Miocene uplifting that produced the
Edwards Plateau and Balcones Escarpment. The project area landscape consists of Quaternary Alluvium
and Fluviatile terrace deposits, composed primarily of silts and clays overlying ancient alluvium (Barnes
1983). Skirting the northwest portion of the city is an upland projection of Austin limestone made up of
marl, chalk, and limestone left by the receding sea-line of the upper Cretaceous Period. In this area one
finds mostly fine to medium grained Edwards Limestone. Chert nodules that served as lithic sources to
prehistoric populations for more than 11,000 years are commonly found within Edwards limestone
(Banks 1990; Frederick and Ringstaff 1994). The project area landscape consisted primarily of limestone
bedrock with shallow soils in most places.
Soil units within this environment are outlined by the Soil Conservation Service (Taylor et al. 1991), and
consist of Trinity, Frio, and Lewisville soils that are calcareous alluvial deposits. These soils are usually
found on 0-1 percent slopes on riparian terraces. Trinity and Frio soils are characterized by deep, slowly
5

permeable calcareous clays to clay loams with possible gravel layers. The substrate is alluvium, forming a
deep profile of fine sediments. Lewisville soils are distinguished by their deep, dark grayish-brown to
brown calcareous silty clays. The parent material of Lewisville soils is usually ancient alluvium on level
areas on active floodplains. The majority of soils encountered in the project area were Patrick soils,
consisting of gravelly clay loams and silty clays. The specific soil types within the project area are
described in Table 1-1.

1.2.2

Vegetation and Climate

The project area is positioned near an area where the Edwards Plateau, Blackland Prairie, and South
Texas Plains converge, creating a mosaic of vegetation communities (Gould 1969). The Balcones
Escarpment deviates sharply from the thin-soiled limestone uplands and the wide coastal plains. Mixed
live oak, Ashe juniper woodlands and sporadic grassy openings compose the bulk of upland vegetation.
Tree canopy closure, for the most part, is generally low, and Ashe juniper is the most prevalent species.
6

Texas oak and cedar elm also occur in low densities. In upland areas, shrub density varies from low to
dense. Low density species include Texas persimmon, agarita, prickly pear, and mixed grasses. The
Blackland Prairie and South Texas Plains have a gently rolling topography that sustains hickory, red oaks,
and hackberry that accompanies an understory of big bluestem, switchgrass, Virginia creeper, and green
briar (Gould 1969). The majority of trees observed within the project area consisted of oaks, mesquite,
hackberry, and persimmon. The project area provides a good mix of species ranging from cactus to
juniper along the creek (Figure 1-3).
This area of Texas has a subhumid climate as a result of moderate rainfall and fairly warm temperatures
(Bomar 1983). The annual average rainfall for San Antonio is 29.13 inches of precipitation, with the
rainiest months being in May, June, and September (Bomar 1983). Precipitation in Central Texas stems
from the tumultuous transition between Arctic and Gulf of Mexico air masses. Average San Antonio
temperatures range from 39.0-61.7 degrees Fahrenheit (January) to 74.3-94.9 degrees Fahrenheit (July).

Regional Chronology and Cultural Background

The project area is situated on the cusp of Central and South Texas. This culture history will reference
primarily Central Texas regional patterns, but will also include relevant South Texas trends and
developments. One of the major contributing factors behind site locations and site durations in Texas is
related to the availability of water. In Texas, fresh water is a very important resource that is not always
readily available. Bexar County has a strong record of prehistoric human occupation, particularly near
large documented springs (Brune 2002). Spanish explorers in 1632 and 1691 documented native hunting
and gathering bands camping adjacent to recorded springs (Brune 2002). These same locations later
become preferred locations of early Spanish Missions. These choices are all based on the availability of
water. The spring water in Bexar County is generally fresh, alkaline, and very hard. It typically contains
calcium bicarbonate and not enough iron to cause staining but enough to be healthy. Some of the spring
water in the far south of Bexar County can be slightly saline, although it is rare. The major springs along
Leon Creek are the Leon Springs approximately 10 km to the north; at least three other small springs
would have brought water to the project area up until recent history. This contributes to the long
occupation by humans within the project area (Collins et al. 2003).
Once a culture chronology for this region of Texas has been summarized, a brief overview of significant
archaeological work in northern San Antonio will be provided. Specifically, 41BX47 and 41BX52 (Pavo
Real) will be discussed in detail since both sites yielded considerable archaeological data, and portions of
these sites rest on this project’s APE.

2.1

Paleoindian

The arrival of humans in the New World occurred during the Paleoindian period which dates from
11,500-8,800 BP (10,000 – 6,000 B.C.) (Collins 1995). As the Pleistocene period ended, diagnostic
Paleoindian materials in the form of Clovis, Folsom, and Plainview projectile points began to enter the
archaeological record. These points were lanceolate-shaped and fluted for hafting to wooden spears.
Using the launching momentum from atlatls (spear-throwers), large game such as mammoth, mastodons,
bison, camel, and horse were frequently taken (Black 1989). In addition to megafauna, Paleoindian
groups likely harvested less daunting prey including antelope, turtle, frogs, etc. Stylistic changes in
projectile point technology occurred during this later portion of the period, eventually shifting to Dalton,
Scottsbluff, and Golondrina traditions. While widespread in geographic range, these types occurred in
high densities in the High Plains and Central Texas (Meltzer and Bever 1995). One of the oldest
confirmed Clovis sites in North America is arguably the Aubrey Clovis Site (41DN479) in Denton
County, Texas, with a carbon date assay of 11,550 BP (Ferring 2001). Environmental studies suggest that
8

Late Pleistocene climates were wetter and cooler (Mauldin and Nickels 2001; Toomey et al. 1993),
gradually shifting to drier and warmer conditions during the Early Holocene (Bousman 1998). As
megafauna gradually died off during the shift to warmer climates, subsistence patterns shifted toward
smaller game and plant foraging.

2.2

Archaic

The Archaic period, broadly divided into the Early, Middle, and Late Archaic subperiods, signifies a more
intensive reliance on local floral and faunal resources with an increase in the number of projectile point
styles (Collins 1995). The archaeological record begins to indicate more widespread use of burned rock
middens, a wider variety of site functions, and more localized geographic distributions of these materials.

2.2.1

Early Archaic

Hester (1995) places the Early Archaic between 7,950 and 4,450 BP (6,000 – 2,500 B.C.) based on Early
Corner Notched and Early Basal Notched projectile points. Collins’ (1995) dating of the Early Archaic
period to 8,800 to 6,000 BP is founded on unstemmed point types. Around 8,000 BP some styles
transitioned to stemmed varieties such as the Martindale and Uvalde (Black 1989). As the extinction of
megafauna herds took hold, a subsistence shift towards heavier reliance on deer, fish, and plants became
necessary. In the archaeological record, this trend equates to greater densities of ground stone artifacts,
fire-cracked rock midden features, and task specific tools such as Clear Fork gouges and Guadalupe and
Nueces bifaces (Turner and Hester 1999). A great deal of Guadalupe bifaces are recovered near river
drainage systems like the San Antonio River, flowing toward the Gulf Coast off Edwards Plateau, and are
thought to function as primarily woodworking tools in a hafted capacity (Hester 1995), and may have
served as hide defleshing tools to some degree as well (Black and McGraw 1985). Most Early Archaic
open-campsite concentrations were distributed along the eastern and southern margins of the Edwards
Plateau in areas with reliable water sources (McKinney 1981). Population densities were relatively low
and consisted of small bands with a fairly high degree of mobility (Story 1985). Loeve-Fox, Jetta Court
and Sleeper sites are all accurate representative sites of the Early Archaic (Collins 1995).

2.2.2

Middle Archaic

Middle Archaic materials date from about 6,000 to 4,000 BP (2,500 – 1,000 B.C.), and demonstrate an
increased occurrence of multi-use bifacial knives and burned rock middens (Collins 1995). Diagnostic
points from this period include Bell, Andice, Taylor, Nolan, and Travis. The Tortugas point also appears
in Middle Archaic contexts and possibly earlier (Turner and Hester 1999). According to Collins (1995)
the beginning of the Middle Archaic still exhibited large-game hunting of bison. The climate became
much drier towards the end of the Middle Archaic necessitating a heavier reliance on sotol and acorn
9

harvesting (Weir 1976). An expansion of oak woodlands on the Edwards Plateau and Balcones
Escarpment may have been conducive to the intensified exploitation of certain plants (Weir 1976). This
period also experienced population increases, and it is possible that previously scattered bands of huntergatherers began to combine harvesting and processing efforts (Weir 1976). Panther Springs Creek,
Landslide, Wounded Eye and Gibson sites demonstrate well the cultural trends of the Middle Archaic
(Collins 1995).

2.2.3

Late Archaic

The last subperiod of the Archaic falls between 4,000-800 BP (1,000 – 300 B.C.) (Collins 1995). Dart
point diagnostics of the Late Archaic are somewhat smaller, triangular points with corner notches such as
the Ensor and Ellis (Turner and Hester 1999). Other Late Archaic points include Bulverde, Pedernales,
Marshall, and Marcos (Collins 1995). It is not entirely clear whether this period experienced a rise
(Collins 1995; Prewitt 1981) or decline (Black 1989) in population numbers, but large cemeteries, grave
goods, and exotic trade items are known to occur at this time at sites such as Loma Sandia, Rudy Haiduk,
Silo, Ernest Witte and Morhiss Mound in Central and South Texas. Evidence of the Thunder Valley
sinkhole cemetery has suggested that territoriality may have established during the Late Archaic, possibly
as a result of population increase (Bement 1989). The frequency of burned rock middens increases, and
open campsites appear to increase. Characteristic Late Archaic sites include the Anthon and Loeve Fox
sites (Collins 1995).

2.3

Late Prehistoric

There exists some degree of overlap between diagnostic tools that are considered Late Archaic and Late
Prehistoric, but the commonly held date for the beginning of this interval is 1200 BP (300 B.C.). A
hallmark transition for this period is the introduction of the bow and arrow that enabled prehistoric
hunters to harvest prey from greater distances with a lesser need for brushless, wide open spaces required
for atlatl maneuverability in hunting. The use of arrows is indicated by smaller sized projectile points
such as Perdiz and Scallorn. Another turning point in the Late Prehistoric period is the first substantial
presence of pottery in the northern South Texas Plain and Central Texas (Black 1989; Hester 1980; Story
1985). Researchers generally agree that during this period there was a drop in population (Black 1989).
Inter-group conflicts between various bands of hunter-gatherers may have also been an issue based on
evidence of arrow inflicted deaths seen in human remains from various Late Prehistoric cemeteries. Sites
with distinct Late Prehistoric components include the Kyle, Smith and Currie sites (Collins 1995).
Interval divisions for this period are the Austin and Toyah phases. Johnson (1994) believes these phases
to possibly be two distinct cultures (see Black and Creel 1997).
10

The Austin Phase of the Late Prehistoric may demonstrate the most intensive use of burned rock middens
(Black and Creel 1997), and includes the appearance of diagnostic point types Scallorn and Edwards
(Collins 1995; Turner and Hester 1999). During this phase, the use of burned rock middens is still quite
widespread and may even be on the rise (Mauldin et al. 2003). The Toyah subperiod of the Late
Prehistoric suggests interaction between Central Texas and ceramic producing traditions in East and
North Texas due to the presence of bone-tempered plainware ceramics (Pertulla et al. 1995). Ceramics
were in common usage in East Texas by 2,450 BP, but the first Central Texas plainwares did not appear
until ca. 650/700 BP. Other technological traits of this phase include the diagnostic Perdiz point,
alternately beveled bifaces, and specialized processing kits as an adaption to flourishing bison populations
(Ricklis 1992).

2.4

Historic

Since the late A.D. 1500s, Europeans entered South and Central Texas only sporadically and did not settle
there until around A.D. 1700 (Webb 1952). First European contact on the Texas coast most likely began
with the landing of Cabeza de Vaca and the Narvaez expedition survivors in 1528. Later Spanish
incursions recorded insightful information on various Native American tribes such as the Payaya,
collectively referred to as the Coahuiltecans, who at one point lived in the area around modern-day San
Antonio. Late seventeenth-century accounts describe these people as family units of hunter gatherers that
resided near streams and springs, in areas conducive to nut harvesting. These camps were revisited on a
seasonal basis, allowing interaction with different groups along the way as well as the hunting of bison in
open grassland settings (Campbell 1983; Hester 1989). By the eighteenth century, the cultural integrity of
the Coahuiltecans was significantly compromised by European settlers and invasive neighboring Native
American groups, such as the Tonkawa and the Lipan Apache, made possible through access to European
horses. Efficiently skilled Comanche horsemen, in turn, displaced the Lipan Apache culture, effectuating
continuous raids on European and Native American settlements alike in Central Texas (Hester 1989).
Frequently, their incursions took place via historic trails such as the Camino Pinta and the Camino Viejo,
which led in and out of San Antonio de Bexar by at least the eighteenth century.
In response to the continuous threat of Apache and Comanche raiders, as well as the French incursion into
East Texas, an expedition led by Martin de Alarcon founded San Antonio de Bexar Presidio and San
Antonio de Valero Mission in 1718. Indians joined the mission, and within 13 years, a total of five
missions had been established along the San Antonio River.
In 1731, the community’s development as a provincial town was assisted by the arrival of Canary
11

Islanders, and by 1773, the heterogeneous villa composed of Europeans, Black slaves, and mestizos had
become the capital of Spanish Texas. It declared for Mexican independence in 1813, after which it was
decimated by battles. After 1821, the newly independent Mexican government began granting empresario
contracts that encouraged Anglo settlement in Texas. One such empresario and settler, Stephen F. Austin,
helped spearhead a movement by Anglo and Mexican settlers against Mexican authority.

As a

crossroads, San Antonio was the site of several battles for independence, most notably the one at Mission
San Antonio de Valero (the Alamo) in March 1836. The town, as well as the new republic, then entered a
period of political and military turbulence from which it did not recover until after Texas entered the
Union in 1845. Thereafter, it grew rapidly, spurred on by immigration from elsewhere in the United
States and Europe, and its role as a distribution point for the military in Texas and the Southwest. By
1860, San Antonio had become the largest city in Texas, and even the interruption of the Civil War failed
to slow its growth as it became a commercial, military, and railroad center whose sphere of influence
reached to the Gulf of Mexico, the Rio Grande and northern Mexico, and Southwest Texas.
During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, much of San Antonio’s wealth continued to
derive from agriculture, particularly the wool, mohair, and cattle industries, with irrigated crops and
dairying also playing a large role in the city’s economic prosperity. By 1900, it was again the state’s
largest city and remained such until the 1920s. Significant Mexican immigration during the World War I
period altered the demographics of Central Texas, as did the construction of two major military air fields
(Kelly and Brooks) and expansion of the state’s oldest army post (Fort Sam Houston). Continued
investment by the United States in military facilities, together with the South Texas oil boom, expansion
of the banking and other industries, and persistence of agricultural production provided the underpinnings
of consistent economic growth throughout the balance of the twentieth century. Growth was reflected in
commercial development, where high rise buildings changed the urban landscape, and in the scores of
new suburbs that were platted and built out between the 1920s and 1950s. San Antonio stayed largely
within the boundaries of its Spanish charter land until World War II. Thereafter, growth spread steadily to
the north and west, encouraged by improvements to major highways that radiated out from the center of
the city and construction of outer loops, including Loops 410 and 1604.

Archaeological Overview of Northern San Antonio

A short summary of some of the significant sites of Northern San Antonio will be provided in addition to
the review of previously recorded sites within and adjacent to the project area. To begin with, the San
Antonio Springs and Olmos Basin areas contain rich archaeological deposits that have been subject to
numerous investigations. Many of these deposits were destroyed with the construction of Olmos Dam.
However, some investigations have yielded Paleoindian and Archaic artifacts ranging from surface
hearths, bone beds, and lithic tools to human burials (Orchard and Campbell 1954; Lukowski 1988).
Paleoindian materials were also observed at the St. Mary’s Hall Site (41BX229) along Salado Creek. The
integrity of this site was compromised by a fair amount of looting, but the Center for Archaeological
Research (CAR) at The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) and the Southern Texas
Archaeological Association (STAA) were able to recover a significant portion of cultural materials in
1977. Plainview and Angostura projectile points were collected suggesting a late Paleoindian occupation,
but this assessment may be revised after a regional comparison of like points with differing contextual
data is conducted (Hester 1978, 1990, 1995). South of that location rests the Granberg site (41BX271),
investigated in the 1960’s by the Witte Museum (Schuetz 1966) and in the 1970’s by the CAR and
revisited by the CAR in 2005 (Thompson 2006). In 1975, the Walker Ranch National Archaeological
District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and included several sites. Investigated by
the Texas Historical Commission (THC) and the CAR, it included 41BX180, 41BX184, 41BX197,
41BX222, 41BX223, 41BX228, and 41BX996 (Potter and Black 1995). Some of the sites produced
complete yet mixed archaeological records of the Paleoindian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric periods
(Black and McGraw 1985). Some of the sites were revisited several times over the years and were
investigated most recently by the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) for the Wurzbach
Parkway Project (Black et al. 1998; Potter et al. 1995; Potter and Black 1995). The Panther Springs Creek
Site offered a substantial description of typological and distributional data over thousands of years of
occupation (Black and McGraw 1985).
Demonstrating long term occupation of the project area, two additional sites in the close vicinity include
41BX631 and 41BX1624. 41BX631 is adjacent to this project area and is a multi-component site. This
site appears to have been utilized as a short-term campsite from the Early Archaic through the Historic
Indian/ Spanish Colonial period (Bonine 2006). Artifacts recovered by Bob Burns (private collection) at
41BX631 include Martindale/Uvalde dart points, Nolan dart points, Perdanales dart points, Travis dart
point, Castroville dart point, Montell dart point, Ensor dart points, Scallorn points, Talco/Guerrero point,
and various other stone tools and a Spanish Colonial gunflint (Bonine 2006). T.R. Hester and Bob Burns
had originally recorded the site in 1984 (Hester 1984) and it was rerecorded in 1991 with a metal detector.
13

During the 1991 survey, historic artifacts including .57 caliber lead musket balls, two .69 caliber lead
musket balls, five Minie balls, .57 caliber musket balls hand mold, melted lead, and a high top percussion
cap. It was speculated that a temporary overnight camp may have occurred in this location during the
Civil War, due to the lack of structural or fire features. In 1995, Horizon reinvestigated the site and found
additional prehistoric and historic artifacts including various debitage and tools, and a Bulverde point
from the Early Archaic. Historic artifacts at 41BX631 included alkaline glazed crockery; however, no
metal artifacts were recorded during this investigation. An aggregation of limestone rock was suggested
as a potential feature and further work was recommended. Horizon returned in 2004 and a lanceolate
biface basal fragment and scattered lithic debris was recorded, however no subsurface materials were
recorded. SWCA revisited the site in 2006 and recorded a small scatter of lithic debitage, a scraper, a
core, and a small burned rock midden. SWCA also conducted a metal detector survey, but only one
artifact was potentially historic, a railroad spike and its date range is 1877 to present.
41BX1624 is a much smaller site that was also identified first by collectors and then revisited by
archaeologists prior to development. In 2005, David Calame recorded 41BX1624 on the north side of IH10. The location was provided by an informant and materials are held by the individual who discovered
them (Calame 2005). The materials included several dart points from the late archaic and a Spanish
Lance. These materials were located within a light lithic scatter. SWCA revisited the site in 2008 to
conduct intensive metal detecting and pedestrian survey prior to development in the area. One 19th
century machine made nail, one square cut nail, lithic debitage, and modern trash was recorded during
their revisit to the site. SWCA recommended that no further visits were necessary as site 41BX1624 is
heavily disturbed but that the Spanish Lance should be analyzed to add to the available information on
San Antonio area during the colonial period. Both site 41BX631 and site 41BX1624 demonstrate a clear
long term utilization of the Leon Creek water source from at least the Early Archaic time period through
to the historic period illustrating the importance of constant fresh water sources and the secondary
resources water provides with its presences, such as animal and plant life.

3.1

Archaeological Sites Associated with the Project Area

A review of the online THC Archeological Site Atlas indicates that at least 27 surveys have been
undertaken in a 1-mile buffer surrounding the Leon Creek Greenway project area. A moderate amount of
the project area has been surveyed, particularly the northern portion of the Leon Creek Greenway
Segment II, adjacent to The University of Texas San Antonio campus. The projects were a mix of area
and linear surveys, associated with road construction, university projects, and urban development. The
initial segment of this project was surveyed by the CAR in 2001 and consisted of a 3.75-mile (6.03kilometer) footpath. It spanned from Babcock Road, this project’s southern boundary, to the Bandera
Road crossing. No previously recorded sites exhibited remnants of cultural activity, and no new sites were
recorded during the CAR’s survey (Zapata and Weston 2002).
Thirty archaeological sites have been recorded within 1 mile of the project area, which is a high
probability locale given its proximity to the Leon Creek drainage system. The majority of sites are located
along terraces above Leon Creek that offer more level ground surface while still facilitating access to a
water source. These previously recorded sites consisted of twenty-six prehistoric sites, two historic sites,
and two multi-component sites.
Previously recorded sites within the immediate vicinity of the APE include 41BX48, 41BX53, 41BX72,
41BX232, 41BX233, and particularly sites 41BX52, 41BX40/47, and 41BX1064 which will be discussed
in more detail below (Figure 3-1). During the survey, sites 41BX48, 41BX53, 41BX72, 41BX127, and
41BX232 were all found to be destroyed. Sites 41BX53 and 41BX72 are presently within the heavily
developed and manicured landscapes within and around the Hill Country Place student apartment
complex. 41BX232 was likely destroyed during construction and landscape modification of UTSA Blvd,
which accommodates numerous large apartment complexes. Site 41BX233 was located although no
subsurface deposits were found.
The Pavo Real site (41BX52) along Leon Creek contained rare Clovis and Folsom components in limited,
undisturbed contexts (Collins et al. 2003; Henderson and Goode 1991). It was first identified by Bill
Fawcett and Paul McGuff (THC 2009). By mid 1979, excavations had commenced by the Texas
Department of Highways and Public Transportation (TDHPT). Investigations carried out by the TARL
reported data on the paleoenvironment and geomorphology of this locality as well. Out of four suites,
representing geological zones, two suites yielded significant cultural material. Suite III contained Clovis
and Folsom materials indicating a Paleo knapping area. Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dates
ranged from 7000 ± 250 BP and 2870 ± 300 BP (Collin et al. 2003). Suite IV, representing the Archaic
component of the site, yielded hearths, a burned rock midden, and numerous dart points. Radiocarbon
15

dates from the burned rock midden suggest usage from the Middle to Late Archaic (Black 2003).
Unfortunately, a great deal of Pavo Real has been impacted by development related to Loop 1604.
Between November 2006 and June 2007 investigations at site 41BX52 were conducted prior to
improvements along Loop 1604 were carried out by the Center for Archeological Research (CAR)
(Figueroa and Frederick 2008). This testing included coring, backhoe trenching and manual block
excavation to determine depth of construction fill and the presence, location, and if possible, condition of
an remnant archeological deposits.

Coring efforts could not penetrate the road fill but the block

excavation encountered Early Archaic diagnostic materials. These materials appeared within a ‘high
energy deposit’ that were most likely brought into the site by non-human means. During the investigation
in 2006 and 2007, Paleoindian materials were never encountered. CAR believes that some Suite III and
IV deposits may still exist in some areas and some small areas of Suite II (Paleoindian) deposits are
present but these deposits have undergone post-depositional disturbance (Figueroa and Frederick 2008).
CAR did not recommend any further work within their project area as the Early Archaic materials were
sparse and CAR had exhausted their research potential.
41BX47 is a large Archaic open campsite that rests within this project’s APE. 41BX47 was combined
with 41BX40 in a 1994 survey by the CAR and will continue to be identified as just 41BX47 for the sake
of simplicity. The first survey in this area recorded four archaeological sites including 41BX47, 41BX48,
and 41BX50 in 1970 by Paul McGuff and Bill Fawcett. 41BX48 and 41BX50 have been destroyed by
erosion and human activity.
Phase II work (1996) on site 41BX47 (and the now combined 41BX40) consisted of 14 1-x-1 meter test
units, 59 Gradall trenches, and numerous boring holes for geomorphologic purposes. Testing results
revealed 79 burned-rock features, 4,271 chipped stone artifacts, and 24 diagnostic projectile points
(Tennis 1996). Numerous archaeological sites in Central Texas have added to our understanding of
burned rock features, but 41BX47 was determined to be unique for several reasons. Feature density was
unusually high, the ratio of projectile point features was fairly low, and the ratio of ground stone
implements to projectile points was also considerably low (Hard and Bousman 1996). These ratios of
hearth use and projectile point discard may be related to diminishing bison populations during a period
when subsistence shifted to smaller game and plant processing (Hard and Bousman 1996).
Tennis et al. (1996) determined that the landscape encompassing site 41BX47 contained significant
cultural materials and features and Site 41BX47 “is eligible for inclusion in the National Register of
Historic Places under Criterion D because it has the potential to address important research issues relating
to Late Paleoindian, Early Archaic, and Middle Archaic prehistory in Central Texas” (J.E. Bruseth and
16

T.K. Perttula, Texas Historical Commission Officers, letter to W. Lea, Army Corps of Engineers,
November 6, 1995).

Historic Overview of the Project Area

This historic overview pertains to the area along Leon Creek in northern Bexar County that runs from the
vicinity of the modern-day intersection of IH-10 and Loop 1604 southwest to the creek’s intersection with
Prue Road. On the northernmost end of the project area, the creek flows through a 320-acre grant that was
surveyed in 1857 and patented to Samuel A. Maverick in 1861 (Texas. General Land Office 1861). In the
balance of the project area, the creek flows in a meandering fashion to the southwest through the upper
three quarters of the Anselmo (also spelled Enselmo) Pru (also spelled Prue) survey, a one-league grant
that was surveyed in 1838 and patented to William H. Steele and Ludovic Colquhoun in 1842 (Texas.
General Land Office 1842).
Pre-nineteenth-century records about the project area are scarce. McGraw (2009) has identified two
historic trails in the vicinity that moved human traffic and trade in and out of San Antonio de Bexar
during the eighteenth and first half of the nineteenth centuries before they became formal transportation
routes. The first of these, the Camino Pinta, led from San Antonio in a northerly direction through the
present-day Walker Ranch National Register Archaeological District, where the presence of a large
spring, dense concentration of prehistoric sites, and historic Indian ceramics testified to the persistent use
of the area prior to and on the eve of Spanish exploration and settlement. The district also included two
limestone obelisks that were horizontally and vertically scored. One stone face displayed the date 1786
and two brands, and the other displayed a cross; the style of the graffiti suggested associations with the
Spanish Colonial period.
According to McGraw, Camino Pinta generally followed US 87/10 from San Antonio through presentday Boerne to Fredericksburg, trending at certain places along Salado Creek in the vicinity of Camp
Bullis northeast of the project area. In the mid-nineteenth century, surveyors laying out grants east of
present-day IH-10 remarked on the existence of what they identified variously as the “old San Antonio
Fredericksburg Road (Pinta Trail)” and “Comanche Spr.-San Antonio Rd” (Figure 3-2).
McGraw identified a second colonial road to the west of Camino Pinta that was called Camino Viejo
(McGraw 2009). It generally paralleled the Camino Pinta and “led to the Spanish Colonial mission for the
Apache in modern Menard County.” Like many such trails, Camino Viejo varied in its location through
time. It was most frequently associated with the route of present-day Fredericksburg Road, and surveying
calls for the boundary of the Pru survey made in 1838 noted the existence of the “San Saba road” near
Fredericksburg Road, while an 1868 General Land Office map depicted a trail in the same area. A
General Land Office map compiled from a number of sources showed a branch of the road to the east side
of Fredericksburg Road, which then rejoined the main route several miles to the north (see Figure 3-2).
19

An early reference to landmarks associated with the Camino Viejo, the route in closest proximity to the
project area, appeared in Jean Louis Berlandier’s Journey to Mexico (Berlandier 1980:II:343-346).
Desiring to explore Texas west of San Antonio de Bexar, Berlandier, accompanied by Lt. Col. Jose
Francisco Ruiz, a party of dragoons, and a number of Comanche Indians, left the presidio in November
1828. The first night, the group camped approximately 3 leagues, or 9 miles, northwest of the presidio on
Olmos Creek, a location that would have placed the party about 1.5 miles north of the present-day
intersection of IH-10 and Loop 410. The following day, the party traveled “almost directly to the west, . .
. meandering considerably,” until they crossed Leon Creek. Reference to a modern map suggests that the
point of intersection may have been in the vicinity of 41BX1847. The party then “entered the gorges of
Puerto Viejo”1 about 3 miles from the Leon and continued on to Ojo de Agua.

1

Berlandier’s reference to the “gorges of Puerto Viejo” was to a landmark pass just north of the intersection of
present-day IH-10 and Loop 1604.
20

Figure 3-2. General Land Office map of Bexar County. A modern GLO map (1932) depicts
the location of historic trails such as the Pinta Trail, Camino Pinta, and a trail in the
vicinity of Fredericksburg Road across the east side of the Pru survey that was sometimes
referred to as the road to San Saba. Camino Viejo as depicted on Wilke's 1850 map (Figure
3-3) is projected on this map on the east side of Leon Creek in the Pru survey.

Berlandier’s exploration was followed within a decade by mapping associated with land granted by the
Republic of Texas. Several of the largest and oldest of these grants lay in the vicinity of the project area
along Leon and Olmos creeks (see Figure 3-2). Each encompassed about 1 league of land (4,428 acres);
among them were the Maria Trinidad Guerrera, Manuel Tejada, M. G. de los Santos, Jose Almeda, and
Anselmo Pru grants. The last one, bisected by Leon Creek and lying in a basin between hills to the south
and north, was named for Anselmo Pru, who demonstrated to the Board of Land Commissioners of Bexar
that he was a native of Texas who was married. The board issued Pru scrip, and like hundreds of other
residents of San Antonio for whom scrip was a close relative to money, he sold his first class certificate to
investors Ludovic Colquhoun and William H. Steele (Texas. General Land Office 1842).
Steele, a veteran of San Jacinto (Dixon and Kemp 1932:262), and Colquhoun, a future senator of the
Republic, Perote prisoner, and prosperous San Antonio merchant, were members with Sterling Niblett, A.
L. Addison, and C. Barrett in an association called the San Antonio Land Company. Formed in February
1837, the company intended to buy land in Texas from “Mexicans or other citizens” at a price not to
exceed $300 per league or per league and labor. The partners signed their formative agreement in New
Orleans and agreed to proceed immediately to Texas and begin purchasing certificates and locating land.
They would pay particular attention to factors such as “navigation to market, . . . quality of soil, water and
tim[b]er. . . .” with “sound discretion and an enlightened forecast,” the partners also would “endeavor to
secure the positions where the early and popular tide of im[m]igration may settle.” Practical tasks
included making surveys once the land certificates had been purchased from the original holders, and
recording and perfecting titles. The partners were to pay in $30,000 in capital stock (five shares at $6,000
each), and if any one of them failed to make payment, his share would be held for the benefit of the
company (District Court Case File 149).2
According to Colquhoun, Steele immediately left New Orleans for Texas, and Colquhoun followed soon
thereafter, assuming that he and Steele would work together to buy certificates (District Court Case File
149). San Antonio seemed a good place to undertake the acquisition of such paper, and in April 1837,
Steele and Colquhoun paid Anselmo Pru $1,000 for his certificate for a league and labor. Pru authorized
Steele and Colquhoun to locate the land to which he was entitled “anywhere in Texas,” and on February
1, 1838, John James, who was employed by Colquhoun prior to becoming the chief surveyor of Bexar
County, surveyed the approximately 4,428 acres on Leon Creek that became known as the Pru league.
Eighteen months later, Steele and Colquhoun proved to the Bexar County Board of Land Commissioners
that Pru was a married native of Texas who was entitled to a league and labor, and on February 8, 1842,

the land office issued a patent to the two men (Texas. General Land Office 1842).
Colquhoun subsequently maintained that Steele had not assisted with the work of buying land certificates,
nor had he put up any money on behalf of the San Antonio Land Company, which eventually acquired
about 70 grants. That did not stop Steele from attempted to sell his interest in the properties to James
Pinckney Henderson prior to his death in Matagorda, and so Colquhoun was forced to make a deal with
Henderson, who eventually assigned his interest to Colquhoun as a company agent (Deed Record D2:415-419; District Court Case File 149). With a clear title in hand, Colquhoun as an agent of the San
Antonio Land Company sold the Pru league to Charles Cocke of Albermarle County, Virginia, for $3,000
on January 12, 1847 (Deed Record E-2:23-28).3
Between 1847, when title to the survey was cleared, and the early 1850s, it is unlikely that any settlement
occurred on the Pru survey. A map published in 1850, and republished in 1851, illustrates a German call
for immigration to Texas, depicting the area from New Braunfels to San Antonio and Fredericksburg
(Figure 3-3). The cartographer (H. Willke) showed likely immigration routes and the outlines of some,
although not all, patented grants, including the Maria Trinidad Guerrera league southeast of the Pru
league, and the James B. Thompson grant that was transected by the “Camino Pintas.”
The outline of the Pru league did not appear on the map, but the route of the “Camin[o] Viejo” meandered
through its northern half on the east side of the Leon Creek before crossing to the west side of the creek
several miles north of the north line of the Pru league (see Figure 3-3) (Reimer 1851). Cocke held the Pru
survey intact until May 1, 1851, when he sold the north one-third of the league (1,476 acres) to Joseph B.
Anderson of Amelia County, Virginia (Deed Record K-1:450). Six years later, he sold an additional 800
acres immediately south of the land sold to Anderson to R. P. Maclay for $1,200 (Deed Record 1:538539). He made the sale through his San Antonio agent, James L. Trueheart, with whom he made a moreformal arrangement in October of 1857. According to the agreement, Trueheart was to act as Cocke’s
agent by paying taxes on the land that Cocke still owned (land that then included the south half of the Pru
league) and selling it if such sales were advantageous. Tellingly, Trueheart also was empowered to
preserve the land from all encumbrances, “particularly that from illegal settlers or depredations. . .” (Deed
Record K:615). In the latter half of the 1850’s, illegal settlement may not have been particularly
troublesome. But the record drought that drove settlers away and threatened to depopulate San Antonio
and the Hill Country west of it led desperate Indians to press eastward, and depredations were violent and
frequent.
3

A subsequent deed (Deed Record K-1:450; K-2:615) indicated that Cocke also was a member of the San Antonio
Land Company by the late 1840s, and that Colquhoun’s conveyance of the Pru survey to him was part of a division
of the land that belonged to the company.

Figure 3-3. H. Wilke’s map depicting roads between New Braunfels, San Antonio, and
Fredericksburg in 1850. Wilke’s 1850 map (Resmier 1851) depicted the Camina Pintas and
Camin[o] Viejo as they led north out of San Antonio. The Camino Viejo followed the east side of
Leon Creek in the vicinity of the Pru survey, which is not delineated on the map.

By 1860, settlers moved into the area bordering the Pru survey, favoring land to the north and east. The
1860 census (listing a post office at Leon Springs) suggested that the population was sparse, ethnically
mixed, and ready to take advantage of open ranges. Families included those of Joseph Huebner, a stock
raiser from Austria; Johann Moos, a farmer from Germany; Thomas Scott, a farmer from Illinois; W. J.
Locke, a stock raiser from Illinois; S. Coker from South Carolina; William M. Bacon, a farmer from
Maine; and Juan B. Urrutia, a farmer born in Texas. Two families who were related were those of
Thomas L. Odom4 and M. Gillis, whose wife, Almira, was Odom’s sister. The Odoms, from Alabama,
had lived first on the Medina River in Bandera County, but Odom began to buy land in the vicinity of
northern Bexar County in the mid-to-late 1850s. He was joined by his sister’s family in about 1859, and
the two families lived near one another. Between them, they listed ownership of 400 cattle, 150 sheep,
and 8 horses, a number far exceeding the capacity of the 200 acres they owned, suggesting that they relied
heavily on an open range. That range, the sparseness of population, and their locations near traditional
Indian travel ways such as the Camino Viejo, also made the early settlers vulnerable to attack: Odom’s
neighbor noted about Odom that he “seemed to live right at the Indian door. . . . Whenever they would
come through that country they were sure to strike him; get him every time” (Freeman 2001:95).
Settlement in the northern half of the Pru survey appears to have remained non-existent during the 1860s
and through the early 1870s, in large part because it was owned by out-of-state investors. In addition, the
800 acres that R. P. Maclay had bought in 1857 had become the focus of a lawsuit after Maclay failed to
pay off a note and the note holders in Louisiana filed suit against him. They prevailed, and the Bexar
County sheriff seized the 800 acres and sold them to James Trueheart at a public auction in June 1869
(Journal District Courts G:123, 175; Deed Record U-2:537; United States. Federal District Court Case
3940). By the time the two men settled the case in federal court in 1882, Trueheart apparently had sold off
much of the 800 acres, one sale along Fredericksburg Road being to W. G. Kingsbury and another along
Leon Creek being to Augustine (also spelled Augustin) de Zavala (Deed Record 1:100-101), the son of
Lorenzo de Zavala and father of Adina de Zavala. Settlement of the suit left Maclay with only 277 ½
acres, the western part of which became the location of Site 41BX1812.
The 1,476 acres to the north that had been owned intact by Joseph B. Anderson since 1851 passed from
the Anderson family in April 1872, when Anderson’s widow, Jane, sold the land to John (Johann) Moos.
Moos was a 47-year-old German immigrant who had entered Texas with his parents and two brothers in
1845. The family may have been members of the Fisher-Miller Colony, and they received certificates for
land on the San Saba River in 1847. John Moos married Rosina Anding, fellow German immigrant
4

The Odoms eventually trailed cattle from San Antonio to Kansas in the early-to-mid 1870s, and in 1877 they
bought the nucleus of what became the Fort Chadbourne Ranch in Coke County (Freeman 2001:95).
25

(Pfeiffer n.d.), and, according to Stone and Stone (n.d.), settled at Leon Creek in about 1850, receiving a
160-acre pre-emption grant in about 1855.5 In actuality, as late as 1871, the Moos family was living on
120 improved acres in the Locke survey immediately east of the Pru survey, where they had a small herd
of horses and 100 cattle (Texas. Bexar County 1871). Six years later, the county laid out a new route for
the Fredericksburg Road (Locke 1877), which ran slightly west of the old route through the eastern edge
of the Pru survey (Figure 3-4). Sites of settlement along the old road as depicted on the map included
“Moos’ old place”; the improvements of S. Coker, L. M. Lacey, J. Bacon, and Mrs. Bacon; “Moos’ new
place” adjacent to the new Fredericksburg Road and in the northeast corner of the Pru survey;6 and the
improvements of Drowns and Mrs. Bacon on adjoining surveys to the north and east.
The following year, the county laid out the Pecan Springs Road east of Fredericksburg Road (Lucas
1878). Development of such roads by the county, settlement of lawsuits concerning the Pru league, and
gradual easing of Indian attacks may have been responsible for the increase in settlement on the Pru and
surrounding grants that was reflected in tax records:

in 1875, resident taxpayers in the area of

Fredericksburg Road and Leon Creek included members of the Bacon, Lucey, Coker, Igo, Jessey, Moos,
Garza, and Schmidt families. By 1880, the list included members of the Scott, Taft, Lynn, Proudy,
McBritney [?], Taylor, Murgatroyd, Garza, Solis, Bennett, and de Zavala families (United States 1880).
Augustine de Zavala, who lived in the central part of the Pru survey, served as the community’s
postmaster, distributing mail from the Locke Hill Post Office that was located at the Shavano School (San
Antonio Express News, June 8, 1997:Images:8).

Stone and Stone apparently were unaware that the Moos House was located on the Pru league. Cox (Tennis and
Hard 1995:3) erroneously placed the Moos house on Survey 21, immediately north of the Pru Survey.
6
“Moos’ new place” still stands within the Gunn Honda dealership. The structure was designated a City of San
Antonio landmark and a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark based on the erroneous assumption that it was “Moos’
old place,” which was located to the south-southeast.

Moos family.

John Moos died in about 1881, leaving six children and a widow, Rosina, who acquired some additional
property in the area subsequently. She kept the ranch intact, living in the two-story stone house in the
northeast quadrant of the Pru survey east of Leon Creek. Her neighbors to the south and east were Abbie
K. Gillis Bacon (daughter of the M. and Almira Odom Gillises who had moved to the area in the late
1850s) and Abbie’s husband, John C. Bacon, who probably was related to the William M. Bacon who
appeared in the neighborhood on the 1860 census. The Bacons, using Abbie’s independent means, had
begun to buy up land on the Pru and nearby surveys by the early 1880s, including the future site of
41BX1812 from R. P. Maclay, acreage on the Locke survey, and improved land on the Hawkins survey.
By 1890, Abbie Bacon had assembled a 1,286-acre ranch on both sides of Leon Creek, 1,139 acres of it in
the Pru survey directly south of the Moos Ranch. There, she and her husband raised horses and cattle, as
their neighbors also did.
Ownership in the area appears to have remained relatively stable until the early twentieth century, in large
part because Fredericksburg Road facilitated north-south-bound traffic, but a lack of east-west corridors,
together with the presence of two large ranches, impeded the sale and development of smaller parcels.
Ownership of the Moos Ranch remained constant, the property being acquired by Rosina and John’s two
sons, John and Henry Moos, in 1905 (Deed Record 245:10). In 1913, Henry bought out John’s interest so
that ownership was consolidated once again (Deed Record 409:9-103) and remained constant until Henry
Moos’s death in the late 1940s. The Bacon Ranch remained similarly intact, with the exception of a sale
of about 300 acres prior to 1900; and the de Zavala Ranch south of the Bacons and bordering Leon Creek
passed to a member of that family (Julia de Zavala) by 1912 (Appler 1912). However, John Bacon died in
about 1906, and Abbie Bacon died in January 1915, leaving five surviving children, only four of whom
were named as heirs (Deed Record 476:425; Probate File No. 7481). By February 1916, the heirs had
divided the ranch, Mollie Bacon Kneuff and Lillian Bacon receiving the land in the Pru survey, and the
two sons, John M. and Walter C. Bacon, receiving the part of the ranch on the east side of Fredericksburg
Road (Deed Record 477:45-50).
The division of the Bacon Ranch, together with the construction of Hausman Road,7 which ran west from
Fredericksburg Road across Leon Creek to Babcock Road, meant that it was only a matter of time before
the portion of the Bacon Ranch on the Pru survey slipped from the family’s ownership. Henry Moos
bought a part of the land bordering his ranch on the south (Deed Record 509:522-523), and Lillian Bacon
sold 130 acres on the creek to the brother who had received nothing from the estate (Deed Record
7

Official road maps of Bexar County dated 1921 and 1924 depicted a continuous line of gravel deposits along the
left bank of Leon Creek from Fredericksburg to Hausman roads. These deposits may have been used in the
construction of Hausman and other county roads during World War I and later ([Clarke] 1924; Texas State Highway
Department 1921).
28

509:535-536). By the early 1920s, a landscape that had been comprised of relatively large acreages began
a process of subdivision when sales of parcels as small as 35 acres occurred (Deed Record 654:611-612).
A map constructed in the late 1920s showed numerous improvements on the Pru survey south and west of
the Moos Ranch (Figure 3-5). Common names, some of which had been associated with nineteenthcentury settlers in the area, included Gerfers, Igo, Hausman, Arnold, Jones, Benke, Wehmeyer, Woller,
Peterson, Schmidt, and Linn, suggesting a certain stability to the local population.
Despite early signs of change in the 1920s, the project area appears to have remained largely rural for
another 50 years. A county map dating to the early 1930s, for example (Figure 3-6), depicted a cultural
landscape much like that of the late 1920s. Indeed, the area remained stable, even after the death of Henry
Moos and sale of his ranch to San Antonio developers George Delavan and R. R. Baines in 1951 (Deed
Record 3057:512-514). In 1953, a USGS quadrangle depicting the eastern two-thirds of the Pru survey
showed the improvements associated with the Moos family home, scattered buildings near the
intersection of Hausman and Fredericksburg roads, on the south side of Hausman Road, and in the
vicinity of de Zavala Road, particularly near Leon Creek. Even the construction of US Highway 87 in the
late 1950s failed to change the essentially static character of the landscape.
By 1973, however, when the first phase of construction at the new UTSA campus was completed,
Oakland Estates appeared on the south border of the Pru survey, and another new subdivision appeared
north of the survey and Loop 1604. Twenty years later, subdivisions had spread north from de Zavala
Road, leaving the area in the vicinity of Hausman Road near Leon Creek one of the few remnant rural
landscapes.

Field and Laboratory Methods

4.1

Field Methodology

The archaeological investigation of the Leon Creek Greenway Segment II project area consisted of
intensive reconnaissance walk-over surveys and systematic shovel testing. The entire project area was
subjected to a pedestrian walkover survey, where the ground surface and creek cutbanks were examined
for cultural material and features. Minimum survey standards set by the THC require a density of 2 shovel
tests per acre. Linear shovel testing along the hike and bike trail, in addition to all of its branches/arms,
occurred at 30-meter intervals. Large easement parcels of landscape existed adjacent to the linear trail
network, and in addition to intensive reconnaissance survey, these easement parcels were also in some
cases subject to random shovel testing. GPS coordinates were captured for all 153 shovel tests during the
course of this project.
Shovel tests measured 30-cm in diameter and extended to a maximum depth of 80 centimeters below
surface (cmbs), unless otherwise prevented by shallow soils and limestone outcroppings (Figure 4-1). The
shovel tests were excavated in 10-centimeter increments and all soil was screened through a ¼-inch
hardware cloth (Figure 4-2). When cultural material was recovered from a shovel test, the shovel test was
delineated at 10-meter intervals until two negative shovel tests in every cardinal direction were attained,
or until a project area boundary or physical hindrance was encountered. Relevant information was
recorded on a standardized form. All collected material was brought back to aci consulting facilities for
analysis. The material will be curated at University of Texas-San Antonio, Center for Archaeological
Research (UTSA CAR).
During the recording and revisiting of sites throughout the course of this project, the establishment of site
boundaries adhered to several different methodologies. If a new site was to be recorded, and limestone
outcroppings were visible on the surface with little to no soil accretion, thus precluding shovel testing,
then site boundaries were established by the distribution of artifacts on the ground surface. If a site
already recorded was revisited, then boundaries established by the original researcher were reestablished
and confirmed. During the course of this project, no archaeological site datums within previously
recorded sites were found, and therefore new datums were set and GPS coordinates were captured for
entry into the THC Archeological Site Atlas. Smaller sites were mapped with compass and pacing
methods, and larger sites were mapped with GPS linear functions.

For the purposes of this survey, an archaeological site had to contain a certain number of cultural
materials or features older than 50 years within a given area. The definition of a site is: (1) five or more
surface artifacts within a 15-meter radius (ca. 706.9 m sq.), or (2) a single cultural feature, such as a
hearth or burned rock midden, observed on the surface or exposed during shovel testing, or (3) a positive
shovel test containing at least five total artifacts, or (5) two positive shovel tests located within 30 meters
of each other.
In several instances during the site mapping process, natural landscape features, such as the position of
the creek or a creek branch, or a sharp slope between a floodplain and a terrace, were utilized as natural
site boundaries. Such landscape features could also halt shovel test delineation in a specific cardinal
direction. If construction/development disturbances or considerable landscape slopes were encountered
during shovel testing, then they were plotted with GPS linear functions.
The entire project area was subject to an intensive pedestrian survey where the entire ground surface was
thoroughly inspected, and the APE received 153 shovel tests (Figure 4-3, Frames 1 and 2).
Archaeological field work resulted in the discovery and documentation of three new sites, and the
revisiting and reassessment of nine previously recorded sites (Figure 4-4). It became clear during this
investigation that the majority of the project area exhibits evidence of a long history of dumping,
mechanical landscape modification, flash flooding, and recreational activities including mountain biking
and hunting.

Archival Research Strategies

Archival work for the project focused on two separate tasks: investigation of the history of a complex of
standing structures (41BX1812) and two isolated finds (a single large stone and one-half of a tombstone),
and contextual research about the historical development of the area along Leon Creek from the vicinity
of Loop 1604 southwest to Prue Road.
Research began in the Information Systems division of the General Land Office where GIS personnel
provided the historian with an overlay of historic grants on a compiled USGS topographical map provided
by aci. This information was used to identify grants that were located in the vicinity of the project area
and to guide subsequent legal research. Pertinent grant files were examined at the General Land Office,
and abstracts of title were prepared that were based on records held at the Bexar County Courthouse and
County Records Center. Information gathered from legal documents was used to target appropriate
primary and secondary sources at The University of Texas at San Antonio Archives and Special
Collections (legal abstracts), Daughters of the Republic of Texas Library at the Alamo (vertical files,
books, and maps), San Antonio Public Library, Texana-Genealogy Collection (vertical files; maps; books;
death certificates; and newspaper, census, and tax records on microfilm), Fort Sam Houston National
Cemetery (burial inventories), and Bexar County Public Works (maps). Supplemental research occurred
at the Center for American History at The University of Texas at Austin and the National Archives and
Records Administration-Fort Worth, which supplied a copy of a federal court file that pertained to the
project area. Conversations with Al McGraw at the Texas Department of Transportation focused on
documentation of historic trails and roads in the vicinity of the project area.
In the field, the historian worked with an aci staff archaeologist to identify and record components of Site
41BX1812. Each component was photographed, the locations entered into a GPS unit, and the exteriors
of six standing buildings measured. The historian also visited and photographed the two isolated finds.
Descendants of the apparent builder of Site 41BX1812 were identified and contacted, but they declined to
assist with the research effort.

Archaeological Laboratory Methods

All cultural materials and records obtained and/or generated during the project were prepared in
accordance with federal regulation 36 CFR part 79, and THC requirements for State Held-in-Trust
collections. Additionally, the materials were curated in accordance with current guidelines of aci
consulting. Artifacts processed by aci consulting were washed, air-dried, and stored in 4-mm zip locking
archival-quality bags. Acid-free labels were placed in all artifact bags. Each label contained provenience
information and a corresponding lot number written in archival ink, with pencil or laser printed. Tools
were labeled with permanent ink over a clear coat of acrylic and covered by another acrylic coat. In
addition, a small sample of unmodified debitage from each lot was labeled with the appropriate
provenience data. Artifacts were separated by class and stored in acid-free boxes. Digital photographs
were printed on acid-free paper, labeled with archival-quality materials, and placed in archival-quality
sleeves. All field forms were completed with pencil. Upon completion of the project, all collected
materials will be housed at UTSA’s CAR.

Newly Recorded Site Results

The following site descriptions are of sites discovered during this project’s archaeological survey work
that were not registered in the THC Archeological Site Atlas (2009). They include two small prehistoric
sites and a historic farmstead (see Figure 4-4).

5.1

41BX1810

41BX1810 is an Early Archaic campsite that rests on a bluff overlooking the east bank of Leon Creek
(Figures 5-1 and 5-2). The site is in a convenient location in proximity to a water source that at one time
flowed more productively. Numerous limestone outcroppings are scattered about the landscape, and little
soil accretion has taken place at this specific locality. Due to the shallow soils, the site boundaries are
defined by a steep ledge that slopes down to the creek, and by the distribution of artifacts on the ground
surface. All cultural material was collected from the surface, and consisted of a Nolan projectile point and
18 pieces of lithic debitage. The site was mapped and a datum was set. This specific area has been subject
to a great deal of mountain biking, and significant public collecting has more than likely taken place.

Approximately 18 specimens of debitage and one tool were recovered from the ground surface of
41BX1810 within a very confined area. It has been suggested that surface artifact density is often the
result of post-depositional processes and that observed variations of artifact types may have more
explanatory power than absolute counts (Lewarch and O’Brien 1981; Redman and Watson 1970; Redman
1987). However, variation in artifact categories during this project was fairly limited. Since all artifacts
from 41BX1810 were collected off of the surface, a more in-depth debitage analysis was not performed,
and only basic attributes are described. Debitage cortex is an indicator of the reduction process, and it is
generally assumed that the amount of cortex on a late reduction specimen is less than early reduction
flakes. Table 5-1 suggests that the high number of tertiary flakes may reflect activities pertaining to tool
rejuvenation and other late stages of raw material reduction.

The landscape at 41BX1810 exhibited limestone outcrops and very shallow soils. Artifacts yielded from
the ground surface of 41BX1810 included debitage and a single Nolan projectile point. This style is an
Early Archaic trend (Turner and Hester 1999), and this specimen is mostly intact (see Figure 5-3). It
exhibits moderate basal thinning, and one edge has been subject to intensive lateral edge trimming during
the removal of a step plateau that is still visible. This point was probably abandoned following a knapping
error made during the retouch of an impact fracture.

Recommendation
41BX1810 was discovered on the east bank of Leon Creek where the trail is proposed to cross the creek.
This locality falls between Hausman and Babcock Roads. It was an Early Archaic campsite that yielded a
Nolan projectile point and lithic debitage. The site was mapped and a datum was set. Little soil deposition
is found in this locality, and all cultural material on the ground surface was collected. Soils are clearly
shallow, and research value at this site is limited. All cultural material on the surface of this site has been
collected. Site 41BX1810 is recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP or listing as a SAL
due to the paucity of artifacts, lack of intact deposits, and inability to provide additional useful
information to the prehistory of the region.

41BX1811

41BX1811 is a prehistoric site of unknown age that is situated on a bluff overlooking the opposite bank of
Leon Creek from 41BX1811 (Figures 5-4 and 5-5). This site is also located in proximity to a once
productive water source. Artifacts consisted of debitage, a thick biface, and numerous pieces of FCR.
Two shovel tests were excavated to negative results, and all artifacts rested on the surface. Site boundaries
were defined by a steep ledge sloping east towards Leon Creek, and the distribution of cultural material
on the surface. Debitage and the biface were collected. 41BX1811 was mapped and a site datum was set.
This location has also been subject to a great deal of mountain biking, and public collecting has likely
affected artifact distributions on the surface.
Cultural material from this site was recovered from the surface. Undisturbed soil deposition was observed
in this area, but shovel testing did not reveal subsurface cultural deposits. Artifacts collected from
41BX1811 consisted of lithic debitage and a single biface. The thick biface appears to be an expedient
tool. It is complete but not heavily worked. Of the 28 flakes that were collected, 22 non-corticated
specimens indicate later stages of lithic reduction as seen below.

Table 5-2. Artifact inventory and attributes for 41BX1811.
This site exhibited numerous specimens of FCR on the surface of the landscape. Specimens were small
and no dense distributions were observed. Site 41BX1811, like 41BX1810, is located on a substantially
high bluff overlooking Leon Creek. Both locations would provide safe elevations from flash flooding
episodes, while facilitating ease of access to water and chert cobbles within the creek bed.

Recommendation
41BX1811 was revealed during archaeological survey and recorded. It is a prehistoric campsite of
undetermined age. It was shovel tested to negative results. However, FCR was scattered across its surface.
Lithic debitage and a biface were collected. This site also rests on a bluff overlooking the west bank of
Leon Creek. With the exception of FCR, all artifacts from 41BX1811 were collected. The site holds little
research potential and provides no additional information to benefit the prehistory of the region. Site
41BX1811 is recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP or listing as a SAL due to the paucity
of artifacts, lack of intact deposits, and inability to provide additional useful information to the prehistory
of the region.

41BX1812

Site 41BX1812 is an early twentieth-century farmstead comprised of buildings and landscape features.
The complex, which includes six standing buildings, is located on a terrace above Leon Creek and
organized in a roughly linear fashion from north to south (Figure 5-6). The remnants of a dirt two-track
road meander south from the gate and lead to the building complex, giving access to the main and
secondary residences and to a barn.
Structures on-site include the following as numbered on Figure 5-6:
•

A one-story, frame, board-and-batten main residence (Feature 4) with a steeply pitched gable
roof, a single-vehicle attached garage on the north façade, and a one-room frame addition with a
shallow-pitched roof on the south façade (Figures 5-7 and 5-8). The original roofing material,
wood shingles, has been covered by corrugated metal panels, most of which have been removed
or have blown off. A distinctive stone chimney is located on the west façade of the frame addition
and displays architectural characteristics of 1920s-1930s construction. The body of the house,
which is comprised of six original rooms and a hall, has a verticality that suggests a pre-World
War I construction date, as do the one-over-one wood frame windows. However, the pairing of
the windows suggests a slightly later construction date, while the existence of a variety of
construction materials, including beaded boards in some ceilings, suggests the re-use of materials
from other, older structures.

•

Duplex workers’ housing (Feature 19) consisting of a one-story, two-room frame structure with a
shed room behind each of the main rooms, a porch on the north façade, and a porch-hot water
heater room on the southwest façade (Figure 5-9). Each main room has an entrance from the front
porch; there is no door between the rooms. A wood shingle roof is covered by corrugated metal.

•

A two-story barn (Feature 20) with gambrel roof in the New England style, a structural system
consisting of upright wood posts, and exterior sheathing of vertically and horizontally attached
corrugated metal (Figures 5-10 and 5-11). A second-story floor creates a space for storage of hay
and other feed. Pickets are attached to the exterior wood columns and serve to partially enclose
the first-floor space.

•

A one-story, two-room frame building (Feature 14) with corrugated metal roof and cement floor
(Figure 5-12). This structure may have served as a milk house or shop. One room is enclosed; the
second has metal screening on the south façade and a separate entrance.

•

A gable-roofed, metal-sided building (Feature 16) that is located adjacent to the milk house on the
south; the structure is open on the east end (Figure 5-13). It appears to have been used to house
equipment such as a tractor.

•

A combination water well (Feature 15) and well house with ruinous platform for a wooden water
tank (Feature 17) (Figure 5-14). This complex is located west of the equipment shed. Windmill
parts have been removed from the site and re-deposited south of the dairy barn. The well house
has a concrete floor, and some electrical equipment remains. The wooden water tank that once
stood on the metal reinforced roof of the well house has collapsed, leaving the staves and metal
rings in-place or scattered on the ground around the well house.
Site features are numerous and include:

•

A septic system (Feature 6) and buried propane tank (Feature 7) between the main house and yard
fence.

•

Stone and concrete walkways (Features 5, 8, and 12) between the main house and yard fence and
between the south entrance to the residence and a stone pond (Feature 9) (see Figure 5-8) in the
center of the front yard.

•

Fencing delineating property lines, yards, and roadways (Features 10, 18).

•

An internal road system.

•

A metal clothesline (Feature 21).

•

Feature probably associated with a demolished wash room and drainage system (Feature 22).

•

A retaining wall (Feature 23) on the west side of the building complex.

•

Sporadic plantings of yucca and other native plants, delineated by stone alignments (Feature 3)
and located along the west side of the dirt road that leads from Hausman Road to the farmstead
complex.

Site History
Present-day 41BX1812 is located south of Hausman Road and east of Leon Creek. It is on an
approximately 34.8-acre tract that is located in the western portion of the Anselmo Pru league (see Figure
3-2). Pru demonstrated to the Board of Land Commissioners of Bexar that he was entitled to a league and
labor of land because he was a married man who was a native of Texas. On April 11, 1837, he sold his
certificate to Ludovic Colquhoun and William H. Steele (Texas. General Land Office 1842), partners in
an association called the San Antonio Land Company that had been formed early in 1837. On May 22,
1838, Steele sold his interest in 37 leagues and labors and 20 thirds of a league [sic] for which patents had
not yet been obtained, and some of which had not yet been located, to James Pinckney Henderson for
$2,000. The next year, Henderson transferred his interest in the assets of the San Antonio Land Company
back to the company (Deed Record D-2:415-419) in exchange for several grants, and soon after, a league
was surveyed in the names of Colquhoun and Steele as assignees of Pru. The survey, which was
completed on February 1, 1838, embraced 14 labors of arable and 12 labors of pasture land. Leon Creek
ran through the western portion of the league, and the surveyor’s calls noted the presence of what was
then called the San Saba Road running diagonally through the northeastern corner of the league.
Colquhoun owned the league on Leon Creek (together with a labor in Pru’s name that had been surveyed
on Balcones Creek to the north) until January 12, 1847. He then, with his wife Frances A. W. Colquhoun,
sold that property and a number of other sizeable tracts in Bexar and San Patricio counties to Charles
Cocke, a physician and member of the Virginia Senate from Albemarle County, Virginia, for $3,000, on
January 12, 1847 (Deed Record E-2:23-28; Tyler 1915:436). A subsequent deed indicated that he made
the sale as an agent of the San Antonio Land Company and that Cocke was a member of the association
as well (Deed Record K-1:459).
On May 1, 1851, Cocke deeded one-third of the lands allotted to him as a member of the company to
Joseph B. Anderson, a physician and slaveholder in Amelia County, Virginia, who had served in the War
of 1812. Specifically, the land embraced the north one-third of the Pru league, a tract that lay north of Site
41BX1812 (Anonymous 1905:32; Deed Record K-1:450). He then appointed James Trueheart to act as
his lawful attorney. He also empowered to Trueheart to dispose of the land in a way that would be
favorable to Cocke (Deed Record K-2:615).
In March 1857, Cocke, through Trueheart, sold a tract of land to R. P. Maclay for $1,200. The acreage
was not specified in the deed, but a subsequent deed indicated that the tract embraced 800 acres. The tract
lay immediately south of the one-third league sold to Anderson in 1851, and Leon Creek formed its
western boundary (Deed Record U-2:537; 1:538-539). It included the locations of Site 41BX1812 and
57

Isolated Finds 1 and 2.
Maclay apparently suffered financial losses during the Civil War, and in 1866 he gave a note for
$1,700.60 to a firm in New Orleans named Longstreet Owens & Co. When Maclay failed to pay the note,
Owens Brothers filed a suit, which they won, and the sheriff seized the 800 acres. He sold the land in June
1869, and it was purchased by James Trueheart (Deed Record U-2:537; Journal District Courts G:123,
175).
Sometime after 1869, Maclay field a suit against Trueheart to try and recover some part of the 800 acres.
The case was a drawn out one, and it was not until October 1882 that the two parties came to an
agreement that left Maclay with a tract encompassing 277½ acres on Leon Creek (Deed Record 1:100101). He then sold the entire acreage to Abbie K. Bacon in 1883 for $1,200 that was paid out of her
separate estate (Deed Record 27:509-510).
Abbie Keziah Bacon (1852-1915) was the matriarch of a large family of ranchers in Bexar County. Her
parents were M. and Almira (Odom) Gillis, who had moved to Texas from Alabama in about 1860. They
apparently followed Almira’s brother, T. L. Odom, and his family, who had immigrated to Texas in 1854.
The two families settled in the vicinity of the Pru league in the area of the Leon Springs post office, where
they listed their occupations as stock raisers. By 1860, Gillis owned 100 improved acres and property in
San Antonio. He was raising sheep, while his brother-in-law owned real estate worth $1,000 (Texas.
Bexar County 1860; United States 1860).
By 1870, Elmira Gillis had moved into San Antonio, where she lived with her children, including 19year-old Abbie, while M. Gillis continued to raise a large herd of cattle (1,220 in 1871) on almost 800
acres of land northeast of the Pru league (Texas. Bexar County 1871; United States 1870). In September
1873, Abbie married John C. Bacon (Marriage Records E:540), who had been raising horses by the early
1870s (Texas. Bexar County 1871), and she began to buy land almost immediately. By 1875, her husband
was taxed for land in the Locke, Hawkins, and Pru surveys and had a large herd of horses (150 animals)
(Texas. Bexar County 1875). That same year, Abbie bought a total of 161 acres in the Pru survey (Deed
Record 1:405; 4:207), and in 1876 she purchased an additional 195 acres in the Pru survey. By 1880,
when Abbie and John Bacon appear to have been living on the Hawkins survey northeast of the Pru
survey, she was paying taxes on a total of 836 acres, 20 horses or mules, 10 cattle, and 500 sheep (Texas.
Bexar County 1875). Two years later, she had purchased another 440 acres in the Pru survey bordering on
the west side of Leon Creek (Deed Record 12:538), and by 1890, her real estate holdings totaled 1,139
acres in the Pru survey, 126.67 acres in the Locke survey, and 20.55 acres in the Wrede survey, all of it
apparently improved.
58

On June 19, 1905, John Bacon acknowledged that Abbie had paid for the ranch where he lived with
separate funds, and so the approximately 1,150 acres on both sides of Fredericksburg Road were actually
her separate estate (Deed Record 259:15-17). John Bacon died soon after, and Abbie, who was then living
in San Antonio with a daughter, died on January 28, 1915 (Probate File No. 7481; San Antonio Express,
January 29, 1915:10). She left an estate of more than 1,000 acres, the greatest part of it in the Pru survey,
and city property. Her heirs were sons John M. Bacon and Walter C. Bacon and daughters Mattie E.
Knauff and Lillian B. Bacon (Probate File No. 7481).
The ranch property passed to the four children in undivided interests, and they decided to partition the
acreage. The two sons received five parcels on the east side of Fredericksburg Road, about half of it being
in the Pru survey. Mattie Knauff received 195 acres on the north side of the newly laid out Hausman Road
that abutted Fredericksburg Road on the east and touched Leon Creek on the west. Lillian Bacon
received two parcels. The first, 130 acres on the south side of Hausman Road, adjoined Leon Creek (Deed
Record 477:45-50) and embraced the area associated with 41BX1812. The second, approximately 190
acres on the north side of Hausman Road, lay on both sides of Leon Creek and embraced the area
associated with Isolated Finds 1 and 2 (Figure 5-15).
Lillian Bacon owned the 130-acre tract on which 41BX1812 is located from February 8, 1916, to May 29,
1917, when she sold it to J. V. Bacon for $1,950 (Deed Record 509:535-536), a sum that suggests that the
property was unimproved, or only minimally improved. The purchaser, Joe Bacon, was a brother of the
four heirs of Abbie Bacon. He was not acknowledged by Bacon in her will, and the 1900 census
incorrectly identified him as a 9-year-old daughter named Josie Bacon, then living with parents John and
Abbie K., and siblings John M., Mattie, Lillie, and Walter. By 1910, Walter and Joe had moved away and
were living together.8

Abbie Bacon’s obituary (San Antonio Express, January 29, 1915:10) listed her children as Mrs. George Knauff;
Miss Lillie Bacon; and John, Walter, and Joe Bacon. Walter Bacon’s obituary in 1956 referred to his brother, Joe V.
Bacon.
59

Figure 5-15. Partition map of land owned by Abbie Bacon estate, 1916. Figure is taken from Deed
Record 477:50.
It is likely that Joe V. Bacon, by then married to Tea Ora Bacon, constructed the house and some
improvements at 41BX1812 after his May 1917 purchase of the surrounding 130 acres. The 1920 federal
census indicated that his household was one of approximately four along Hausman Road, and that he was
engaged in general farming. Members of his household were his wife, a 2-year-old daughter, and two
young men who were helping Bacon with his farming endeavors. One was C. L. Garner; the second was
Ed Igo who probably was related to the Igo family that were early settlers along Fredericksburg Road.
The Bacons held the 130 acres intact until August 14, 1921, when they sold approximately 35 acres
encompassing Site 41BX1812 to Allie Belle Horton Baker. Baker paid $3,500 for the tract (Deed Record
509:535-536), a significant increase per acre over the 1917 price. Baker appears to have purchased the
property for investment purposes: she was a resident of San Antonio when she turned the property over
to agents early in 1922. One contract of sale received on February 2 described her property on Hausman
Road as being 35 acres with improvements of a “dwelling, well, windmill[,] gasoline engine[,] milkhouse,
dairy barn, etc.” (Deed Record 664:640-641).
On March 13, 1922, Baker sold the 35 acre dairy farm to J. W. Vasbinder for $600 cash and Vasbinder’s
assumption of two notes (Deed Record 671:520-521). Two years later, Vasbinder sold the property to J.
A. Richardson (Deed Record 764:55-56), who conveyed the property to E. F. Hunter by July 1925 (Deed
Record 764:55-56; 1063:388-389). Hunter’s purchase occurred at a difficult time for agriculture in Bexar
60

County, when a severe drought in the mid-1920s devastated crops and other agricultural endeavors
dependent on water. By 1928, Hunter had defaulted on a note, and in 1929, the note holders, Second
Mortgage Bond Company, filed suit against Hunter. The company won the suit and recovered title to the
35 acres, which it then sold to Victor Friedrichs for $3,500 in cash and notes on April 4, 1930 (Deed of
Trust 1115:337-338; Deed Record 1123:368-369; 1163:160-161; 1175:317-318).
Friedrichs, a partner in the San Antonio engineering firm of Mills, Friedrichs & Wise, with offices in the
newly opened Milam Building, owned the 35 acres on Leon Creek for 8 years. During the early 1930s, he
appears to have lived on the property and commuted into San Antonio for work, but he left the
engineering firm in about 1934. Given their absence in San Antonio city directories during the 1930s,
except the notation of a rural address in 1931-1932, it seems likely that Friedrichs and his wife, Eva, lived
at 41BX1812 from about 1930-1938. They probably constructed the frame addition on the south façade of
the house with its distinctive stone chimney, and may have installed the stone landscaping features south
of the house.
In January 1938, the Friedrichs sold the 35 acres to John H. and Evelyn D. Fox (Deed Record 1619:374375), who held the property jointly until September 22, 1962, when John Fox died. A retired first
lieutenant, Fox was living at a rural address at the time of his death (San Antonio Light, September 25,
1962:18). A son quitclaimed Evelyn Fox his interest in the 35 acres in 1966 (Deed Record 5709:262), and
she continued to own the property until March 2, 1981, when she sold it to Rosetta Rubiola McCarty for
$139,216 (Deed Record 2255:1-2).
With a home in San Antonio and associations with a family that dealt in real estate, it seems likely that
McCarty acquired the Hausman Road property for investment purposes. After her death, her husband and
executor sold a small portion of the 35-acre tract to the City of San Antonio to accommodate the
replacement of the Hausman Road Bridge over Leon Creek (Official Public Record 5244:1828).
Apparently, the size of his wife’s estate made it difficult for McCarty to pay the associated estate taxes,
and so on November 18, 1994, the Internal Revenue Service seized the 34.804-acre tract and offered it for
sale at public auction. The purchaser was Forest Word, who received a quitclaim deed to the property
from the IRS on June 14, 1995 (Official Public Record 6483:327-330).
On August 3, 1995, Word sold the property to Nido, Inc., a San Antonio firm that was an entity of
Benjamin Davis (Official Public Record 6993:1234-1235; 9885:1326-1327). Nido, Inc., subsequently
quitclaimed the property to Davis and his sister, Christina Davis (Official Public Record 9885:13261327), who then sold it to Gerry Arrendondo and Richard Burlazzi on November 8, 2004 (Official Public
Record 11078:2385-2388). Arredondo and Burlazzi subsequently deeded the tract to the AB Hausman
61

Partnership on January 27, 2005, which sold the property to the City of San Antonio the same day
(Official Public Record 11200:1730-1733, 1734).

Recommendation
Properties such as 41BX1812 may be eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places if
they “possess integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association.” In
addition, the properties must fulfill at least one criterion for evaluation, which include the following:
Criterion A:

Association with “events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns

of our history.”
Criterion B:

Association with “the lives of persons significant in our past.”

Criterion C:

Embodiment of the “distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of

construction, or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a
significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction.”
Criterion D: “Have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history”
(U.S. Department of the Interior n.d.:2).
Site 41BX1812 is a farmstead complex consisting of a residence, duplex workers’ housing, barn,
equipment shed, water supply feature, possible milk house or shop, and numerous landscaping features.
The improvements appear to date to the World War I period and may have been occupied until the early
1960s. Construction and occupation may have been associated with Joe V. Bacon, who owned the
property between 1917 and 1921; J. W. Vasbinder from 1922-1925; E. F. Hunter from 1925-1929; Victor
Friedrichs from 1930-1938; and John H. and Evelyn Fox from 1938-1962. The complex was identified in
1922 as a dairy farm; it probably attained its current appearance sometime in the 1930s, although site
disturbances suggest that there were buildings on-site that have been demolished or moved.
Site 41BX1812 retains integrity of location. However, aspects of design, setting, workmanship, feeling,
and association have been negatively impacted by construction on adjacent property to the east,
modifications to the main residence, and deterioration of all standing structures, one of which (the well
house) is ruinous. Deterioration of the standing buildings and landscape features has negatively impacted
the aspects of feeling and association.
Site 41BX1812 is associated with the history of twentieth-century agriculture in northern Bexar County,
an economic endeavor that has made significant contributions to the broad patterns of local and state
62

history. However, a lack of integrity of the component parts of the site suggests that it is not eligible for
nomination to the National Register of Historic Places under Criterion A or Criterion C. The site is not
known to have been associated with the lives of significant persons (Criterion B), and it is unlikely to
yield information important in history (Criterion D). Site 41BX1812 is recommended as ineligible for
inclusion in the NRHP or listing as a SAL due to the lack of integrity, lack of individuals or events of
importance to the history of the region, and inability to provide additional useful information to the
history of the region.

Isolated Find 1

Isolated Find 1 is located north of Hausman Road on the east side of Leon Creek. It is approximately onehalf of a marble headstone (Figures 5-16 and 5-17) from a military cemetery. Identifying information on
the front of the stone is incomplete. The first name, “Edward,” can be deciphered, but only three letters of
the last name are present: “DIC” or “RIC.” The identifying information on the back of the headstone,
“92-A” may also represent all or a portion of the locational data.
The director of the Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery (Trower 2009) confirmed the affiliation of the
headstone as military, but a search of burial inventories for all surnames beginning with “DIC” and “RIC”
and having burial placement with the associated number and letter “92-A” at both the San Antonio
National Cemetery and the Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery failed to reveal the names of any likely
individuals. A field search of the San Antonio National Cemetery also did not reveal such a marker.
According to Trower (2009), it is common for older or damaged headstones to be broken and discarded at
the national cemeteries before they are replaced with new stones. Such broken stones are disposed of at a
cemetery, placed in an on-site dumpster, and carried off for disposal by a commercial vendor. An
intensive archaeological survey of the present-day vicinity of Isolated Find 1 did not record the presence
of the stone in 1994-1995. During the phase II testing of 41BX47, a Gradall trench was placed 14 meters
northeast of the current location of the headstone, and archaeologists would have encountered it at that
time. It seems likely, therefore, that it was discarded on-site sometime between 1995 and 2009.

History
The legal history of the land on which Isolated Find 1 is located is the same as that associated with Site
41BX1812 until after the death of Abbie K. Bacon in 1915 and the division of her property by four of her
children after 1916. At that point, her daughter, Lillian Bacon, received two tracts of land along Leon
Creek, the 130 acres south of Hausman Road being the location of Site 41BX1812 and the 190.1 acres
north of Hausman Road being the location of Isolated Finds 1 and 2 (see Figure 5-15).
Sometime between 1917 and 1929, Bacon married and then divorced J. A. Rusaw. Apparently suffering
from financial difficulties, she sold the 190.1-acre tract to her neighbor, Henry Moos, who owned the
greatest part of the John and Anna Rosina Moos Ranch. The ranch had been established in the mid-1870s
with John Moos’s initial purchase of the north one-third of the Pru league from Jane S. Anderson,
executrix of the estate of Joseph B. Anderson on April 14, 1874 (Deed Record 2:15).
Following John Moos’s death in about 1881, his widow acquired additional property, enlarging the ranch.
Eventually, her son Henry Moos acquired the largest part of the property through purchase of his
mother’s and siblings’ interests (Deed Record 201:306-307; 245:10-11; 409:99-103). His purchase of part
of the Bacon Ranch from Lillian Bacon Rusaw in 1929 extended the boundaries of his ranch southward to
Hausman Road.
Henry Moos owned the ranch until his death on March 18, 1947 (San Antonio Express, March 19,
1947:8A). Surviving heirs were Ida H. Smith, Tillie A. Gregory, and Rose Moos (Deed Record 2521:341343), and they sold the 1,917.87-acre Moos Ranch property on July 20, 1951, to San Antonio real estate
developers George W. Delavan, Sr., and R. R. Baines for $176,538.80 (Deed Record 3057:512-514). Six
years later, Baines deeded his interest in the ranch to Delavan (Deed Record 4035:92-93), who sold off a
number of tracts but retained approximately half of the property until 1969-1970. At that point, he sold
1,029.972 acres in five surveys, including the locations of Isolated Finds 1 and 2, to William B. Cox, Jr.,
as trustee for the Texas Industrial Laundries Profit Sharing Trusts (Deed Record 6199:741-745;
6299:841-845).
On November 27, 1974, Cox filed a subdivision plat with the county that depicted a separate 30.002-acre
lot 134 on Leon Creek. The tract lay along the creek north of Hausman Road (Deed Record 6199:741745; Plat Records 7500:146-147) and embraced the areas of Isolated Finds 1 and 2. However, the
designation of the tract appeared to serve no practical purpose, for it was part of a 124.728-acre tract sold
to H.T.O., Inc., on January 26, 1994, by William B. Cox as Trustee for Uniform Corporation Profit
Sharing Plan (Official Public Record 5948:1218-1222). UTO, Inc., then sold a 52.83-acre tract that
65

included a portion of lot 134, the 124.728-acre tract, and all of a 20.762-acre tract to Malcolm and Peggy
Wardlaw on December 3, 2001 (Official Public Record 9164:961-967). The parcel lay along Leon Creek
north of Hausman Road and extended north to UTSA Boulevard; it included the 34.566-acre tract that the
Wardlaws deeded to the City of San Antonio in 2007 (Official Public Record 13291:1242-1249;
13462:655) and was the location of Isolated Finds 1 and 2.

Isolated Find 2

Isolated Find 2 consists of a large upright stone (Figure 5-18) north of Hausman Road and east of Leon
Creek. It was suggested that this feature could possible be a Spanish Colonial or Mexican boundary or
way marker (Hindes 2009). Investigation of the history of the property on which the stone is located did
not reveal the existence of any legal boundary near the stone: the west line of the Pru league, surveyed in
1838, is located a considerable distance west of the stone on the west side of Leon Creek, and a
subsequent sale and survey in 1929 of the portion of the survey on which the marker is located was not
proximate to the stone. However, a projection of the Camino Viejo depicted on an 1850 map (see Figures
3-2 and 3-3) places that colonial road on the east side of Leon Creek. The frequency of informal and
formal deposition of construction materials in the area of Isolated Find 2 during the twentieth century
suggests that the stone may be associated with that activity. Several similar stones were encountered
during survey work (Figure 5-19). However, its possible function as a way marker cannot be ruled out at
this time.

History
The history of the property on which Isolated Find 2 is located is the same as that for Isolated Find 1.

Previously Recorded Site Results

All previously recorded sites within the project area were revisited during archaeological survey; this
includes the now combined sites 41BX40 and 41BX47, and sites 41BX52, 41BX233, and 41BX1064. aci
archaeologists attempted to locate sites 41BX48, 41BX53, 41BX72, and 41BX232 based on site data
from the site forms (Table 3-1); however, sites 41BX53, 41BX72 and 41BX232 are situated within the
heavily impacted landscape of the Hill Country Place apartment community. Site 41BX48 was located on
the edge of an eroding bluff, and all four sites are destroyed. The remaining four sites are discussed in
more detail below.

6.1

Site 41BX233

The position of site 41BX233 was located (see Figure 3-1) and shovel tested to negative results. However,
a single biface fragment was collected on the surface (Figure 6-1). No further work or management
strategies are required for these sites.

Figure 6-1. Biface fragment collected from the surface near site 41BX233.

6.2

Site 41BX52

The current landscape surrounding 41BX52 (Pavo Real) was intensively investigated during
archaeological survey and found to be heavily impacted by previous road construction endeavors. The
cultural deposits of Suites I, II, III, and IV are known to have extended approximately 15 to 30 meters
south of the east-bound access road of Loop 1604 according to aerial overlays (Figueroa and Frederick
2008). This portion of Pavo Real was thoroughly investigated with over 150 test units excavated to paleo
68

deposits, and over a dozen investigatory trenches (Collins et al. 2003). Excavations yielded rare Clovis
and Folsom materials in limited, undisturbed contexts. Currently, the majority of Pavo Real’s original
position falls within Loop 1604, and a great deal of its present matrix consists of construction road fill.
The southern portion of Pavo Real and its surrounding landscape has been impacted by construction and
numerous dumping episodes. Upon close inspection of the landscape, no cultural material or features
remain visible on the present ground surface. Due to the high degree of road development within the
center of the site and Pavo Real’s limited integrity, a site datum was not set. Very little of this locale’s
original upper landscape exists, but the specific location and site boundaries of 41BX52 are currently well
plotted (Figueroa and Frederick 2008), and additional mapping of site boundaries was not necessary.

Recommendation
A small portion of 41BX52, the Pavo Real site, rests within the northern portion of the trail APE. This
portion is the southern boundary of the site that extends beyond the Loop 1604’s west-bound access road
right-of-way. Deposits from Suites I, II, III, and IV within Pavo Real extend no further than
approximately 30 meters south of the access road (Figueroa and Frederick 2008: Figure 6-2), falling
within the APE of this project. These deposit suites were intensively investigated with a wide coverage of
excavation units, as well as boring and trenching. Furthermore, natural ground surface and deposits were
impacted by the construction of the east-bound access road of Loop 1604. Geotechnical coring within
Pavo Real in 2005 indicated construction fill 17 feet deep in some portions of the site. Within the APE,
numerous construction and development episodes are visible all over the landscape (Figure 6-3).
This area of the site has been highly disturbed, no surface cultural materials were recorded during survey,
and shovel testing resulted in the identification of no cultural materials. If previously unidentified
materials exist in deeply buried contexts they would be found at very deep depths greater than 10 feet and
well beyond the scope of any proposed construction for this project. It is possible they may also be
disturbed from previous building episodes. During the construction of the parking area and trail over
within site 41BX52 boundary if clearing is needed, an archeologist will be present to monitor the activity.
aci consulting recommends that this trail project will have no adverse effect on 41BX52, however long
term monitoring for evidence of erosion and possible impact is needed to protect the deeply buried
deposits at site 41BX52.

6.3

Site 41BX1064

Site 41BX1064 consists of a prehistoric midden site skirting the west bank of Leon Creek (Figures 6-4, 65, and 6-6). The site was recorded as destroyed in 2008 (Thompson et al. 2008). The site was relocated
during this survey and revisited again in December 2009 when vegetation had decreased. A small
number of flakes were recovered from a disturbed context. A manhole has been placed in a part of the site
causing additional disturbance near the edge of the site, and erosional control measures have been put in
place by the City of San Antonio adjacent to the road and drainage systems. The erosional control blocks
the ability to fully test this area. However, this segment of the west bank of Leon Creek contains very
little soil deposition as a result of normal stream flow erosion and is considered the concave bank (Waters
1992). It is likely that a small portion of the site extends into the manicured Valero property grounds
northeast of a Valero sports gymnasium outside of this project’s APE; however, the originally identified
boundaries of the site are no longer intact. The small disturbed portion of the site within the APE was
mapped.

Cultural Material Recovered from 41BX1064
Previously recorded site 41BX1064 rests along the severely eroded west bank of Leon Creek, and cultural
materials encountered during this project were collected from the ground surface. FCR specimens were
observed on the surface of the landscape of 41BX1064, but only debitage was collected. A total of six
flakes were recovered (Table 6-1). These six recovered flakes in conjunction with scattered isolates of
FCR suggest that a portion of 41BX1064 still exists.

Recommendations
Although recorded as being destroyed in 2008, a portion of site 41BX1064 was relocated during this
survey. This survey resulted in the recovery of surface material only and it is likely that any intact
subsurface deposits that may exist would be located within the northeastern corner of the Valero property
fence. The currently identified extent of site 41BX1064 was mapped and a site datum was set and
recorded. All visible artifacts were collected except for FCR specimens. Most of the site is located beyond
the city owned greenbelt; therefore, site significance cannot be fully determined. The sloped west bank of
Leon Creek is city owned and appears to have intact cultural deposits. We recommend stabilization of the
creek bank along with routine monitoring to preserve and protect the site

6.4

Site 41BX47

41BX47 is an Early and Middle Archaic site containing over 84 densely distributed burned rock features
that were investigated in 1996 (Tennis 1996). The site exhibits artifact and feature ratios that illustrate
subsistence shifts towards more intensive food processing (Hard and Bousman 1996). Initially, site
boundaries originally established in 1994 by CAR were relocated to conceptualize the expanse of the site,
however due to recent landscape modifications to facilitate garbage and rubble dumping, the significant
74

amount of scrubbing of top soil caused by flooding and clearing, and the original gravel pit included in
the original site boundary it was determined that new site boundaries would benefit our understanding of
the site (Figure 6-7). Ground surface depressions from the 59 Gradall trenches, in conjunction with
mapped natural landscape features, were used to identify the original testing areas and a GPS coordinate
for the new site datum was collected. A Nolan point dating to the Early Archaic (ca. 4000 to 2500 B.C.)
was recovered from the surface. Two shovel tests within the main footpath trail, just within the
southwestern boundaries of 41BX47, yielded lithic debitage material. In addition, the two shovel tests
yielded modern bottle glass fragments and fill matrix, indicating disturbed soils below the main footpath
alignment. Both positive shovel tests along the main footpath were delineated with shovel tests in all
cardinal directions. One delineation shovel test was positive and the additional thirteen delineation shovel
tests were negative for cultural material.
Four shovel tests (a-d) were conducted in the original site boundaries on the northeast portion of the site.
These shovel tests were excavated to depths of 60-80 cm below surface. All shovel tests were negative
for cultural material. The profiles of these shovel tests indicated that the top soils common in the other
shovel tests, typically a medium to medium-light brown clay loam, were absent. The entire profile
consisted of a light brown clay loam over stream gravels. This area appears to have been heavily
scrubbed by flooding, clearing, and construction activities which could have easily resulted in the
destruction of artifact bearing soils (Figure 6-8). This area of disturbance was also noted in Tennis and
Hard (1995).
Originally an arm branching off from the main footpath alignment was proposed to proceed through site
41BX47. According to previous phase II work conducted in 41BX47, this segment of the trail would have
impacted low, medium, and high density distribution areas of cultural material (Tennis 1996). A total of
19 shovel tests were excavated along this segment within 41BX47. Cultural material yielded from
positive shovel tests includes debitage and the distal end of a projectile point. Observed soil deposits were
undisturbed silty clays. Only possible FCR remains on the ground surface, but shovel testing along the
originally proposed arm segment within 41BX47 indicates that intact cultural deposits are present in this
area. This branch segment has since been cancelled and is no longer a part of the proposed project.
Additionally a complete surface collection was conducted for site 41BX47 on November 22, 2009. At
this time very little of the ground surface was visible due to dense vegetation. All areas with exposed
ground surface were investigated. One artifact scatter was identified and artifacts were collected.

75

Cultural Material Recovered from 41BX47
Shovel testing at 41BX47 yielded a total of 25 artifacts, and the surface collection resulted in the
collection of 9 artifacts (Table 6-2). One Early Archaic Nolan projectile point was recovered that consists
of a brown Edwards chert that is heavily patinated (Figure 6-9). This specimen was recovered from a
shovel test in disturbed soil and fill, and it exhibits a fresh break-surface on one of its shoulders. The
Nolan point exhibits a step fracture possible caused during manufacture. A distal end of a biface was also
recovered. The material of the biface consisted of an oolitic chert. The majority of debitage recovered
from 41BX47 during this field visit are non-cortical flakes. Two flakes retain small amounts of cortical
material, comprising 8 percent of the collection. For an in-depth summary of the extensive archaeological
record at 41BX47 refer to Tennis (1996).

Recommendation
Boundaries of 41BX47 were reestablished according to original defining margins ascertained by the CAR
before the site was subject to intensive excavation and dumping. Reestablished boundaries and a set site
datum were GPS plotted. The main trail segment for this project is proposed to proceed through the
southwestern most portion of 41BX47. This portion of the trail segment was shovel tested, and cultural
materials (including a diagnostic projectile point) were yielded, however deposits containing artifacts
along the main proposed trail segment proved to be disturbed. Based on previous investigations
conducted by the CAR, the southwestern portion of 41BX47 was subject to numerous backhoe and
Gradall trenches and thought to be low density (Tennis 1996). Although little easement “padding” exists
southeast of the trail in this area, a trail within this portion of the site would not contribute to the direct
impact of intact deposits (as deposits along the trail alignment are disturbed), and the indirect impact of
the trail’s presence would be minimal since the only cultural material resting on the ground surface of the
southwest portion of 41BX47 consists of isolated FCR specimens. On the other hand, an arm branching
off from the main trail segment is proposed to proceed northwest towards a drainage pool of Leon Creek.
This path appears to follow a previously utilized road (possibly related to the quarry or housing
development behind the property) that has begun revegetating. The projected path of this arm would pass
directly through medium and high density portions of 41BX47. This arm of the main trail segment was
shovel tested and artifacts within intact deposits (including a projectile point fragment) were recovered
from depths no deeper than 30 cm below ground surface (see Figure 6-7). It is the recommendation of aci
consulting that an alternative route to a collection pool be planned that does not bring pedestrians into the
interior of 41BX47 (see Figure 6-7).
At this time construction plans have been finalized, and both the originally proposed trail arm and the
proposed alternative have been abandoned. These areas should be revegetated to prevent their use and
further erosion. No plans to create a pedestrian access to the holding pond and encroach further upon site
41BX47 exist at this time.
The site was recommended by the CAR as eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places
(Tennis 1996), and was at one point proposed as a staging area for a UTSA-sponsored field school (Dr.
Robert Hard, personal communication). The site possesses significant research potential and impact to its
cultural properties should be protected.

Conclusions and Management Plan

This chapter reviews the findings of the aci consulting survey and provides preservation, protection, and
management recommendations for the eligible sites that may be impacted by the construction of the Leon
Creek Greenway trail.
The entire length of the footpath spanning from Loop 1604 to Babcock Road was subject to intensive 100
percent pedestrian survey. All branches of the main trail were also pedestrian surveyed. With the
exception of only a few portions of the project area where developed landscape did not allow it, the APE
was shovel tested in both high and low probability localities. The entire project area, consisting of the
proposed trail route and its surrounding real estate, was subject to 153 shovel tests and intensive
pedestrian survey. The survey resulted in the identification of two previously unrecorded archaeological
sites and one historic homestead. One site is an Early Archaic prehistoric campsite (41BX1810), one is a
prehistoric campsite of undetermined age (41BX1811), and the historic farmstead (41BX1812) reflects
construction characteristics of the 1920’s and 1930’s. Two additional isolated finds were recorded and
archival research was conducted on both potentially historic isolated finds and the historic farmstead. The
newly recorded sites are recommended not eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic
Places under Criteria A-D., and should not influence the projected alignment of the pedestrian footpath.
During the survey, an attempt was made to relocate and reassess sites 41BX48, 41BX53, 41BX72, and
41BX232. These four sites have all been destroyed by modern landscape modification, construction,
erosion, and other similar activities.
Sites 41BX47 (combined with 41BX40), 41BX52, 41BX233, and 41BX1064 were also relocated and
reassessed. 41BX47 was relocated, remapped, and original site boundaries were reestablished. The
locality containing 41BX52 (Pavo Real) extends approximately five meters into the northern part of the
trail APE. The remainder of the site is located completely within the Loop 1604 right-of-way. The
majority of its shallow deposits have been severely impacted by the construction of Loop 1604 and its
eastbound access road. No further work is recommended at this portion of 41BX52. Site 41BX233 was
tested with no subsurface materials recovered and only one surface artifact recorded. No further work is
recommended at 41BX233. Site 41BX1064 was revisited and rerecorded. It has been subject to erosion,
development, and dumping. The only remaining portion of the site rests just outside of the APE and on
the sloping west bank of Leon Creek. No further work is warranted at 41BX1064 based on poor site
integrity.

82

Suggested Management of Archaeological Properties
The trail preservation, protection, and management plan needs to be designed based on the potential direct
and indirect impacts. Direct impact involves the disturbance of deposits through the construction or
surfacing of a pedestrian foot trail. Indirect impact relates more to an archaeological site’s vulnerability to
public foot traffic off the trail, collecting and looting. People often leave trails and create new paths which
can be detrimental to archaeological sites; in addition, public collecting and looting can occur when
people pick up artifacts off of the ground surface or destructively dig into subsurface cultural deposits. In
this case, the entire project area was inspected for cultural materials visible on the surface, and the
majority of artifacts were collected. However, erosion and other geomorphological processes alter the
ground surface, frequently exposing once buried cultural materials. Both direct and indirect impacts to
significant archaeological sites are concerns and are difficult to manage and prevent. The below
recommendations for site 41BX47 are proposed for the main trail. Should plans be altered or revisited in
the future, consultation with THC must be reinitiated to discuss plans for alternate trails in and adjacent to
41BX47.
aci consulting recommends a four part preservation and protection plan for site 41BX47. First, clean back
fill should be utilized to fill open holes and stabilize the area in and around 41BX47 to prevent erosion,
protect individuals from falling into open areas, and discourage looting. Secondly, monthly visits should
be conducted for the first six months the trail is open to monitor activity in and around the site. This will
be critical for evaluating the impacts to this resource, and, after the initial six months of monitoring, the
amount of visitation can be re-assessed in consultation with the Texas Historical Commission. During
these visits, any surface materials will again be collected, and evidence of looting will be observed, noted,
and reported. Third, a complete surface collection is recommended at 41BX47. A surface collection was
conducted on November 22, 2009 and again on January 18, 2010. In addition to the monitoring of the
sites it is recommended that any visible artifacts be collected during those visits. Artifacts can be mapped
and added to the collection housed at University of Texas-San Antonio. Finally, the City of San Antonio
will post signs at the entrance and egress of the trail and along the southern boundary of site 41BX47. The
signs will indicate that the area is for native habitat restoration and to remain only on the trail. The signs
posted will continue to use the same legal language as other signs utilized along the City of San Antonio
greenways and along this trail (see Appendix B). During the monitoring by the City of San Antonio
Archaeologist, if it appears looting has become an issue within the site boundaries, negotiations with THC
will be conducted regarding fencing.
During the monitoring of the site, if signs of looting or adverse effects to the archaeological site are
83

observed, mitigation of the archaeological site may be necessary. At that time excavation of one or more
portions of the site, combined with public outreach efforts, may be appropriate, but additional
consultation with the Texas Historic Commission will be necessary.
