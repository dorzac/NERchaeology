ABSTRACT
In June and October 2003, personnel from Prewitt and Associates, Inc., conducted a pedestrian
survey of ca. 320 acres within the proposed Sabine Mine Area Q in Harrison County, Texas. An
additional 206 acres were surveyed in February 2004, and 87 acres were surveyed in June and
August 2004. Four previously recorded sites-41HS536, 41HS537, 41HS573, and 41HS574-were
revisited, and 10 new sites-41HS841-41HS846 and 41HS850-41HS853-were recorded. Of these
14 sites, 12 are predominantly prehistoric (1 has a very minor historic component) and 2 are
predominantly historic (1 has a very minor prehistoric component). Artifacts collected from these
sites and the records generated by the survey are curated at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory.
Both of the historic sites-4HS841and41HS842-are considered ineligible for listing in the
National Register ofHistoric Places, as is the minor historic component at 41HS573. Of the prehistoric
sites, 41HS536, 41HS845, 41HS851, 41HS852, and 41HS853 are considered ineligible for National
Register listing, along with the minor prehistoric component at 41HS842. The other seven prehistoric
sites-41HS537, 41HS573, 41HS574, 41HS843, 41HS844, 41HS846, and 41HS850-need further
work before they can be assessed in terms of National Register eligibility. Test excavations are
recommended to determine whether they are associated with the nearby Caddoan mound and village
complex at 41HS15 and, if so, identify what kinds of important information, if any, they contain.

INTRODUCTION
Between June 2003 and August 2004, personnel from Prewitt and Associates, Inc. (PAI),
conducted archeological investigations for The
Sabine Mining Company in Harrison County,
Texas. The investigations consisted of pedestrian
survey of 613 acres ofland in Sabine Mine's Area
Q, ca. 8-11 km south-southwest of Marshall, 36 km south of Interstate Highway 20, east of
State Highway 43, and north of FM 2625 (Figure 1). The work was completed in three phases,
divided into eight survey areas. The first phase
of work was completed in October 2003 and covered 320 acres (Survey Areas 1-3). The second
phase of work, completed in February 2004, covered 206 acres (Survey Areas 4-6). The third
phase, completed in August 2004, covered 87
acres (Survey Areas 7 and 8). Fourteen archeological sites were investigated: 4 previously recorded sites and 10 new sites. Of the 14, 12 are
mostly prehistoric and 2 are mostly historic.

ARCHEOLOGICAL AND
HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
Investigations by both avocational and professional archeologists over the years have identified many important sites and revealed that
the middle Sabine basin has had a long and complex history of use by Native Americans.
Occupation of the larger northeast Texas area
during the Paleoindian period (10,000-6,000 B.c.)
is demonstrated by the frequent, if not abundant, occurrence of projectile points such as
Clovis, Dalton, San Patrice, and Scottsbluff and
other distinctive tools like Albany scrapers, Red
River knives, and Dalton adzes (Story 1990:177)
at sites such as John Pearce in Caddo Parish
just east of Harrison County (Webb et al. 1971),
Jake Martin in Upshur County (Davis and Davis
1960), and Forrest Murphey in Marion County
(Story 1990:180). Story (1990:177; Story et al.
1990:425-426) observes that Paleoindian sites
typically contain limited amounts ofrefuse and
that the assemblages are marked by the following: high selectivity in tool types with carefully
fashioned bifaces and unifaces being especially
common; extensive curation, refurbishing, and
recycling of tools; frequent use of high-quality,
often nonlocal, lithic materials; a near-absence
of tools and facilities indicative of plant processing; and broad distributions of particular artifact styles. Based on these characteristics, she
speculates that Paleoindian adaptations in
northeastern Texas involved high residential
mobility and large territories, short-lived occupations by small groups at individual sites, low
population densities and hence little competition for resources, a generalized subsistence
strategy focusing on hunting rather than plant
collecting, and fluidity in group composition and
movement as a means of avoiding or resolving
economic or social problems.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The Sabine Mine Area Q is located between
Colliers and Potters Creeks, ca. 7-11 km north
of the floodplain of the Sabine River. The upland sands in this area are derived from weathering of the lower Eocene Wilcox Formation,
which was deposited by the Mount Pleasant
Fluvial System as channel and overbank sediments (Fisher and McGowen 1967:105). As elsewhere in eastern Texas (e.g., Fields et al. 1991;
Perttula et al. 1986), some colluvial redeposition
of these upland sands may have occurred during the Holocene; however, shovel testing done
during this and previous surveys in southern
Harrison County indicate that, in many places,
these deposits are thin (i.e., less than 50 cm).
Hence, many upland areas have a limited potential for deeply buried sites. In contrast,
thicker Holocene deposits, both colluvial and fluvial, are found along the Sabine River and its
tributaries (Keller 2000:5).
Southern Harrison County is in the Piney
Woods of northeast Texas, where upland overstoryvegetation is dominated by shortleaf(Pinus
echinata) and loblolly (P. taeda) pines and deciduous species such as red oak (Quercus
falcata), white oak (Q. alba), post oak (Q.
stellata), and hickory (Carya texana). Bottomland overstory vegetation typically consists of

The remains of occupations by Archaic
groups (6000-200 B.c.)-especially late Archaic
peoples-are abundant in northeastern Texas,
although a complete sequence of artifact styles
and assemblages has yet to be developed.
According to Story (1990:213; Story et al.
1990:426), Archaic period sites are characterized
by greater quantities of refuse, the appearance
of tools and facilities suggestive of plant processing, tools that were less well made and more
frequently of local materials than those of the
Paleoindian period, functionally diverse tool
assemblages containing relatively large proportions of expedient tools, limited tool curation and
recycling compared to the Paleoindian period,
reasonably distinctive regional artifact styles,
and the appearance of cemeteries. From these
observations, she suggests that Archaic period
adaptations involved the seasonal foraging and
hunting of a wide variety of resources with plant
foods attaining greater importance than earlier,
exploitation patterns that were more intensive
and more focused geographically than were patterns of Paleoindian land use, better defined and
less-extensive group territories, decreased residential mobility and hence less direct access to
nonlocal materials, and more involvement in
trade relationships as a means of solving economic and social problems. Although Archaic
artifacts are common in the region, excavated
sites that are predominantly Archaic in age or
where Archaic components can be isolated from
later components are rare. Some of the excavated
Archaic sites in the region include Jake Martin
in Upshur County (Davis and Davis 1960),
Yarbrough in Van Zandt County (Johnson 1962),
Finley Fan in Hopkins County (Gadus et al.
1992), Tankersley Creek in Titus County (Young
1981), and 41BW422 in Bowie County (Tucker
1994). None of these are in the middle Sabine
basin, but there is no reason to suppose that such
sites are not present there.
The Woodland period (200 B.C.-A.D. 800)
covers the ca. 1,000-year span preceding the appearance of the Caddoan culture and hence is
pivotal to understanding this important cultural
development in northeastern Texas. The origins
of the Caddoan culture have been debated for
many years, but Story's (1990) recent synthesis
of the archeology of the region suggests that
speakers of Caddoan languages occupied the
area before the development of a recognizable
Caddoan archeological tradition, that the adop-

tion of maize agriculture did not trigger the
Caddoan florescence, and that early Caddoan
culture was influenced by but did not develop
out of Lower Mississippi Valley cultures. Thus,
according to Story (1990:293), "... there can be
little doubt that the emergence of a distinctive
southern Caddoan archeological tradition was
basically an in situ development within resident
communities of Caddoan speakers." This is
supported by Perttula's (1990) view of the
coevolution of cultural systems and cultivated
plants in the region.
In brief, Perttula (1990:Part I, 70-97) suggests that there was substantial continuity in
subsistence strategies from the late Archaic period through the early half of the Caddoan period, including increased use of domesticated
cucurbits, bottle gourds, and native plants with
oily and starchy seeds such as sumpweed,
Chenopodium, maygrass, knotweed, and sunflower. Although tropical cultigens were
introduced during this time and were present
across the Caddoan region by ca. A.D. 1,000, the
development of true agroecological systems, and
hence the adoption of vastly different subsistence strategies, did not occur until later, probably after A.D. 1200 (Perttula 1990:Part I, 97).
While the idea of local origins for the Caddoan
culture is likely to hold up under further
scrutiny, there are limited data from excavated,
discrete Woodland sites in the northeast Texas
region as a whole with which to evaluate this
hypothesis. One of the more-important excavated sites dating to this interval, the Resch site
(Webb et al. 1969), is situated on Potters Creek
just outside the Sabine Mine Area Q, and it is
likely that the valleys of the major Sabine River
tributaries saw substantial occupations during
this time.
There is ample evidence for intensive use of
the middle Sabine basin during the Caddoan
period (A.D. 800-1700). Perttula (1994) identifies
a number of mound sites apparently representing civic-ceremonial centers, including six
(41HS4, 41HS15, 41HS233, 41PN1, 41RK3, and
41RK4) in parts of Harrison, Panola, and Rusk
Counties near the Sabine Mine, and it is certain
that the remains of many hamlets and small
villages are scattered around these mound centers. One of these mound centers (41HS15) is
adjacent to the Area Q survey areas, and some
of the prehistoric sites recorded during the 20032004 surveys reported here likely are associated
3

According to Perttula and Skiles (1987:20),
land ownership in southern Harrison County
had stabilized by the beginning of the Civil War,
when it was characterized by a combination of
planters and yeoman farmers. Production of cotton and livestock persisted throughout the war,
helping to create a local economy that benefited
from the presence of a Confederate powder mill
and ordnance concentration center in Marshall
and a meat-packing house and shoe and leather
goods manufactory in Jefferson, an important
port early in the war (Perttula 1987:20, 22, 80).
The end of war, however, brought with it economic and demographic destabilization. Although some plantation-era families kept their
lands, much property in the region changed
hands soon after the war ended. In addition,
nearly 20 percent of the African Americans in
Harrison County had acquired some property.
Sharecropping gradually developed as a dominant economic arrangement within agricultural
communities, and it remained a system in which
both black and white populations were involved.
Cotton was the most frequently cultivated crop,
and, as Van Duyne and Byers (1912:1059) expressed it, not even the construction of the Texas
and Pacific Railroad across Harrison County in
the early 1870s could change either "the character of the crops or ... the methods of farming."
What the arrival of railroads did facilitate
was a broadening of the economy through exploitation of east Texas forests. Lumbering on
an ever-larger scale encouraged immigration as
well, and during the last two decades of the nineteenth century, there was an influx of new settlers into southern Harrison County, brought
there by an upsurge in sawmilling.

with this site. One of the most important excavated residential sites in northeastern Texas, the
Oak Hill Village site (Rogers and Perttula 2004),
is in Rusk County not far from the Sabine Mine.
Temporal patterns are not well defined, but the
evidence seems to point to especially intensive
occupation of this part of the Sabine basin during the middle and latter parts of the Caddoan
period, which is consistent with the apparently
high frequency of late sites on Potters Creek
(Webb et al. 1969:7-9). Also present in the area
are a number of early historic Caddo sites (Webb
et al. 1969:7-9), and Perttula and Skiles
(1987:12) suggest that these represent occupations by N adaco or Anadarko groups.
Previous investigations ofhistoric sites near
the current project area and studies of east Texas
and Harrison County have concluded that the
region was rural and agrarian throughout the
nineteenth century; that settlers were, and continued to be, geographically persistent through
multiple generations; and that urban and industrial development did not become a significant
aspect of the cultural landscape until late in the
century. Timbering eventually became a factor
in local and regional economies, and mining contributed to the economy as well by the second
decade of the twentieth century. During the
same period, however, agriculture persistedwhether in the form of farming or ranching-so
that by the mid-twentieth century, the area was
characterized by a mixed industrial-agricultural
economy created by residents, many of whom
were members of families who had lived there
for multiple generations.
According to Perttula and Skiles (1987),
Freeman (1978), Campbell (1983, 1984), and Van
Duyne and Byers (1912), parts of present-day
Harrison County were surveyed by speculators
in the mid-1830s, and some limited settlement
had occurred by the late 1830s. However, settlement remained slow for another decade, at which
time a number of wealthy planters from Virginia,
the Carolinas, Tennessee, Alabama, and Georgia
began to move in with their slaves. Some families established plantations that grew as they
acquired additional land. At the same time,
industrial activity was limited, consisting most
frequently of plantation-based mills and gins
such as the gin operated by Colonel James Fears
Roseborough on Potters Creek and the steam
saw and grist mill operated by E. M. Wilder 11
miles south of Marshall.

RESULTS OF FILE SEARCH
Before fieldwork began, a file search was
conducted at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory, The University of Texas at Austin
(TARL) and using the Texas Historical
Commission's Archeological Sites Atlas to obtain
information about the many sites previously
recorded in Sabine Mine's Area Q and adjacent
land. Dr. James E. Corbin of Stephen F. Austin
State University conducted a survey for the
Amoco Production Company of the Pennington
Lindsey gas pipeline in 1993. This route runs
through Survey Areas 2 and 6 and just outside
the southeastern boundary of Survey Area 3.

been destroyed, and no artifacts were recovered
from the shovel tests) or 41HS841 (modern and
historic cultural materials are mixed). Each site
is described under the Site Descriptions section
later in this report.

Two prehistoric sites recorded during Corbin's
survey, 41HS536 and 41HS537, were revisited
during the current investigations. Two other
sites recorded previously by Bo Nelson and Tim
Perttula, 41HS573 and 41HS574, are in Survey
Area 7 and were revisited as well. Southern Archaeological Consultants recorded 137 sites during an extensive 15,000-acre survey of the
Sabine Mine's South Marshall Permit Area undertaken in 1995-1998 (Keller 2000). These sites
include 90 prehistoric, 39 historic or modern, and
8 multicomponent prehistoric and historic sites.
Some of these sites are near the area investigated in 2003-2004, but none are actually within
the survey areas.

Survey Area 1
Survey Area 1 encompasses 60 acres and is
east of State Highway 43, ca. 3.2-3.9 km north
of the intersection of State Highway 43 and
FM 2625. It is bordered on the north by Fyffe
Cut-Off Road and on the west by State Highway 43. Potters Creek crosses Survey Area 1 just
north of the southern boundary. The northern
and southern portions of this area are uplands
adjacent to Potters Creek, and the Potters Creek
floodplain covers the central to southern portions. Most of this floodplain is low and wet and
could not be shovel tested.
Visibility throughout Survey Area 1 was
generally poor, with dense grass covering 95
percent of the land. Portions of the area are used
for pasture, and a modern house, yard, and associated outbuildings are situated in the center
of the area (Figure 2). Several older homes front
Fyffe Cut-Off Road at the northern border of
Survey Area 1. Also, a gas well pad lies on the
floodplain just east of State Highway 43. Other
disturbances include two stock tanks at the
north end of the survey area and a transmission line that has a ca. 40-m-wide clearing at
the far southwest end.
Twenty-seven shovel tests were excavated
in Area 1. The tests ranged from 5 to 100 cm in
depth. Although most tests reached a strong
brown clay at 5-55 cm below the surface, 3 did
not encounter the clayey subsoil and were terminated at 80-100 cm below the surface. Six
tests (1-6) were on an interfluve nose in the
northeast portion of Survey Area 1 and exposed
7-10 cm of brown sandy loam over 10-45 cm of
strong brown sandy clay loam with ironstone
gravels underlain by strong brown sandy clay. A
single interior flake was recovered at 0-20 cm
below the surface in Shovel Test 5. No other tests
in the vicinity recovered cultural materials, and
this isolated find was not recorded as a site.
Six shovel tests (7-12) were placed along
interfluve slopes east of Potters Creek in the
central part of the survey area. These tests
ranged from 5 to 40 cm deep and exposed dark
gray to gray silty clay loam mottled with strong

RESULTS OF SURVEY
This survey was conducted in three phases.
The first phase covered Areas 1, 2, and 3, totaling 320 acres. Areas 4, 5, and 6 were surveyed
during the second phase, totaling 206 acres. The
third phase covered Areas 7 and 8, encompassing 87 acres. A total of 486 shovel tests were
excavated during these three phases (where referenced in this report, the tests from the second
and third phases of work are given the prefix
"2" and "3" to distinguish them from the tests
dug in the first phase). Some survey areas are
contiguous-Area 6 is situated between two portions ofArea 2, Area 5 lies directly north of Area
3, Area 7 adjoins Area 5 on the east and south
and Area 4 on the north, and Area 8 is just south
of Area 1-and two sites cross the boundaries
between survey areas (41HS842 is in Areas 2
and 6, and 41HS846 is in Areas 3 and 5).
The eight tracts of land are situated east of
State Highway 43 and north of FM 2625 (see
Figure 1). A three- or four-person crew walking
at 30-m intervals surveyed all eight areas. A total of 486 shovel tests were placed where landforms appeared to be most suited for
archeological sites. These tests measured
30x30 cm and were dug in 20-cm levels to depths
ranging 5 to 115 cm. All sediments removed were
screened through 1/4-inch-mesh hardware cloth.
Fourteen sites were recorded or revisited, and
artifacts were collected from 12 of them
(41HS537, 41HS573, 41HS574, 41HS84241HS846, 41HS850, 41HS851, 41HS852, and
41HS853); these artifacts and the notes generated by the project are curated at TARL. Artifacts were not collected from 41HS536 (it has

silty clay over strong brown sandy clay or
mottled gray silty clay. No cultural materials
were recovered. Six shovel tests (13-18) were
placed on an interfluve midslope in the northwest corner of Area 1 south and west of a historic home (Site 41HS841) described in the Site
Descriptions section below. A brick well was inspected east of the third house on Fyffe Cut-Off
Road, east of State Highway 43. From a distance,
the well appeared to be historic, but the machinemade bricks and an informant's report indicate
that it dates to the 1950s-1960s.
Five shovel tests (19-23) were placed on the
west side of Area 1 on lower interfluve slopes
and were excavated to 9 to 40 cm, exposing
brown sandy loam over strong brown sandy clay
or the same mottled with light gray silty clay.
One basal sherd of stoneware with dark brown
interior glaze was recovered from Level 2 (0-20 cm)
in Shovel Test 20. No other cultural materials
were found in the vicinity, however, and thus this
isolated artifact was not recorded as a site. Finally, four shovel tests (24-27) were placed on a
terrace south of Potters Creek along the far
southern boundary of Survey Area 1. These tests

were excavated to 80-100 cm and exposed light
brown to dark yellowish brown sand and did not
reach a clay substrate. No cultural materials
were found in these tests.
Survey Areas 2 and 6

Survey Areas 2 and 6 lie ca. 1.6 km east of
the intersection of State Highway 43 and
FM 2625 (see Figure 1). This land is divided into
three sections: the 60-acre eastern and 30-acre
western tracts were surveyed during the first
phase of work as Area 2. Access to the 23-acre
central tract (Area 6) was gained late in 2003,
and work there was conducted during the second survey phase. These tracts occupy mostly
uplands east of Potters Creek. The western tract
was used for grazing at one time, but now lies
fallow and heavily overgrown. There is a gas well
at the east end of the tract, and two gas lines,
one running east-west and the other northsouth, cross the western tract as well (Figure 3).
Timber has been cut off the western property
within the past 5-10 years, resulting in extremely dense saplings. Vegetation is thick
6

shovel tests were placed on 41HS536, a previously recorded prehistoric lithic scatter. Twenty
tests were placed on 41HS842, a historic
housesite with a light scatter of prehistoric artifacts. These are described under the Site Descriptions section below.
Eleven shovel tests (28-38) were placed on
the northern arm of the western tract extending from the top of an interfluve down to a tributary of Potters Creek. These reached depths of
5-50 cm and exposed brown sandy loam over
strong brown sandy clay. The remains of a
ca. 8x10-m corral and livestock chute were observed in the northeast corner of the northern
part of this tract. Although it is difficult to determine the age of the corral, no cut nails were
observed in the remaining wood, and it was not
recorded as an archeological site. Fifteen shovel
tests (39-53) were placed in densely wooded secondary growth on an upper interfluve slope.
These tests reached 15-50 cm below the surface
with brown sandy loam over reddish brown to
yellowish brown sandy clay. Eight shovel tests

throughout most of this area, and ground surface visibility is very poor. The central tract has
been cleared, and only a few ca. 15-year-old pine
trees are scattered at the far south and north
ends of the tract. A drainage runs southwest to
northeast across the southern portion of the
tract. Drainage improvements and erosion have
resulted in ca. 2 acres of ditch-related disturbance near the southern end of this tract. A remodeled trailer home sits on the west side,
midway through the tract. The central tract is
grassy, and visibility is poor. Although the eastern tract was cleared at one time, the landscape
appears to have naturalized, with open patches,
evergreen shrubs, and older trees. A stock tank
is the only disturbance noted other than natural erosion. Visibility is poor for the most part,
but erosion and slopewash, especially in the
north and east portions of the tract, improved
visibility in those areas.
Ninety-five shovel tests were dug in Areas
2 and 6-53 on the western tract, 20 on the center tract, and 22 on the eastern tract. Seven

ing landscape is made up of the slopes and crests
of interfluves and terraces east and west of
Starkey Creek (Figure 4). Starkey Creek Road
cuts through the northwest portion of the area.
Open portions of Survey Area 3 are pastureland,
and wooded areas are fallow. Visibility is generally poor, with thick grass covering open fields
and dense leaf-fall in wooded portions. Two-track
farm roads provide improved visibility in some
areas. Sheetwash on slopes also provide exposures with good visibility. A house, a stock tank,
two trailer homes, and outbuildings lie at the
northwest corner along Starkey Creek Road.
Two stock tanks have been dug in the eastern
part of Survey Area 3.
A total of 155 shovel tests were dug in Survey Area 3, 63 of which were on or around sites.
Twenty-one shovel tests (72-78, 146-157, 173,
and 17 4) were at previously recorded site
41HS537. Six tests (155, 158, and 160-163) were
at 41HS843. Eight tests (164--171) were placed
on 41HS844. Six shovel tests (107-111and172)
were at 41HS845. Twenty-two shovel tests (206,
212-229, and 231-232, and 234) were excavated
at 41HS846 during the first phase. Each of these
sites is discussed in the Site Descriptions section below.
The remaining 92 tests were in nonsite areas.
Nineteen of these tests (79-93 and 95-98) were
at the far eastern end of Area 3 on the uplands
east and west of a tributary of Starkey Creek.
These ranged from 20 to 55 cm deep and exposed
light to dark yellowish brown sand over strong
brown sandy clay. Twenty-eight tests (118-145)
were on the upland crest and slopes east of
Starkey Creek in the northern part of the area.
These tests reached depths of 5 to 50 cm, exposing light brown to brown sand over strong brown
or mottled gray and brown clay. One piece of
debitage was found in Shovel Test 141, Level 2.
No other cultural materials were found in the
vicinity, however, and this isolated find was not
recorded as a site. Six negative tests (112-117)
were on lower slopes northeast of the Starkey
Creek floodplain near the north edge of the area.
These ranged from 63 to 100 cm deep and exposed brown to yellowish brown sand to sandy
loam over gray to dark brown mottled clay.
Shovel Tests 113-116 did not encounter the underlying clay.
Thirty-two negative shovel tests (159, 176205, and 208) were on the upland slopes and
adjacent Starkey Creek floodplain in the south

(54-61) were placed on an interfluve crest northwest of the gas well pad and recovered modern
glass and a few pieces of asphalt shingle ranging from 0 to 50 cm below the surface. Because
the material was obviously recent, it was not
recorded as an archeological site. These tests
exposed 35-70 cm of dark brown sandy loam
over strong brown sandy clay to clay loam. Three
negative shovel tests (62-64) were placed north
of the gas well pad and exposed 20-45 cm of
yellowish brown to brown sand to sandy clay
over strong brown or mottled strong brown and
yellowish brown clay. Finally, nine negative
shovel tests (249-257) were excavated after thick
vegetation was cleared mechanically from the
southern section of Survey Area 2, south of a
recent unmapped tributary of Potters Creek.
These tests ranged from 25 to 100 cm deep and
exposed grayish brown to pale brown sandy or
silty loam over gray or reddish brown sandy clay
with iron veins or concretions. Shovel Tests 254,
256, and 257 reached clayey subsoil at 25-65 cm
below the surface.
Twelve shovel tests were excavated on
nonsite portions of Area 6, the central tract,
north of the drainage ditch. One test yielded a
few historic items (a wire nail, three brick fragments, and a piece of glass) from the upper 20 cm,
but these were not recorded as a site because
the surrounding shovel tests were sterile. Here,
shovel tests ranged from 12 to 50 cm deep with
10-40 cm of grayish, yellowish or reddish brown
sand overlying strong silty clay to sandy clay
loam.
Ten shovel tests were excavated on nonsite
portions of the eastern tract of Survey Area 2 on
the crest and slopes of an interfluve. These were
placed on the north, northeast, and southeast
portions of the landform. These ranged from 0
to 45 cm deep and exposed brown to dark brown
or strong brown sand to sandy loam over strong
brown or mottled light brown to light strong
brown sandy clay; none yielded any cultural
materials.

Survey Area 3
Survey Area 3 is a 170-acre tract ca. 2 km
east of State Highway 43 and ca. 0. 7 km north
of FM 2625 (see Figure 1). Starkey Creek and
its broad floodplain occupy the west-central part
of the tract, and the headwaters of a tributary
run through the far northeast tip. The remain8

10 to 60 cm and were terminated when it became apparent that the landscape had been altered. Highly mottled soils were observed in
these tests.

part of Survey Area 3. Strong brown clay was on
the surface at Shovel Tests 183and186. Shovel
Tests 181-194 exposed strong brown clay at 638 cm below the surface. Shovel Tests 198, 201,
and 202 exposed deep brown sand over gray or
mottled silty clay to gray and strong brown clay
loam. Shovel Test 199 exposed 20 cm of brown
sand over clay. A low area south of Starkey Creek
was surveyed but was not shovel tested because
of standing water. Shovel Test 159 was placed
in a drier part of the floodplain between
41HS537 and 41HS843. It encountered dark
yellowish brown sandy loam over yellowish tan
sand. Strong brown sandy clay was reached at
76 cm below the surface. Shovel Test 208 was
placed on the floodplain south of Starkey Creek
and west of Starkey Creek Road and exposed 020 cm of light brown clay loam. Most of the remaining tests encountered 55-65 cm of dark
brown sandy loam over strong brown sandy clay.
Seven negative shovel tests (207, 209-211,
230, 233, and 236) were on a terrace north of
Starkey Creek in an area that has been altered
for a trailer home, stock tank, and trash pit, just
west of 41HS846. These ranged in depth from

Survey Area 4
Survey Area 4 is north of Fyffe Cut-Off Road
and begins ca. 0.9 km east of State Highway 43.
The 60-acre tract encompasses Starkey Creek
and its narrow floodplain and the uplands to the
west and some to the east. Two small tributary
drainages cut northeast-southwest across the
middle of the tract.
Visibility is poor throughout Area 4. Vegetation is dense, consisting of secondary regrowth
that is extremely thick over much of the tract.
Many unmapped small drainages feed into the
two tributaries. These are deep and probably
were cut rapidly after the timber was cut, as is
so common in this area. Sheetwash was probably a secondary effect at one time, although,
with the thick vegetation, it is not a problem
now. Three gas pipelines run through Area 4:
one runs north-south along the west boundary

4. A modern scatter of household items was noted
in the northwest corner of the southern half of
the area, ca. 0.6 km east of Canaan Church. Beds,
televisions, couches, chairs, carpeting, toilets, and
sinks are most common, suggesting the material was removed from a hotel. Additional items
include building materials, engine parts, and
Mardi Gras beads. Finally, wood slats and asphalt shingles were noted. All of these materials appear to have been brought in and dumped
along the gas pipeline right of way. Most of the
material is piled to the north and west of the
Area 4 boundary. This was not recorded as a site
because the material was brought into the area
and appears to date to the 1970s-1980s.

(Figure 5), a second runs east-west across the
midsection, and a third runs east-west ca. 350 m
south of the northern boundary. A ca. 30-m-wide
strip of vegetation has been cleared along each
of the pipelines, providing the only open portions
inArea4.
Fifty-four shovel tests were excavated in
Area 4. These ranged from 15 to 100 cm deep,
with most between 2 and 40 cm. Most reached
strong brown clay between 20 and 40 cm; four
did not encounter the clayey subsoil and were
terminated 80-100 cm below the surface. With
the exception of these four, all shovel tests exposed brown, yellowish brown, or grayish brown
sand to silty sand over strong brown clay. Thirtyseven shovel tests (2-1through2-37) were placed
in the southwest section on the uplands overlooking Starkey Creek. Eight tests (2-38 through
2-45) were placed along Starkey Creek. Five
tests (2-46 through 2-50) were placed between
the two east-west pipelines. Finally, four tests
(2-51 through 2-54) were placed north of the
northernmost pipeline.
No prehistoric cultural materials were recovered in the 54 shovel tests excavated in Area

Survey Area 5
Survey Area 5 is a ca. 117-acre tract ca. 1.9 km
east of State Highway 43 and 1.5 km north of
FM 2625. Like Area 3 to the south, Area 5 encompasses portions of Starkey Creek and its
floodplain with the slopes and crests of interfluves and terraces east and west of the creek.
An eastern tributary of Starkey Creek flows

associated with these homes.
Eighty-six shovel tests were dug in Area 5.
Of these, 10 were at previously recorded site
41HS846, which extends northward into the area
from Area 3, and 22 were at newly recorded sites
41HS850 and 41HS851. The remaining 54 shovel
tests were in nonsite areas. Fourteen negative
tests (2-55 through 2-67) were in the northern
extension of Area 5 on the uplands and floodplains east and west of Starkey Creek. These
tests revealed 4-55 cm ofbrown, grayish brown,
or yellowish brown sand to sandy loam over
strong brown clay. Twenty negative shovel tests
(2-81through2-100) were on the floodplain and
lower nose slopes flanking Starkey Creek in the
north-central portion of the survey area. These
tests ranged from 18 to 80 cm deep and generally exposed brown to dark brown sand to sandy
loam over strong brown, gray, or mottled strong
brown and gray sandy clay to clay. Two shovel
tests (2-87 and 2-98) reached 80 cm and did not
encounter the clayey subsoil. Both of these were
on slight rises above the floodplain south of
Starkey Creek. Sixteen negative tests (2-111
through 2-126) were on the nose slopes and flood-

westward across the northern part of Area 6,
joining Starkey Creek just west of the area.
A public-access road that extends east from
Fyffe Cut-Off Road delineates the north boundary. The southern portion of the western boundary follows Starkey Creek Road, and the
southern boundary borders Area 3. Most of Area
Creek (Figure 6). Light riparian woods flank
these areas, and the higher lands have been
cleared for pasture. Visibility is poor overall with
thick grass or dense leaf-fall in wooded areas.
Small clearings in the northernmost portion of
Area 5 provided slightly improved visibility. Although highly disturbed, a ca. 365x365-m bulldozed area in the southwest portion of Area 5
provided good visibility. A gas line runs east-west
across the northern portion of Area 5. Other disturbances include drainage ditches that have
been cut or eroded along the central portion of
the Starkey Creek floodplain and agricultural
terracing at the southern end of the area. Two
brick homes (built in the 1980s-1990s) and one
trailer home front Starkey Creek road along the
southwest boundary. In addition to construction
disturbance, water lines and septic tanks are

plain east of Starkey Creek in the southern portion of Area 5. These exposed 3-50 cm of brown
to grayish brown sand to sandy loam over strong
brown to yellowish brown clay or gray clay with
orange mottles. Finally, four negative tests (2137 through 2-140) were on the floodplain west
of Starkey Creek, east of Starkey Creek Road.
These exposed 12-40 cm of brown, yellowish
brown, or grayish brown sand to sandy loam over
brown or strong brown clay or gray clay with
strong brown or yellow mottles.

These tests are described under the Site Descriptions section below.
The remaining eight shovel tests were in
nonsite areas. Shovel Tests 3-40 through 3-45
were on the floodplain east of Starkey Creek.
Shovel Test 3-40 exposed 100 cm oflight brown
silty sand with no clay reached at termination.
Shovel Tests 3-41 and 3-42 exposed 20-30 cm of
brown sandy loam over light brown and yellowish brown sandy clay. Shovel Tests 3-43 and 344 were on the lowest part of the toeslope west
of 41HS850, a prehistoric site recorded in Area
5. Shovel Test 3-43 exposed 20 cm of grayish
brown loam over gray and dark reddish brown
mottled clay, and Shovel Test 3-44 exposed 20 cm
of brown sand with many small gravels over
strong brown clay. Finally, Shovel Test 3-45 exposed 75 cm of light yellowish red sandy loam
over reddish yellow clay. None of these easternmost tests recovered cultural materials.
Two tests were placed at the far southern
end of the tract in a wooded area west of Starkey
Creek. This section appears to have been disturbed, as hummocks suggest that past tributary channels have cut through the area. Shovel
Tests 3-4 7 and 3-49 exposed 20-30 cm of dark
brown and gray mottled loamy clay. No cultural
materials were recovered from these tests.

Survey Area 7
Survey Area 7 is a 55-acre tract that
stretches south from Fyffe Cut-Off Road and east
of Starkey Creek Road. A modern home and two
barns are found on the northwest portion of the
property, and a stock pond lies on the west-central edge. Starkey Creek runs along the eastern
edge of the northern portion of the property and
winds westward in the central portion. The stock
pond is a dammed tributary of Starkey Creek.
South of the stock pond is an eroded channel
that empties into Starkey Creek in the southeastern quarter of the tract. Little Starkey Creek
flows onto the property along the eastern edge
and merges with Starkey Creek in the southeast corner. A toeslope extends across the northern quarter of the tract, and the lower slopes of
a second toeslope fall just east of Starkey Creek
Road reaching into the western edge of Survey
Area 7. Starkey Creek floodplain occupies the
remaining land, falling along the northeast
boundary and bowing into the central and southeastern portions of the tract.
Visibility is poor throughout Area 7. Most of
the floodplain east of Starkey Creek is wooded
with heavy leaf-fall and tree-fall covering the
ground surface. Portions of the floodplain paralleling the tree line west of the creek have been
cleared but are grassy. The remaining land is
grassy, open pasture with the exception of a
ca. 60-m-wide swath of dense woods at the far
southern end of the tract. Cutbanks along
Starkey Creek and its tributaries provided subsurface exposures up to 4 m deep. Rodent burrows and ant mounds also provided minimal soil
exposures.
Forty-nine shovel tests were excavated in
Area 7 . Twenty-nine are on 41HS573 (3-1
through 3-21 and 3-33 through 3-39), and 13 are
on 41HS57 4 (3-22 through 3-32, 3-46, and 3-48).

Survey Area 8
Survey Area 8 is a 32-acre tract located
ca. 0.4-1.2 km east of State Highway 43. Potters
Creek defines the eastern boundary of Area 8.
The landscape encompasses the extreme lower
reaches of two toeslopes, divided by a small tributary, but Area 8 primarily is the floodplain of
Potters Creek. Potters Creek has ca. 1.5-2.0-mhigh cutbanks and deep flowing water. Old channels of Potters Creek were observed at the
northern end ofArea 8. A linear pond runs northsouth through the northern quarter of Area 8.
This may represent another former channel of
Potters Creek. Visibility is generally poor with
dense leaf-fall covering the surface. However,
excellent subsurface exposures are provided by
the cutbanks of Potters Creek and its tributaries. Additional exposures were observed in bulldozer cuts at the far southern end of Area 8.
Twenty shovel tests were excavated in Area
8. One test on 41HS852 was positive and is described below. Five tests, three of which were
positive, were placed on 41HS853 and are also

(Corbin 1993). He reported that the area had
been used as a borrow pit for the construction of
a gas well pad. The site was not recommended
for further investigation or monitoring.
The site was revisited during the current
investigations. A large borrow pit ca. 20 m in
diameter was observed along the northwest edge
of the top of the ridge, confirming Corbin's description of the site location. The area has an
overstory of older pine trees with an understory
of shrubs and grass. The ridge top is surrounded
by roads and gas pipelines. A gravel road climbs
up to the location from the south (toward
FM 2625) and veers east to a gas well pad. Two
two-track roads veer off the gravel road, one bordering the north edge of the western arm of
Survey Area 2, and the other, just to the north
outside the project area. The Amoco pipeline that
Corbin investigated in 1993 runs north of this
northern two-track road and is marked with
metal posts. A former two-track road (now completely overgrown) and a gas pipeline, also
marked with posts, extend to the north of the
proposed site location, and a second gas line runs
northeast, intersecting the other gas line ca. 30 m
north of the site location.
Seven shovel tests were excavated to see if
any of the site remains. Shovel Tests 65-71 were
placed on the southern slopes of the ridge. The
tests ranged from 5 to 60 cm deep and exposed
yellowish brown to brown sand to sandy loam
over strong brown clay, except for Shovel Test
66, which exposed strong brown clay at the surface. No cultural materials were recovered in the
shovel tests, but one flake was observed on a
two-track road. Shovel testing and surface observations confirm that 41HS536, a light prehistoric lithic scatter, was destroyed by
excavation of the borrow pit.

described below. The remaining 14 tests were
negative. Two of these were just north of an old
gas pipeline route near the middle of Area 8.
Shovel Tests 3-50 and 3-51 exposed 80-100 cm
oflight brown to light gray sand; no subsoil was
encountered, but Shovel Test 5-51 encountered
a few strong brown sandy inclusions. Three tests
were on a slight rise in the floodplain immediately west of the Potters Creek bank. Shovel
Tests 3-52 through 3-54 exposed 90-100 cm of
light brown to light gray sand. No subsoil was
encountered. Two tests were on very slight rises
in the floodplain north of a tributary that runs
east-west through the northern section of Area
8. Shovel Tests 3-58 and 3-60 exposed 42-72 cm
of dark grayish brown to gray fine sand over
strong brown sandy clay. Shovel Tests 3-57, 359, and 3-60 were at the base of a toeslope that
extends into Area 8 from the west. These exposed
37-80 cm oflight to dark gray sand with strong
brown to yellowish brown mottles or inclusions.
Clay was encountered in Shovel Tests 3-57 and
3-60. The lower deposits became moist in Shovel
Test 3-59. One test was at the base of a toeslope,
just north of the former gas line, exposing 56 cm
oflight brown sand over strong brown sandy clay.
Three tests were south of the former gas line on
the floodplain. Shovel Test 3-62 exposed 56 cm
of dark gray to yellowish red fine sandy loam;
Shovel Test 3-63 exposed 72 cm of dark gray
brown sand and was terminated at a root; and
Shovel Test 3-64 exposed 80 cm of dark brown
fine sandy loam without reaching subsoil.

SITE DESCRIPTIONS
Fourteen sites were visited during the course
of the surveys. Four are previously recorded
(41HS536, 41HS537, 41HS573, and 41HS574),
and 10 are new sites (41HS841-41HS846 and
41HS850-41HS853). Twelve are chiefly prehistoric, and 2 are mostly historic.

41HS537
Site 41HS537 is a prehistoric campsite situated on a ridge overlooking the Starkey Creek
floodplain to the west (Figure 7). Dr. James
Corbin recorded the site in 1993 while conducting an Amoco Gas pipeline survey that ran along
the ridge (Corbin 1993). Corbin did not have
access to the site, but he placed several shovel
tests on the pipeline right of way. He reported
that cultural remains were observed in disturbed
areas of this large site and indicated that the
site was occupied during the Early Ceramic

41HS536
Site 41HS536, a light prehistoric artifact
scatter, was recorded by Dr. James Corbin in 1993
(Corbin 1993). The site was plotted ca. 200 m north
of FM 2625, 2.0 km east of the intersection of
FM 2625 and State Highway 43, on a ridge overlooking Roseborough Creek to the south and
Potters Creek to the west. Corbin excavated several shovel tests, and three flakes were observed

northwest of Shovel Tests 173 and 175 and ca.
200 m west-southwest of Shovel Test 72. Here,
Shovel Tests 149, 150, and 151 define a concentration ca. 60 m in diameter on the lower ridge
slopes and yielded two sherds and five pieces of
debitage. Artifact recovery from the six positive
shovel tests combined was as follows: Level 1
(0-20 cm) produced eight ceramic sherds and
four pieces of debitage, and Level 2 (20-40 cm)
produced one sherd, three pieces of debitage, and
one fire-cracked rock. Hence, it appears that the
cultural materials are shallow, occurring mostly
in the upper 20 cm. No diagnostic lithic artifacts
were found, but the nine ceramic sherds, one of
which is brushed (the others are undecorated),
point to occupation probably during the middle
to later parts of the Caddoan period. Site
41HS537 (at least the southern and western concentrations where ceramics were found) probably is associated with the Caddoan mound
complex at 41HS15 ca. 1.4 km to the northwest.
The sparseness of the artifacts suggest it may
have functioned as a short-term campsite, although it is possible that the two areas with ceramics represent small residential hamlets.

period. The site originally was plotted on the
long, narrow, northeast-southwest ridge top extending ca. 330x30 m.
The current investigations re-located the site
and modified the boundaries. The site lies primarily in pastureland with low grasses and
sparsely scattered oak mattes. A fence divides
the southwestern portion of the site that lies in
a dense oak forest. Ground surface visibility is
fair in the pasture areas because of patchy grass,
erosion, and the excavation of a stock tank on
the midslopejust north of the site. No artifacts
were seen on the surface, however.
Twenty-one shovel tests were excavated in
the vicinity of 41HS537. Work began with placement of 7 tests on the ridge top where the TARL
map indicated Corbin's site location. Shovel Tests
72-78 exposed 25-56 cm of dark brown to yellowish brown sand over strong brown sandy clay.
Several pieces of petrified wood were found in
the upper 60 cm in these tests, but only one flake
was recovered from Shovel Test 72, Level 1 (020 cm). Three more shovel tests were placed on
the ridge top south and west of the original TARL
location. Shovel Tests 173-175 were excavated
to 15-40 cm below the surface and exposed yellowish brown to brown sand to sandy loam over
strong brown sandy clay. Two of these tests were
positive. Shovel Test 173 recovered five ceramic
sherds at 0-20 cm, and one sherd, one silicified
wood flake, and one fire-cracked rock at 2040 cm. Shovel Test 175 recovered one ceramic
sherd at 0-20 cm. Eleven additional tests were
placed on the slopes of the interfluve to the west.
Shovel Tests 146-154, 156, and 157 were excavated to 15-60 cm below the surface and exposed
dark yellowish brown to yellowish brown sand
to sandy loam over strong brown sandy clay.
Three of these tests were positive: Shovel Test
149 recovered two ceramic sherds, two pieces of
debitage, and charcoal at 0-20 cm; Shovel Test
150 recovered one piece of debitage at 20-40 cm;
and Shovel Test 151 recovered one piece of
debitage at 0-20 cm.
Based on the positive shovel tests, there are
cultural materials in three widely separated
areas at 41HS537. Shovel Test 72 on the ridge
top at the north end of the site produced one
isolated flake. Shovel Tests 173 and 175 are on
the ridge top ca. 240 m to the southwest and
define an area ca. 40 min diameter, with these
tests yielding seven sherds, one flake, and one
fire-cracked rock. The third area is ca. 17 5 m

41HS573
Site 41HS573 is a prehistoric campsite with
a minor historic component located on a western toeslope stretching down into the Starkey
Creek floodplain (Figure 8). Timothy Perttula
of the Texas Historical Commission originally
recorded the site in 1994. He received information from Bo Nelson that a Late Prehistoric farmstead was located on the toeslope in the northern
section ofArea 7. No shovel tests were excavated,
but Perttula reported that Nelson had observed
large amounts of ceramics on the surface and
that habitation and midden features were likely.
The site was estimated to be 100 m north-south
by 100 m east-west, taken from the plotting on
the quadrangle (probably based on the landform
as well as Nelson's description). At the time the
site form was completed, no impacts were perceived, but pothunting activities were considered
possible.
The current investigations included shovel
testing and modifying the site boundaries.
Twenty-nine shovel tests were placed on and
around 41HS573, 14 of which were positive. Six
tests (3-1 through 3-6) were placed in the yard
areas south of the modern house and north of a

brown sandy clay to clay. Of the six tests on this
landform, five were positive. Shovel Tests 3-11,
3-12, 3-13, 3-14, and 3-16 recovered debitage,
prehistoric sherds, and fire-cracked rocks from
the upper 40 cm. Shovel Test 3-11 produced two
flakes from Level 1 (0-20 cm). Shovel Test 3-12
contained three fire-cracked rocks (not collected).
Shovel Test 3-13 produced one flake in Level 2
(20-40 cm). Shovel Test 3-14 resulted in two
sherds (both decorated) and one flake from Level
1 (0-20 cm) and three fire-cracked rocks (not
collected). Shovel Test 3-16 produced two flakes
from Level 2 (20-40 cm).
Four tests (3-17 through 3-20) were placed
in the floodplain southeast of the toeslope. These
exposed 55-100 cm oflight yellowish brown silty
sand, and only Shovel Test 3-17 reached a reddish yellow sandy clay at 55 cm. Shovel Test 319 was the only positive test along this portion
of the floodplain, producing two sherds (one decorated) from Level 2 (20-40 cm). Shovel Test 321 was on a southward-extending ridge east of
the stock tank. The test exposed 40 cm of yellowish red sandy loam over yellowish red clay.
No cultural materials were recovered at this location.
Four shovel tests (3-32 through 3-35) were
on the southwest side of the modern structures,
west of a north-south fenceline. Shovel Test 332 exposed 70 cm of yellowish brown silty sand
with reddish brown mottles that increased with
depth. No subsoil was encountered, but water
was reached at 70 cm below the surface. Shovel
Test 3-33 reached a depth of 100 cm without
encountering the clayey subsoil. This test was
positive with two sherds found in Level 1 (020 cm), three sherds in Level 2 (20-40 cm), and
a flake and two sherds in Level 3 (40-60 cm).
Shovel Test 3-34 was placed on the lower slope
of an eastward-extending toeslope that is bisected by Starkey Creek Road; it exposed 40 cm
of brown sand over yellowish brown clay. Level
1 (0-20 cm) produced one flake and a firecracked rock (not collected). Shovel Test 3-35 was
placed west ofa barn and exposed 55 cm of yellowish brown silty sand over reddish brown
sandy clay. Two sherds and one flake were recovered from Level 1 (0-20 cm).
Finally, four shovel tests were placed on the

fenced vehicle storage lot. Shovel Test 3-1 was
west of the barn and exposed 39 cm oflight yellowish brown sand over reddish brown sandy
clay. Shovel Test 3-2 was between the house and
the barn and exposed 12 cm of compact reddish
yellow sand (probably disturbed) over 53 cm of
grayish brown silty sand with yellowish brown
mottled clay at 65 cm. A rusted fragment of metal
and a modern red brick fragment (similar to that
used in construction of the house nearby) were
found in the upper 20 cm but were not collected.
Shovel Tests 3-3 through 3-6 were in an open
area south of the barn in a rectangular mowed
area with a small modern building (probably a
well house); these tests were excavated to 6580 cm and exposed light brown to yellowish
brown silty sand over reddish yellow to yellowish red clay, except for Shovel Test 3-4 which
exposed 63 cm of yellowish brown, strong brown,
and gray mottled sandy loam over yellowish red
sandy clay. Shovel Test 3-4 was 10 m north of
the possible well house and may contain disturbed soil. Shovel Tests 3-3 and 3-4 were positive. Shovel Test 3-3 recovered a historic ceramic
sherd, possibly with a lead glaze. The glaze is
light caramel brown on the outside and dark
brownish green on the inside, and rings can be
made out on the inside of the sherd. Shovel Test
3-4 recovered a prehistoric sherd in Level 3 (4060 cm). Shovel Test 3-7 was placed east of a
north-south fence line, west of Shovel Test 3-5,
and exposed 60 cm oflight yellowish red sandy
loam over yellowish red sandy clay to clay. One
flake was recovered from Level 2 (20-40 cm).
Three tests (3-8 through 3-10) were in a
fenced vehicle storage lot east of the second barn.
Shovel Test 3-8 was positive and exposed 60 cm
of mottled light yellowish brown, strong brown,
and gray sandy loam becoming sandy clay loam
at 60-70 cm below the surface with yellowish
brown sandy clay at 70 cm. One prehistoric ceramic sherd was recovered from Level 2 (2040 cm). Shovel Tests 3-9 and 3-10 were negative
and exposed 70-75 cm oflight yellowish red to
reddish brown silty sand over yellowish red to
reddish brown sandy clay.
Six tests (3-11through3-16) were placed on
the southeastern edge of the toeslope on a flat
area just northwest of a significant drop-off to
the Starkey Creek floodplain. These tests encountered clay or sandy clay at depths ranging
from 18 to 36 cm in Shovel Tests 3-11and3-14
on the far southwest side of the landform, in17

I

northeastern side of the ridge, northeast of the
modern house. Shovel Test 3-36 exposed 38 cm
oflight yellowish red sandy loam over yellowish
red clay. One sherd was recovered from Level 1
(0-20 cm). Shovel Test 3-37 exposed 42 cm of
yellowish brown silty sand over reddish brown
sandy clay with sandstone gravels common below 30 cm. No cultural materials were recovered.
Shovel Test 3-38 reached a depth of 80 cm without encountering the clayey subsoil, however,
ironstone gravels increased with depth. Modern
glass (one clear and one brown piece) and
charred nutshells were recovered in the upper
20 cm. Shovel Test 3-39 was placed in an open
yard in front of the house. The test reached a
depth of 100 cm and did not encounter the clay
subsoil. No cultural materials were recovered.
Based on the positive shovel tests and landforms, the site measures ca. 300 m northwestsoutheast by 190 m southwest-northeast, although in reality it may be continuous with
41HS574 to the south. Sites 41HS573 and
41HS574 (described below) were originally recorded prior to field inspection or shovel testing, and arbitrary site boundaries were
established. Prehistoric artifact recovery was
relatively consistent across the site. Debitage,
ceramics, and to a lesser extent fire-cracked
rocks were recovered from Levels 1and2 (0-20
and 20-40 cm) with only minimal materials recovered from Level 3 (40-60 cm). Prehistoric
artifacts recovered from 41HS573 total 10 flakes,
18 sherds, 6 fire-cracked rocks, and charred nutshells. The vertical artifact distribution breaks
down as follows: Level 1 produced 5 flakes, 7
sherds, 3 fire-cracked rocks, and charred nutshells; Level 2 produced 4 flakes and 8 sherds;
and Level 3 produced 1 flake and 3 sherds. No
diagnostic lithic artifacts were found, but the 18
ceramic sherds (5 brushed, 3 engraved, 3 incised,
2 ridged, and the rest undecorated) point to occupation during the middle to late Caddoan period. This site almost certainly is associated with
the mound complex at 41HS15 immediately
across Starkey Creek Road to the southwest and
probably contains the remains of a residential
hamlet or small village.
Minimal historic and modern materials also
were encountered at 41HS573, all within the
upper 20 cm. Rusted metal pieces and a modern
brick fragment were found in Shovel Test 3-2
behind the modern house. One historic greenglazed ceramic sherd was recovered from Shovel

Test 3-3, located southeast of the house and
south of a barn. And modern glass was found in
Shovel Test 3-38 on the uplands just south of
Fyffe Cut-Off Road. The single green-glazed
sherd may represent a premodern historic component, but materials are so sparse it is hard to
be sure.

41HS574
Like 41HS573, 41HS574 was recorded by
Timothy Perttula in 1994 using information provided by Bo Nelson. The site, later called the
Coleman Farm site, was described as a Late Prehistoric to historic Caddo cemetery and probable farmstead located on a ridge immediately
overlooking Starkey Creek (see Figure 8). The
site was estimated to have been 250 by 50 m
based on the landform. At that time, looting, including the destruction of several Indian burials, had been conducted "by a well-known
pothunter" and ceramic vessels, possibly engraved, were with one of the burials. Based on
this, Perttula suggested that the site has a historic Caddo component. Additional pothunting
was listed on the site form as a perceived future
impact.
Several years later, Perttula ·and Nelson
(1997) published a short article in the Journal
ofNortheast Texas Archaeology describing artifacts collected from the surface of 41HS574 by
local avocational archeologist Marshall Mcintosh in late 1994. That analysis identified a
Perdiz arrow point fragment, 159 pieces oflithic
debitage, 2 tested cobbles, 5 cores, 111 ceramic
sherds, 2 pieces of daub with stick impressions,
3 pieces of animal bone, and 2 human skull fragments. The sherd collection was made up of 4 7
percent plain and 53 percent decorated pieces
with decorative techniques including brushing,
punctating, engraving, incising, and appliqueing.
Based on the ceramics, Perttula and Nelson concluded that the site dates to the late part of the
middle Caddoan period, with the array of artifacts (including daub) indicating that it is a residential occupation site. In addition, they
reported that a looted pot had been identified
as a Natchitoches Engraved vessel, indicating
that at least one of the looted graves could be
historic Caddo.
The current investigations included shovel
testing, modifying the site boundaries, and recording the area disturbed by looters. Twelve

on the lowest slope of an eastward-extending
toeslope that is bisected by Starkey Creek Road.
Shovel Tests 3-24 and 3-25 exposed 40-45 cm of
brown to yellowish brown sand over yellowish
brown sandy clay. Shovel Test 3-26 was similar
but encountered impenetrable rocks at 40 cm
below the surface. The three tests were positive
with materials recovered from the upper 20 cm.
Two sherds, one brushed and one plain, were
recovered from Shovel Test 3-24. One flake was
recovered from Shovel Test 3-25. And one flake
and one sherd were found in Shovel Test 3-26.
Five tests were placed in an open field south
and east of a trailer house, east of Starkey Creek
Road. Shovel Tests 3-27 through 3-31 varied in
depth from 25 to 90 cm; all reached the clayey
subsoil. Shovel Test 3-27 reached a depth of
90 cm and produced one silicified wood flake and
one dart point from Level 4 (60-80 cm). Shovel
Test 3-28 reached 50 cm in depth and produced
one flake from Level 1 (0-20 cm). Shovel Test 329 reached only 25 cm in depth and was negative. Shovel Test 3-30 was excavated to 55 cm
before reaching the clayey subsoil and produced
two flakes and three fire-cracked rocks (not collected) from the upper 20 cm. Shovel Test 3-31
reached a depth of 40 cm and was negative.
Finally, two tests (3-46 and 3-48) were placed
in a wooded swath of land at the far southern
end of Area 7. This area has hummocks that may
be parts of remnant channels from a tributary
dammed on the west side of Starkey Creek Road.
Shovel Test 3-46 exposed 82 cm of pinkish brown
silty sand over brown sandy clay. One flake was
recovered from the upper 20 cm. Shovel Test 348 exposed 100 cm oflight brown silty sand with
reddish brown mottles appearing in the lower
60 cm. The clayey subsoil was not reached, and
no cultural materials were produced.
Prehistoric materials from 41HS573 total 11
flakes, 10 sherds, 4 fire-cracked rocks, and 1 dart
point, all of which were recovered from the upper 20 cm except for 1 flake and the dart point
found at 60-80 cm in Shovel Test 3-27. The dart
point is a small, complete, untypeable specimen
made from reddish brown chert with a remnant
of tan cortex on one face. It has a short (O. 7 cm),
expanding (from 1.3 to 1. 7 cm) stem with a convex base and unground edges. The 2.9-cm-long
blade has weak shoulders (2.0 cm wide) and gently convex margins. Given its form and depth, it
probably represents a sparse Archaic component
that may be restricted to the southern part of

shovel tests were excavated at 41HS574, 9 of
which were positive. These investigations defined the site as extending 390 m north-south
by 160 m east-west (see Figure 8). Starkey Creek
defines the eastern site boundary. The northern
tip of the site lies on the southward-extending
toeslope that 41HS573 to the north occupies. A
spring-fed tributary heads northwest of the site
and flows under Starkey Creek Road into a
dammed stock tank between 41HS57 4 and
41HS573. The drainage exiting this tank flows
south across the north part of 41HS57 4 and then
east across the central part before draining into
Starkey Creek along the southeastern edge of
the site. A second, southern tributary once flowed
from springs that erupt ca. 400 m west of the
site. That tributary is now dammed immediately
west of Starkey Creek Road, but faint channel
scars can be made out in the woods at the far
southern end of the site. Most of the site is open
pasture, with riparian woods along Starkey
Creek and the tributary that crosses the northern part of the site and on the floodplain at the
south end of the site.
Based on information provided by Marshall
Mcintosh and surface evidence, the area that
had been bulldozed during looting of graves was
identified in the east-central part of the site. This
area, measuring ca. 80 m north-south by 60 m
east-west, is at the south end of the toeslope east
of the northern tributary and west of Starkey
Creek. Apparently, bulldozing activity was concentrated in the center of this elevated area,
leaving what now appears to be a depression
with higher edges (the remainder of the original slope) along the south and the west. These
also could represent backdirt piles that have
since sloped to a more natural contour. This area
was not shovel tested due to the extensive disturbance, although it is possible that some intact areas may remain along Starkey Creek and
along the southern and western edges of the
original knoll.
Two shovel tests (3-22 and 3-23) were placed
on a southward-extending ridge, southeast of the
stock pond. Both were positive and exposed
20 cm of brown sand over yellowish brown clay.
Shovel Test 3-22 produced two flakes and one
sherd (an incised rim) in the upper 20 cm, and
Shovel Test 3-23 produced one flake and six
sherds (two decorated, two brushed, and two
plain).
Three tests (3-24 through 3-26) were placed

barbed wire scraps). A modern carport lies ca. 10 m
east of the house.
The remains of a second structure lie ca. 30 m
west of main house, ca. 15 m west of the fenced
yard. A barn or abandoned structure appears in
this location on the 1983 USGS topographic map.
A ca. l.5xl.8-m footing represents the only remains of this structure. The footing is made of
one course of large cut ironstones covered with
four courses of machine-made red bricks. This
may represent the remains of a stoop or possibly a chimney base. The remains of the structure are beneath a large pile of modern debris.
Charcoal and burned debris around the feature
suggest that the structure burned, or burning
may have occurred after the structure collapsed.
The age of this structure is unclear, but it probably dates to the twentieth century.
Visibility is fair across the site with low
patchy grass throughout the yard and adjacent
property. The surface is littered with modern and
historic trash, and several burn piles are scattered across the site. Trash has been brought
onto the site (for example, that were piled on
the remains of the second structure), and there

the site. The 10 ceramic sherds (3 brushed, 2
ridged, 1 incised, and 4 plain), as well as the
materials from the 1994 surface collection analyzed by Perttula and Nelson, indicate that the
site was occupied in the middle to late Caddoan
period. This site probably contains the remains
of a residential hamlet or small village associated with the mound complex at 41HS15 just
across Starkey Creek Road to the west, and the
looted cemetery may represent later use for
mortuary purposes.
41HS841

Site 41HS841 is a twentieth-century
housesite ca. 2.4 km south of Interstate Highway 20 on the southeast corner of the intersection of State Highway 43 and Fyffe Cut-Off Road.
It occupies a ridge top overlooking the Potters
Creek floodplain to the south and west. The site
contains a single-story, frame house probably
built in the 1930s, with possibly as many as five
additions that appear to have been erected up
to the 1980s (Figure 9). The yard is fenced with
makeshift fencing (including chainlink and

FM 2625, ca. 2.5 km east of its intersection with
State Highway 43. The site is on a ridge top 100200 m north of Roseborough Creek and 1.0 km
east of Potters Creek. Cultural materials were
found in two adjacent tracts: a western cleared
pasture with low grass and a few sparsely
planted pine trees and an eastern pasture with
thick grass, one large hackberry tree, and several clumps of evergreens. The tracts are separated by a barbed-wire fence running
north-south. Overall, ground surface visibility
is poor because of the dense grass.
The site measures ca. 140 m east-west by
70 m north-south and includes one extant barn
(Figure 10), the remains of a livestock chute, and
subsurface remains of a second structure. The
one-story, single-gable, ca. 7x4-m barn lies on the
east side of the site. The barn is constructed of
miscellaneous materials including hand-adzed
timber, milled wood, railroad ties, and modern
lumber. The exterior walls are covered with 4x8ft sheets of corrugated metal. The northern exterior wall has been repaired with large patches
of ca. 10x8-ft wooden billboards advertising
"Photo Processing 23¢/print" ... "Oklahoma." A

is no way to determine if the materials found
here are associated with the occupation of these
structures.
Six shovel tests (13-18) were placed on the
site, ranging from 18 to 55 cm in depth. All shovel
tests were positive. Artifacts including modern
glass, modern trash (metal scraps and plastic),
a whiteware sherd, and a brown ceramic sherd
or sewer pipe fragment were observed in the
upper 20 cm. No artifacts were collected from
these shovel tests because the debris appears to
have been brought into the site area, dumped,
and scattered.
All evidence indicates that 41HS841 is a
twentieth-century housesite. No artifacts were
found to suggest an earlier occupation, and the
extant house probably dates to the 1930s. The
house has been extensively remodeled.

sherds have makers' marks. One reads "WA I
_OYAL IRO..."with a royal arms insignia below. The second has part of a faint, fine-lined,
undecipherable insignia. Artifacts from Level
2 (20-40 cm) consist of 2 pieces of debitage, 8
small brick fragments, 2 nail fragments (possibly cut) and an unidentified piece of metal
(possibly a nail or piece of wire), 1 four-hole
milk glass button fragments, 1 piece of olive
green glass, 1 piece of clear bottle glass, and
1 piece of charcoal.
The brick fragments are from handmade
clay bricks that appear to be the subsurface remains of footings of a structure. In addition to
the intact footing found in Shovel Test 102, brick
fragments representing displaced footings were
found in Shovel Tests 99, 100, 103, 104, 106, and
235. Larger pieces indicate that these probably
were large bricks, estimated to be ca. 8x4 inches.
The many smaller pieces probably are a result
of plowing or decomposition. Based on the size
of the rise, the structure may have covered an
area of ca. lOxlO m.
The presence of window glass, whiteware
sherds, and a button suggest that this structure
served as a house. Based on the presence of
handmade bricks, cut nails, and solarized glass,
it appears that the house may date to the nineteenth century, although the presence of wire
nails indicates that it continued to be used into
the twentieth century. Neither of the ceramic
sherds recovered can be dated with certainty,
but marks similar to the one incorporating the
royal arms insignia (i.e., a royal arms with ''Royal
Ironstone" above) were used by at least seven
British and American potteries in the late nineteenth century and into the early twentieth century: Wheeling Pottery Co. ( 1880-1886 ); Mellor,
Taylor and Co. (1880-1904); Johnson Bros.
(1883-1913); A. J. Wilkinson, Ltd. (1885-1896);
Alfred Meakin, Ltd. (1897+); East End Pottery
Co. (1894-1907); and Steubenville Pottery Co.
(1900+) (Godden 1991; Kovel and Kovel 1985;
Lehner 1988). The barn and livestock chute postdate the house and may have been constructed
after the house was removed or collapsed.
Shovel Tests 103 yielded a single piece of
lithic debitage from Level 1 (0-20 cm), and
Shovel Test 2-146 yielded one piece from Level
1 and two from Level 2 (20-40 cm). This prehistoric component appears to be a very sparse
lithic scatter with only four pieces of debitage
found in the upper 40 cm.

construction date for this barn is difficult to determine because the construction materials are
a mishmash, but it may have been built between
the 1930s and 1950s. A dilapidated wooden cattle
chute just east of the fence line that separates
the two tracts also appears to date to the midtwentieth century. The subsurface remains of a
second building (probably footings) were identified on the eastern tract ca. 45 m west of the
extant barn and ca. 10 m east of the livestock
chute on a low rise during shovel testing. No
cultural features or structural remains were
found on the western tract.
The site was investigated during two phases
of survey work. Twelve shovel tests (99, 100, 102104, 106, 235, 238, 241, 244, 246, and 247) were
placed on the east side of the site during the
first phase of the survey. An additional 8 shovel
tests (2-141 through 2-148) were excavated on
the west side of the site after land access was
secured. The tests reached 18-52 cm in depth
and exposed dark yellowish brown to brown sand
to sandy loam over strong brown sandy clay to
clay loam, except Shovel Test 102, which encountered a large, intact historic brick footing 18 cm
below the surface. Ten tests contained historic
materials: Shovel Tests 99, 100, 102-104, 106,
and 235 were excavated during the first phase
of survey work; and Shovel Tests 2-141, 2-142,
and 2-146 were dug during the second phase.
Historic artifacts are concentrated on or immediately around the low rise and are lightly scattered ca. 60 m to the east and ca. 70 m to the
west. Historic artifacts were recovered in the
upper 40 cm but were concentrated in the upper 20 cm. Lithic debitage was found in two
shovel tests: Shovel Test 103 situated on the east
side of the small rise and Shovel Test 2-146
ca. 75 m to the west.
Artifacts recovered in Level 1 (0-20 cm) consist of2 pieces of debitage, 64 historic brick fragments, 1 small glazed brick fragment, 6
whiteware sherds, 4 cut nails, 2 wire nails, 2
unidentifiable shanks, 1 galvanized nail, 1 piece
of scrap metal, 1 clinker (coal residue), 3 solarized glass fragments (1 decorative, 1 bottle, and
1 flat), 1 piece of milk glass, 5 pieces of clear
window glass, 2 brown glass fragments (1 medicine bottle and 1 flat), 7 clear bottle glass fragments, 1 piece of aqua glass, 1 piece of olive green
glass, 1 small bone fragment, and 1 piece of charcoal. The brick fragments range from very small
(pea sized) to large (8xll cm). Two ceramic

trict Court Case File 1032). Walling's name also
was associated with an early road through the
project area-the Wallings Ferry Road-itself
roughly equivalent to the later ShreveportCamden Road and present-day FM 2625. Laid
out by 1844 (Freeman 1978:34-35), the Wallings
Ferry Road ran generally east-west and bordered
41HS842 on the south.
In January 1860, when Jesse and Ann Walling were living in Rusk County, they sold approximately 1,000 acres out of the Patterson
one-third league to John J. Harvey of Harrison
County for $2,500. The land lay south of a 200acre tract that Walling had sold to James F.
Rosborough (also spelled Roseborough) in
December 1848 in the northeast corner of the
Patterson grant. According to records in the
Rosborough Family Vertical File at the Harrison
County Historical Museum, James Fears
Rosborough was a native of South Carolina who
immigrated to Texas in about 1839 and settled
on a large plantation about 3 miles north of
Marshall in the 1840s. He sold the property
and settled permanently ca. 7 miles south of
Marshall, probably east of the Patterson Survey, where he died on July 30, 1861. Harvey's
1,000 acres partly bordered the Wallings Ferry
Road which ran generally east-west (Harrison
County Deed Record M:14; S:259-260).
Harvey held the property for only 11 months,
during which time he appears to have been
living in or near Marshall, and then sold it to
W. J. Rosborough of Harrison County on November 10, 1860, for $4,000 (Harrison County
Deed Record S:653-643; U.S. Bureau of the
Census 1860).
Wyatt Jarrus Rosborough, the son of James
Fears Rosborough who owned the adjoining 200
acres to the north of 41HS842 and additional
acreage in the area, was born in South Carolina
in 1833 and married Ilby Yancy Craig (18381919), a native ofTennessee. The couple had four
sons and one or two daughters: James Fears
Rosborough, born October 22, 1856; Eli Taylor
Rosborough, born May 20, 1857; Ida Rosborough,
born ca. 1860; Wyatt J. Rosborough, born 1863;
and William Rosborough, born March 28, 1866
(Rosborough Family Vertical File. Harrison
County Historical Museum; U.S. Bureau of the
Census 1880).
Between 1861 and the early 1870s, ad valorem tax records suggest that the Rosborough
family was living on their 1,000 acres in the John

Site 41HS842 is located on Tracts 1017-013
and 1017-014 (as designated by the Sabine Mine)
in the east-central portion of the John Patterson
Grant, a survey of one-third league, or approximately 1,476.13 acres (Figure 11).Accordingto
a character certificate signed in Nacogdoches on
October 9, 1835, Patterson was "a single man of
good character and Christian religion without
family," who had come to the Department of
Nacogdoches in 1830. On October 13, 1835, land
office commissioner George W Smyth authorized
a survey for Patterson, and William Brookfield
subsequently surveyed the one-third league. He
signed the survey document in Nacogdoches on
October 28 and swore that the grant was comprised of one labor of arable land and the balance pasture. All of it was suitable for grazing
(Texas. General Land Office. Spanish Archives:80:21; 90:36; English Field Notes; Translation #2977).
According to General Land Office records,
Patterson's agent was Jesse Walling (17941867), a native of Tennessee who served under
General William Henry Harrison during an Indian campaign in Indiana. He moved to
Covington County, Mississippi, where he held
public offices, and then to west Tennessee in
1825. He immigrated to San Augustine, Texas,
in December 1834 and settled in Nacogdoches
in 1835 (Cutrer 1996), when his name appeared
on John Patterson's land records.
On November 10, 1835, Patterson sold his
one-third league to Jesse Walling (Harrison
County Deed Record 33:94-95). According to
Cutrer (1996), Walling participated in the battle
of San Jacinto and then returned to Nacogdoches
where he married Mrs. Ann Wheelock in 1838.
He was elected justice of the peace and operated a cotton gin, then moved to Shelby County
by 1840. He must have moved back to
Nacogdoches by 1842 because he was elected
representative to the Seventh Congress from
Nacogdoches County. Cutrer (1996) maintains
that, after 1843, Walling was associated with
Rusk County until at least 1858. However,
Harrison County district court records show that
he was a party to at least 15 lawsuits during the

sisted of 36 acres and was set aside to B. J.
McClellan (Harrison County Deed Record
201:309-313).
A C. D. McClellan and his wife held the 36acre share of the McClellan farm until September
1934, by which time they were living in Coahoma
County, Mississippi. They then sold the property
to Emanuel M. Griggs, who was married to AC. D.
McClellan's sister, Sarah McClellan Griggs
(Harrison County Deed Record 199: 194). Griggs
was a relatively wealthy individual who was
born in Red River County, Texas, in about 1865.
Before moving to Harrison County, he lived in
Palestine, Texas. There, with partners B. F. White
and S. J. Williamson, he started a "colored bank"
named Farmers and Citizens Savings. By the
time of his death in Marshall on April 26, 1936,
McClellan owned shares in the Palestine bank
and real estate in Lawton, Eufala, and Langston,
Oklahoma; and Van Horn, Houston, Palestine,
and Marshall, Texas (Harrison County Death
Certificate: Reverend Emanuel M. Griggs;
Harrison County Probate Minutes 13:416-423).
Ad valorem tax records indicate that he lived in
Marshall at 107 Bishop Street.
Griggs's property was inherited by his wife,
Sarah Annie McClellan Griggs, and their two
children, Earl Griggs and Ethel Griggs (Harrison
County Probate Minutes 13:416-423). Sarah
then died in about 1948, and the property went
to Earl Griggs and Ethel Griggs. In about 1970,
Earl died and his one-half interest in Block 8
was inherited by his widow, Adelle Griggs, and
their three children-Larry, Allan (also spelled
Allen), and Earl Matthew, Jr.-all of whom were
living in Chicago. Six years later, Ethel Griggs,
then living in Orleans Parish, Louisiana, sold
her undivided interest in Block 8 to her sisterin-law and her brother's children (Harrison
County Deed Record 787:200-201;872:587). The
36-acre tract then remained in the possession
ofAdelle, Earl Matthew, Jr., William Monroe, and
Larry Allan Griggs until April 10, 1989, when
they sold 10.067 acres (present-day Tract 101713) north of FM 2625 to Carl Cooper of Marshall,
Texas (Harrison County Deed Record 1212:337338).
B. J. McClellan and his wife, Carrie G., held
the 36-acre Block 9 of the 300-acre McClellan
farm until February 13, 1947, at which time they
were living in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They
then sold the property to B. J.'s brother, E. J.
McClellan, for $600 (Harrison County Deed

Patterson Survey and that it was improved. The
acreage was valued variously at $2,000 to more
than $4,000, and Rosborough owned as many
as 13 slaves worth $6,500 as well as a modest
number of horses, cattle, and sheep. Sometime
after the mid-1870s, however, the family moved
to Marshall, where they were living in 1880 in
the Fourth Ward. There, Wyatt J. Rosborough
and his son, James, were merchants (U.S. Bureau
of the Census 1880).
On January 29, 1884, Rosborough and his
wife sold 300 acres of the Patterson Survey to
John McClellan (also spelled McClelland,
McClendon) for $200 cash and three promissory
notes totaling $1,000 (Harrison County Deed
Record 18:343-344). The tract included the area
of 41HS842 and ran east-west on both sides of
present-day FM 2625 (see Figure 11). Potters
Creek was near the western border. McClellan,
a prosperous freedman who also owned 158 acres
in the John Fridge Survey and 70 acres in the
P. Whetstone Survey in 1884, was born in
Alabama in 1845. He was married to Catherine
McClellan, also born in Alabama in 1848. The
couple married in about 1867, and they eventually became parents to 10 children: W. H., E. J.,
J. V., U. S., D. W., A. C. D., B. J., and John
McClellan Jr.; Sarah McClellan (who marred
E. M. Griggs); and Katie McClellan (whose married name was Bussy). John was educated, having attended school and being able to read and
write, but Catherine was illiterate. Ad valorem
tax records suggest that McClellan made a living by farming, and that he was involved in
manufacturing as well, owning a steam engine
and boilers, and manufacturing tools.
By 1900, McClellan owned his farm free of
debt, and at least one son-John W, Jr.-lived
nearby with his family (U.S. Bureau of the
Census 1900). By 1915, John McClellan Sr. had
died, but his 300-acre farm remained intact until the early 1930s, when his nine surviving children and four grandchildren, the last being the
survivors of his deceased son, John McClellan
Jr., decided to divide the property. The heirs partitioned the property in 1932, and it was divided
into blocks or shares. Block 8 (present-day tracts
1017-013and1017-019), which is the location of
the western portion of 41HS842 (see Figure
11), consisted of 36 acres and was set aside to
A C. D. McClellan. Block 9 (present-day tracts
1017-014 and 1017-26), which is the eastern,
main portion of 41HS842 (see Figure 11), con25

Record 311:541-542). E . J. and his wife, Nancy,
of Harrison County held the property until
October 29, 1958, when they sold the 36 acres
to Richard Rosborough (Harrison County Deed
Record 517:336-337).
Richard Rosborough died on May 14, 1975,
leaving a daughter, Vivian Rosborough Hines
(born ca. 1922), who was a resident of Dallas.
His estate consisted of Block 9 (36 acres), approximately 600 additional acres in Harrison
County, 16 rent houses and 4 lots in Marshall, a
frame residence, and personal property, all of
which went to his daughter (Harrison County
Deed Record 870:362; Harrison County Probate
File No. 8651). Mrs. Hines held the property for
several years and then deeded one-quarter interests to each of three relatives: Connie
Rosborough Davis of Dallas County; Bernice
Rosborough Stewart of Sacramento, California;
and Richard Rosborough, III (Harrison County
Deed Record 870:364-418). In 1982, Bernice
Rosborough Stewart, Vivian Rosborough Hines,
and Connie Rosborough Davis deeded 11.25
acres (present-day Tract 1017-14) north ofFM 2625
in Block 9 (the location of the east portion of
41HS842) to the widow (Mattie B. Williams
Rosborough) and three children of Richard
Rosborough III (Clay Rosborough, Glenda Faye
Rosborough Holland, and Michael Rosborough)
(Harrison County Deed Record 976:872-87 4).
These individuals then deeded the 11.25 acres
to Connie Rosborough Davis on December 5,
1984 (Harrison County Deed Record 1058:289291).
In sum, 41HS842 is located in the east-central portion of the John Patterson Survey, a onethird league Mexican grant. Improvements were
constructed on a portion of the grant by the late
1840s by Jesse Walling, who built a mill on
Potters Creek. Walling may have lived on the
Patterson Survey ca. 1845, when he paid taxes
on the land, 1 slave, and 36 cattle. However, the
locations of improvements associated with his
ownership are unknown, and he is more commonly associated with land and a residence in
Rusk County. The land on which 41HS842 is located was owned between 1861and1884 by a
prominent Harrison County planting and mercantile family headed by Wyatt Jarrus
Rosborough. The Rosborough family operated a
plantation on the tract, but they no longer lived
there after the mid-1870s, and the locations of
their improvements also could not be docu-

mented from available records.
A tract of 300 acres was owned and occupied by the John McClellan family between 1884
and the early 1930s. The combined archival and
archeological evidence suggests that McClellan,
a prosperous and entrepreneurial freedman,
likely occupied 41HS842 between 1884 and his
death in ca. 1914. Thereafter, the site may have
been occupied by one or more descendants until
1932, when the 300-acre McClellan farm was
partitioned. Records suggest that no part of the
two smaller parcels on which 41HS842 is located
was occupied by descendants of McClellan or
subsequent owners after the 1930s, most of
whom lived outside of Harrison County and
Texas.

41HS843
Site 41HS843 is a prehistoric occupation site
on a small (ca. 20-30 m in diameter) rise on the
east edge of the Starkey Creek floodplain, less
than 10 m from the base of the upland slope (see
Figure 7). The site lies in an open, grassy pasture with poor ground surface visibility (10-30
percent); no artifacts were found on the surface.
Six shovel tests (155, 158, and 160-163) were
excavated, three of which were positive (155, 161,
and 162). The tests ranged from 80 to 100 cm in
depth and exposed brown to yellowish brown
sand to sandy loam over strong brown or gray
sandy loam mottled with strong brown clay loam.
None of the tests reached a strong brown clay
subsoil, although several did become increasingly moist from 80 to 100 cm.
Artifacts were recovered from 0 to 60 cm
below the surface, with most coming from 040 cm. Artifacts recovered in Level 1 (0-20 cm)
were five ceramic sherds and two pieces of
debitage. Artifacts from Level 2 (20-40 cm) were
two ceramic sherds and three flakes. Level 3 (4060 cm) produced one small ceramic sherd. No
diagnostic lithic artifacts were found, but the
eight ceramic sherds, one of which is a brushed
and punctated rim (the others are undecorated),
point to occupation during the middle to late
Caddoan period. Site 41HS843 probably is associated with the Caddoan mound complex at
41HS15 ca. 1.3 km to the northwest. The sparseness of the artifacts and the small size of the
site suggest that it may have functioned as a
short-term campsite rather than as a residential hamlet or village.

encounter a strong brown sandy clay subsoil.
Artifacts were recovered from 0 to 80 cm
below the surface. Unlike 41HS843 and
41HS844 nearby, no ceramics were found at
41HS845. One small biface fragment and three
pieces of debitage were recovered from Level 1
(0-20 cm). Level 2 (20-40 cm) produced four
pieces of debitage. Level 3 (40-60 cm) produced
three fire-cracked rocks and a carbonized nutshell. One piece of debitage was recovered from
Level 4 (60-80 cm). No diagnostic artifacts were
found, and thus it is difficult to assess the site
temporally. The lack of ceramics suggests that
it may not be associated with the mound complex at 41HS15, though.

41HS844
Site 41HS844 is a prehistoric occupation site
situated on the lower slope of an interfluvial
ridge that extends from the northeast onto the
floodplain of Starkey Creek (see Figure 7). The
site is ca. 150 m northeast-southwest by 50 m
northwest-southeast. The site lies in an open,
grassy pasture with poor visibility (10-30 percent); no artifacts were seen on the surface. Eight
shovel tests (164-171) were excavated, five of
which were positive (164, 165, 168, 169, and 171).
The tests ranged from 72 to 100 cm in depth
and exposed brown to yellowish brown sand over
mottled brown loam or strong brown to sandy
clay. Only Shovel Tests 164 and 167 reached a
strong brown clay subsoil at ca. 100 cm.
Artifacts were recovered from 0 to 80 cm
below the surface. One ceramic sherd was recovered from Level 1 (0-20 cm). Level 2 (20-40 cm)
produced 6 ceramic sherds, 2 of which have incised lines, and 1 of which is brushed. Level 3
(40-60 cm) produced 4 ceramic sherds, 1 of which
is brushed and 1 of which is a rim. Two pieces of
debitage, 1 burned rock, and charcoal granules
also were recovered from Level 3. Two pieces of
fire-cracked rock were recovered in Level 4 (6080 cm). No diagnostic lithic artifacts were found,
but the 13 ceramic sherds-2 of which are
brushed-point to occupation during the middle
to late Caddoan period. Site 41HS844 probably
is associated with the Caddoan mound complex
at 41HS15 ca. 1.2 km to the northwest. The
sparseness of the artifacts may suggest that it
functioned as a short-term campsite, although
its relatively large size and the variety of materials could indicate residential use as a small
hamlet.

41HS846
Site 41HS846 is a large prehistoric site on a
terrace running along the north and west sides
of a bend in Starkey Creek (Figure 12). The site
spans ca. 360 m north-south by 160 m east-west.
Visibility is generally poor in wooded areas
flanking the creek and fence lines, in open grassy
areas, and in two residential yards. Excellent
visibility was provided by three large, plowed
gardens. Thirty-two shovel tests were excavated
on and around 41HS846, 14 of which were positive. The tests ranged from 20 to 100 cm in depth
and generally exposed yellowish brown to brown
sand to sandy loam over strong brown, yellowish brown, or mottled strong brown and gray clay.
Several shovel tests did not reach the strong
brown sandy clay subsoil, as described below.
Cultural materials were found to be distributed
widely but in apparently low densities across this
large site. Because the site is large, appears to
contain important archeological deposits, and
has a variety of modern disturbances, it merits
detailed description. Also, valuable information
was obtained from the landowner, an educated
artifact collector, that aids in understanding the
site.
Starkey Creek Road, a narrow, privately
maintained black top, curves through 41HS846,
crossing the southern half of the site. A drainage ditch is just beyond the northern boundary
of the site. Two trailer homes sit south of the
ditch, with water lines and septic tanks associated. A large disturbed area ca. 130-160 m in
diameter lies to the west of the road, west of the
central portion of the site. Here, a vacant trailer
house rests on a distinct elevated rise. Two other

41HS845
Site 41HS845 is a prehistoric occupation site
located on a small rise ca. 20 m in diameter on
the Starkey Creek floodplain (see Figure 7). The
site lies in an open, grassy pasture with poor
visibility (10-30 percent); no artifacts were seen
on the surface. Six shovel tests (107-111 and
172) were excavated; Shovel Tests 107, 111, and
172 produced cultural materials. The tests
reached depths of 35-100 cm and exposed yellowish brown to dark yellowish brown sand.
Shovel Test 111 reached a dark yellowish brown
sandy clay at 35 cm, but the other tests did not

2 (20-40 cm); and one ceramic sherd from Level
4 (60-80 cm). No artifacts were found in Shovel
Tests 218-220 placed on the lower eastern portion of the terrace. Strong brown, gray, or gray
and strong brown mottled clay was observed 4560 cm below the surface in all of these tests except Shovel Test 214, which was excavated to
100 cm without encountering clay.
Moving northward, a large brick home lies
on the east side of Starkey Creek Road. A maintained yard extends to the road, a driveway runs
along the south end of the house, and a fenced
yard with an in-ground swimming pool and patio is behind the house. Two small outbuildings
and a well house lie to the north and east of the
house. The owner, James Fyffe, reported that the
yard in front of the house had been disturbed
extensively when it was used as a dump for
trash, household items, and construction debris
by a previous occupant. Fyffe also reported that
bulky items (furniture, appliances, etc.) had been
bulldozed into a large pit measuring ca. 20 m
long, 3.5 m wide, and 5.5 m deep southwest of a
pecan tree at the east end of the driveway to the
house.
Two large gardens lie north of the Fyffe
home. Measuring ca. 110x45 and 105x20 m, the
gardens provided large expanses of excellent
surface visibility. Five flakes were observed on
the surface of the western garden, and six flakes
were observed in the narrower eastern garden.
No ceramic sherds were seen, but Fyffe has a
collection of hundreds of sherds, most of which
reportedly came from these garden areas. Inspection of this collection indicates that it consists mostly of plain and brushed sherds. Fyffe
also has a number of arrow points, predominantly Perdiz, that he collected from these areas. Nine shovel tests were excavated in the
garden areas, exposing 39-75 cm of sand to
sandy loam over strong brown to light brown
sandy clay to clay in seven of the nine tests.
Shovel Tests 226 and 229 were excavated to 90
and 70 cm and encountered light brown sandy
loam to sandy clay over clay loam or hematite
gravels. Artifacts were recovered from three of
the nine tests. Shovel Test 224 recovered one
flake and one ceramic sherd from Level 1 (0-20 cm),
and Shovel Tests 225 and 228 each recovered
one flake in Level 1 (0-20 cm). Northofthewestern garden, just south of the boundary of Survey Area 3, is a trailer pad and associated
driveway.

small rises lie north and northeast of the trailer.
There is a small, deep trash disposal pit southeast of the trailer. Six shovel tests were placed
in this area. No cultural materials were observed, however, and the tests were abandoned
when it was determined that the landscape had
been mechanically modified. Judging by the degree of disturbance and the apparent lack of
artifacts, it is likely that the three rises in this
area reflect these modern landscape modifications rather than natural rises or constructed
prehistoric mounds.
A stock tank ca. 50 m in diameter and a
ca. 45x20-m plowed garden are east of the disturbed area on the west side of Starkey Creek
Road. Two flakes were observed on the surface
of the garden. Shovel Test 231 was placed between the garden and the stock tank; no cultural materials were recovered in the 40 cm of
sand overlying strong brown clay. Shovel Test
236 was placed southwest of the stock tank and
exposed 40 cm of clay loam over strong brown
clay.No artifacts were recovered, and water filled
the test unit.
Starkey Creek Road continues southward,
off the terrace, crossing Starkey Creek. Shovel
Tests 204 and 208 were placed immediately
north and south of Starkey Creek, west of
Starkey Creek Road. No artifacts were encountered in these tests. Three tests (206, 232, and
234) were placed on the terrace edge just above
the floodplain, east and west of Starkey Creek
Road. Strong brown sandy clay was encountered
in the three tests at 37, 80, and 20 cm. Two of
these were positive. Shovel Test 232 yielded one
flake from Level 2 (20-40 cm), and Shovel Test
206 yielded two fire-cracked rocks from Level 1
(0-20 cm) and one flake from Level 2 (20-40 cm).
A fourth test (215) was placed east of the road
on a small, round rise near the edge of the terrace. Three flakes were recovered from Level 1
(0-20 cm), and three from Level 2 (20-40 cm).
Sandy clay was encountered at 39 cm. The test
produced no indication that the rise is a constructed prehistoric mound.
Intensive shovel testing was done north of
this rise between Starkey Creek Road and the
terrace margin, east of a trailer house. A cluster
of cattails indicates the location of a septic tank
east of the trailer house. Shovel Tests 212-214,
216, and 217 yielded one flake from Level 1 (020 cm); one silicified wood core, three silicified
wood flakes, and one fire-cracked rock from Level
29

Ten shovel tests were excavated during the
second phase of work (2-127 through 2-136).
These were placed between the northern boundary of Area 3 and an ephemeral ditch that extends from Starkey Creek Road southeast to
Starkey Creek, in the vicinity of two occupied
trailer homes. Strong brown clayey subsoil was
encountered at 0-90 cm overlain by brown, dark
yellowish brown, or grayish brown sandy loam.
Three tests (2-127, 2-128, and 2-130) were placed
between Starkey Creek Road and the southern
trailer home. Shovel Test 2-127 encountered one
fire-cracked rock (not collected) in Level 2 (2040 cm). Four tests (2-129, 2-131, 2-133, and 2134) were placed on a small rise east of the
trailer homes. Shovel Test 2-131 yielded one
flake from Level 2 (20-40 cm). Finally, three tests
(2-134 through 2-136) were placed at the east
end of the landform, just west of the Starkey
Creek floodplain. Shovel Test 2-132 recovered
two flakes from Level 1 (0-20 cm).
In summary, 41HS846 is a large, partially
disturbed prehistoric occupation site on a low
terrace overlooking Starkey Creek to the east
and south. Artifacts observed on the surface are
limited to 13 flakes found in three plowed gardens. Fourteen of the 32 shovel tests produced
cultural materials ranging from 0 to 80 cm in
depth. Artifacts from Level 1 (0-20 cm) consist
of 1 ceramic sherd, 9 pieces of debitage, and 2
fire-cracked rocks. Nine pieces of debitage, 2 firecracked rocks, and 1 core were recovered at 20
to 40 cm. Finally, 1 ceramic sherd was recovered
from Level 4 (60-80 cm). Judging by James
Fyffe's collection, however, it appears that the
artifacts found in the tests and the garden areas may not be fully representative of the materials present. His collection contains many
ceramic sherds and lithic tools, and it is likely
that many more such artifacts remain, particularly in areas that have not been plowed and
scoured for artifacts in recent years. The brushed
sherds and Perdiz points in Fyffe's collection
indicate occupation during the middle to late
Caddoan period, and 41HS846 probably is a village associated with the Caddoan mound complex at 41HS15 ca. 0.9 km to the north.

east-southwest by 50 m north-south. The site lies
on a sparsely wooded slope with open patches.
Ground visibility is generally poor (10-20 percent) because ofleaf-fall, and no artifacts were
observed on the surface. The site appears to be
intact, although the upper levels probably have
been disturbed to some extent by sheetwash,
plowing, and timbering. Twelve shovel tests (268 and 2-70 through 2-80) were excavated over
an area of ca. 125xl 75 m. The tests exposed yellowish brown to grayish brown sandy loam over
strong brown silty clay. On the upper portion of
the slope, shovel tests reached 33-54 cm in depth
before hitting strong brown silty clay. Midslope
tests reached 68-78 cm, and tests on the lower
portions of the slope reached 70-80 cm in depth.
Six shovel tests were positive (2-68, 2-71, 272, 2-74, 2-75, and 2-78). Artifacts were recovered at 0-60 cm below the surface. Level 1
(0-20 cm) produced two chert flakes, two silicified wood flakes, and four ceramic sherds. Three
chert flakes and two sherds were recovered from
Level 2 (20-40 cm). Level 3 (40-60 cm) produced
two silicified wood flakes and one ceramic sherd.
No diagnostic lithic artifacts were recovered, but
the seven ceramic sherds indicate a Caddoan occupation. None of the sherds are decorated, and
thus it is difficult to assess the site temporally.
However, its proximity to 41HS537, 41HS843,
and 41HS844 farther south on the east side of
Starkey Creek suggests that it may be associated with them and hence date to the middle to
late Caddoan period. If so, it may be a campsite
associated with the large Caddoan mound and
village complex at 41HS15 just 0.4 km to the
west.

41HS851
Site 41HS851 is a light prehistoric lithic
scatter situated on the slope of an interfluve east
of Starkey Creek (see Figure 7). The site lies in
an open, grassy pasture with poor visibility (5
percent); no artifacts were observed on the surface. The site has relatively shallow soils and
may have suffered from sheetwash. Other likely
disturbance factors are clearing and plowing.
Ten shovel tests (2-101through2-110) were
excavated, covering an area of 90x120 m. The
only two positive tests (2-101 and 2-104) indicate the site is 90 m north-south by 20 m eastwest (although it may continue south outside
Area 5). Shovel tests exposed brown, grayish

brown, or dark yellowish brown sandy loam over
strong brown clay loam. Tests on the higher portions of the slope reached 30-4 7 cm below the
surface. Midslope tests reached 15-38 cm, and
the lower elevation tests reached only 5-18 cm
before hitting clayey subsoil.
Artifacts were recovered at 0-40 cm below
the surface. One flake was recovered from Level
1 (0-20 cm) in Shovel Test 2-101, and one flake
and a biface fragment were recovered from Level
2 (20-40 cm) in Shovel Test 2-104. No diagnostic artifacts were found, and thus it is difficult
to assess the site temporally. The lack of ceramics suggests that it may not be associated with
the mound complex at 41HS15 to the west, however.

representing past looting activities. The area
south of the fence has multiple recent bulldozer
scrapes to a depth of ca. 0.5 m reflecting recent
looting. Because of extensive disturbance, the
area south of the fence line was not shovel tested
and hence the extent of the site there is uncertain. However, based on the bulldozer activities
and the landform, it probably once extended at
least 30-40 m south of the fence.
Five shovel tests were placed in the lessdisturbed part of the site north of the fence line.
Shovel Tests 3-65 through 3-69 exposed 93115 cm oflight to dark brown sandy loam. No
subsoil was encountered in these tests, but the
lower deposits became slightly clayey in Shovel
Test 3-69. Three of the five shovel tests were positive. Cultural materials were recovered at 40115 cm below the surface, totaling two flakes,
one core, and a dart point. One edge-modified
flake was recovered from Shovel Test 3-65, Level
3 (40-60 cm). Shovel Test 3-68 produced one
flake from Level 3 (40-60 cm) and the core and
dart point were recovered from Shovel Test 369, Level 5 (100-115 cm). The dart point has
been heavily reworked and cannot be identified
typologically. It has a rectangular stem (1.5 cm
long and 1.4 cm wide) with a slightly convex base
and unground edges. The small, triangular, reworked blade is 1. 7 cm long and has a maximum
width of2.3 cm. The point was fashioned of dark
gray chert and has a remnant of brown cortex
on one face. The dart point and lack of ceramics
suggest that this may be the remains of an Archaic campsite. This is supported by an
informant's report that the looting activities in
the southern part of the site produced dart
points.

41HS852
Site 41HS852 is located on a slight rise immediately west of the bank of Potters Creek (Figure 13). The area is in bottomland forest, and
ground surface visibility is poor. Based on surface evidence, the area does not appear to have
suffered from major ground-disturbing activities.
Four shovel tests were placed on this rise. Only
Shovel Test 3-55 was positive and exposed
100 cm of dark grayish brown sand. No subsoil
was encountered. Five lithic flakes were found
in this test at 20-100 cm below the surface: two
from Level 2 (20-40 cm), two from Level 4 (6080 cm), and one from Level 5 (80-100 cm). The
three negative tests on this same landform
within 20-30 m of the single positive test indicate that this site is a small, sparse lithic scatter. The lack of diagnostic artifacts makes it
difficult to assess the site temporally, but the
fact that no ceramics were found suggests that
it may predate the Late Prehistoric period and
hence not be associated with the mound complex at 41HS15 to the east.

ASSESSMENTS AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
The survey work reported here focused on
eight tracts in Sabine Mine's Area Q. During the
course of this project, 100 percent pedestrian
survey of 613 acres traversed 4 previously recorded archeological sites (41HS536, 41HS537,
41HS573, and 41HS574) and 10 new sites
(41HS841-41HS846 and 41HS850-41HS853).
Site 41HS841 is historic, and 41HS842 is mostly
historic with a minor prehistoric component. All
of the other sites are prehistoric, with 41HS573
also having a minor historic component.
Site 41HS841, a still-occupied housesite, is

41HS853
Site 41HS853 is located on a ca. 1-m-high
natural rise on the floodplain just west of Potters
Creek (see Figure 13). The area is wooded and
overgrown, and ground surface visibility generally is poor. The rise is bisected by an east-west
fence line, and the site extends ca. 40 m north of
this fence and 60 m east-west. The surface in
this area has many old (estimated to be 5-20
years), partially filled shovel holes apparently

Of the 12 prehistoric sites, 5 (41HS536,
41HS845, 41HS851, 41HS852, and 41HS853) are
considered ineligible for National Register listing and 7 (41HS537, 41HS573, 41HS574,
41HS843, 41HS844, 41HS846, and 41HS850)
need further work for eligibility assessments.
Site 41HS536 has been destroyed and clearly
lacks the capacity to contribute important information. It is not eligible for listing in the
National Register, and no further work is recommended. Sites 41HS845, 41HS851, and
41HS852 are considered ineligible because they
contain scatters of lithic artifacts that are so
sparse that it is doubtful that interpretable
samples of cultural materials could be obtained.
Further, no ceramic sherds were found in shovel
testing, and thus their ages and potential associations with other important sites nearby (especially the mound complex at 41HS15) remain
unknown. No further work is recommended at
these sites. Site 41HS853 also is considered ineligible and is recommended for no further work.
This site appears to contain an Archaic campsite, but the lithic artifacts are sparsely scattered
in homogeneous sands where isolating components would be problematical. Further, the site
has been badly damaged by looting.
The potential importance of the seven sites
needing further work for assessments stems in
part from their likely association with 41HS15.
Site 41HS15 is a largely intact middle to late
Caddoan mound and village site that occupies a
large area on the ridge west of Starkey Creek
and Survey Areas 5 and 7 and east of Potters
Creek and Survey Areas 1 and 8. Extensive test
excavations at 41HS15 in June-August 2004
revealed that it contains three mounds evident
on the surface, at least one other buried mound,
areas with nonmound structures, and a cemetery
for high-status individuals surrounding a large
plaza, with discrete clusters of cultural features
(including burials) in peripheral areas representing residential loci. The mounds and cemetery
reflect use of the site for ceremonial and mortuary purposes by a large, settled, agricultural
population who lived up and down the valleys
of Starkey and Potters Creeks, and in other
nearby valleys as well. Site 41HS15 and associated sites probably representing multifamily
villages, smaller residential hamlets, and specialpurpose resource procurement or processing
camps are key to understanding Caddoan settlement of this part of the Sabine River basin.

considered ineligible for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places because it dates to
the mid to late twentieth century, contains a mix
of modern and older materials (some introduced
from offsite), and the house exhibits multiple
remodeling episodes. The site is too recent and
retains too little integrity to be significant under any National Register criteria.
The other historic site, 41HS842, contains a
mid-twentieth-century barn and livestock chute
and the buried remains of a house. The site is
on the ca. 1,476-acre John Patterson Survey,
which was occupied as early as ca. 1845 by Jesse
Walling and subsequently (1861 to the mid1870s) by the Wyatt Jarrus Rosborough family
and then the John McClellan family (18841932). The archeological evidence suggests that
the house at 41HS842 was associated chiefly, if
not solely, with occupation by the McClellans.
While the handmade bricks hint at some use
prior to the last quarter of the nineteenth century, the few diagnostic artifacts (especially, the
ceramic sherd with the royal arms mark and the
mix of cut and wire nails) are most consistent
with an occupation during the late nineteenth
and early twentieth centuries, i.e., the years that
the McClellans owned the property. Sites of this
vintage and associated with freedmen can, in
some cases, yield important information. An example is the Rubin Hancock Farmstead in Travis
County, where multiple lines of evidencearcheological, archival, and especially oral history-were integrated to create a better
understanding of rural African American
lifeways in the decades flanking the turn of the
century (Blake and Myers 1999). Lacking oral
history information, however, the housesite at
41HS842 appears to have a more-limited capacity to contribute important information and to
fall in that class of turn-of-the-century sites
where further work beyond the survey level typically is not warranted (Denton 1999). Thus, it is
recommended that the housesite at 41HS842 be
considered ineligible for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places. The mid-twentiethcentury barn and livestock chute also are considered ineligible because of their recent age and
lack of integrity. Site 41HS842 also contains a
very sparse scatter of prehistoric lithic artifacts;
these remains are so few that it is clear that
they lack the capacity to contribute important
information, and hence this component also is
ineligible for listing in the National Register.
33

Of the seven sites needing further work,
41HS846 stands out because ofits large size and
position on a level terrace overlooking Starkey
Creek not far south of 41HS15, as well as the
large collection of ceramic and lithic artifacts
obtained by the landowner that clearly connects
41HS846 temporally to 41HS15. It appears to
be a Caddoan village belonging to the 41HS15
complex, and it probably is eligible for National
Register listing, although test excavations would
be required to determine this with certainty.
Though parts of the site have been disturbed,
other areas have not and retain a high potential
for cultural features such as house patterns and
human burials. Shovel testing indicates that the
surface sediments are thin enough in most places
(mean depth to clay in positive tests = 56 cm)
that these features should be apparent. Artifact
densities in the shovel tests tend to be low, but
collections by the landowner suggest that artifacts-including large ceramic sherds-are
abundant in places. It is recommended that test
excavations be undertaken to assess this site.
This testing should consist of the following: (1)
backhoe trenching to identify parts of the site
where subsurface disturbance is limited and
where the surface sediments are sufficiently thin
that cultural features are likely to be preserved
and to confirm that the four low rises on and
just west of the site are not constructed prehistoric mounds; (2) machine stripping in areas
where features might be preserved to determine
the kinds and distributions of features present
and to determine whether the site contains interpretable feature patterning; and (3) controlled
manual excavations in areas with the potential
for preserved cultural features to document the
kinds and densities of artifacts and ecofacts. In
addition, the landowner's artifact collection should
be documented to aid in interpreting the site.
Sites 41HS573 and 41HS574 also stand out
because they are immediately east of and occupy
the same landform as 41HS15. The materials
recovered in shovel testing and the 1994 surface collection from 41HS574 indicate that both
sites are associated with 41HS15, and given their
proximity they almost certainly are parts of
41HS15. Both probably contain hamlets or small
villages, and both may be eligible for listing in
the National Register. Site 41HS574, in addition,
apparently at one time contained human burials, and it is possible that additional unlooted
burials remain, potentially contributing further

to its eligibility for listing. Shovel testing shows
that the surface sediments are thin enough in
most places (mean depth to clay in positive tests
= 61 cm at 41HS573 and 49 cm at 41HS57 4) that
features such as postholes, pits, and burials
should be definable. Test excavations should be
undertaken to assess these sites. As at 41HS846,
testing should consist of: (1) backhoe trenching
to identify areas where subsurface disturbance
is limited and where the surface sediments are
thin enough for cultural features to be preserved;
(2) machine stripping in areas where features
might be preserved; and (3) controlled manual
excavations in areas with the potential for preserved cultural features.
The other four sites recommended for testing-4lHS537, 41HS843, 41HS844, and
41HS850-are smaller sites on interfluves and
terraces across Starkey Creek from 41HS15
(41HS537 overall is large, but it actually consists of three widely separated, small areas with
cultural materials). Shovel testing did not recover abundant artifacts from any of these sites,
but all four yielded sufficient numbers of cerami~
sherds (some decorated with brushing, which is
common in the ceramics from 41HS15 and
41HS846) to suggest that they are connected to
41HS15. If they are associated, they are likely
to represent small residential hamlets or shortterm campsites, judging from their sizes and
apparently sparser artifacts.
Of these four, 41HS537 and 41HS850 may
have a greater potential to contain discernible
cultural features such as house patterns and pits,
since the surface sands are relatively thin there
(mean depth to clay in positive tests = 40 cm at
41HS537 and 50 cm at 41HS850). The clay subsoil is deeper at the other two sites (100+ cm),
and thus cultural features expressed solely as
soil disturbances may be harder to identify.
Other kinds of more-durable features, including human burials with grave goods, should be
identifiable, though, and the artifact assemblages from all four sites should be informative
about whether and how the sites are associated
with 41HS15. It is recommended that test excavations be undertaken to assess these four sites.
This testing should follow the same strategy
proposed for 41HS846, 41HS573, and 41HS57 4:
(1) backhoe trenching to identify areas where
subsurface disturbance is limited and to determine the thickness of the surface sands; (2)
machine stripping in areas where features might
34

be preserved to determine the kinds and distributions of features present; and (3) controlled

manual excavations to document the kinds and
densities of artifacts and ecofacts.
