EVIDENCE OF EARLY MAN IN TORRANCE
COUNTY, NEW !viEXIC0 1
C. v . HAYNES,

JR.

For the past three years I have devoted vacations and
what spare time I could afford to studying and investigating evidences of Early Man in New Mexico. For a number
of reasons, from the beginning I found Torrance County
to be one of the most interesting in the state. Local collections, almost without exception, contain spear points that
have been attributed to Early Man. Because of drouth in
the 1930's and in recent years, subsoils have been exposed
in many areas, several of which have yielded ancient artifacts and extinct fauna. The county encompasses the southern half of the Estancia basin and the whole of the Encino
and Pinos Wells basins as described by 0. E. Meinzer (1911).
From all indications, it may be deduced that this area
once comprised a lush lake-studded terrain, ideally suited to
the hunting of mammoth and bison during the late Pleistocene and early Recent epochs.
The only standing bodies of water now existing in the
ancient lake beds are salt flats that contain water only
after heavy rains. These depressions do not necessarily correspond to the last remnants of the ancient lakes since they
are formed by wind erosion to the ground-water level and
are characterized by mounds of eolian sand around the leeward sides. The shore lines of the ancient lakes varied as
the water level fluctuated with changing climatic conditions.
Antevs (1935) has reviewed the geology and reconstructed
the past climatic history of the area, estimating an age of
about 15,000 years for the highest stand of Lake Estancia.
This stand was at an elevation of about 6,200 feet.
In addition, Torrance County 'i ncludes part of th e SandiaManzano area, where a sizable contribution to our knowledge of Early Man has been made (Hibben, 1941). Folsom
1. A word of appreciation is in order for the expert advice
and valuable criticism offered me by Alex D. Krieger, H. M.
Wormington, and Fred Wendorf, who reviewed the manuscript.

and "Yuma" finds in this area have previously been mentioned by Hurt (1942) .
DURAN MESA
Duran Mesa lies two and a half miles west of Duran,
New Mexico, on the eastern edge of the Pinos Wells Basin.
It is a prominent landmark which overlooks the adjacent
basins. The basal slopes on the north and east sides of the
mesa consist of aeolian sand piled against the steep sides.
This sand presumably originated from the basins and was
deposited by westerly winds eddying over the mesa. The
sand hills at present support a sparse vegetation of grass,
cedar, juniper, and an occasional ponderosa pine. Because
of the recent dryness, th e grass mantle has dwindled sufficiently to allow the wind to scoop out shallow depressions.
It was in these eroded patches that Mr. and Mrs. Alonzo
Sultemeier of Vaughn, New Mexico began finding artifacts
several years ago.
Site 1 (Fig. 5) is on the property of Mr. Neal B. Smith
of Duran, at the base of a gully running down the side of
the mesa. Mr. Smith states that a spring was active in this
gully some 20 years ago and that an Indian trail to it has
only recently become obliterated.
The artifacts consist of whole or broken points and scrapers, all of which have come from the surface. Bases of
broken points predominate. The abundance of spalls and
flint debris indicates that artifacts were fashioned at this
site.
From the wide variety of points represented, it is evident
that several different peoples visited the locality. Since all
of the material obtained thus far is from the surface, it is
impossible to state whether the artifacts are contemporaneous or not. Even though a Folsom point and a Plainview
point base fragment were found on the same surface as
Eden and Portales artifacts, we can assume that at least
one time gap is indicated: the latter types, wherever superimposed, have always been found to overlie the former,

and in some cases are separated by a stratigraphic hiatus
(Sellards, 1952).
The only other materials that might date within or even
antedate Folsom times are several unclassified points (Plate
18, A-C, G). While such points seem to have a wide distribution in New Mexico and neighboring states, little is known
about them. However, that in Plate 18, C compares in some
features with one from Sandia Cave, New Mexico (Hibben,
1941, Plate 12, No. 1 B).
The Folsom point (Plate 18, M) previously mentioned
lacks both tip and base. Although one channel is askew
and a fine marginal retouch is lacking, the basal edges are
smooth and it is reasonable to assume that the artifact
was once complete. The Plainview point (Plate 19, F) is
similar to those found at the type site (Krieger, 1947, Plates
3, 4), even to thinning the base by removal of three narrow,
parallel spalls. This base is made of Alibates flint, as are
four of those from the original Plainview site (Krieger,
1947, p. 939)
0

For the most part, the other points from Duran Mesa
represent types generally believed to be later than Folsom
or to be associated with essentially modern forms of bison.
Eden material (Moss, 1951) is represented by a typical stem
(Plate 19, A) and a complete example (Plate 18, D). Plate
18, 0 may be best classified as an Eden stem showing fine
parallel flaking. A small Scottsbluff point (Plate 18, K) that
closely resembles one from the Portales horizon at Blackwater Draw (Sellards, 1952, Fig. 37, H) was found by the
Sultemeiers. Several bases (Plate 18, H, N) can be compared with points of the Hot Springs focus near Angostura,
South Dakota (Hughes, 1949, Fig. 68). Plate 18, H has
slightly concave edges; however, this might well have resulted from grinding rather than intention.
Two points (Plate 18, E, F) and four bases (Plate 19, B-E)
are of interest as they compare favorably with points from
the Agate Basin in Wyoming (Roberts, 1951, p. 19). That
in Plate 19, E reveals oblique parallel flaking. The point in

148

Texas Archeological Society

Plate 18, L might also be classed with those from Agate
Basin, were it not so short; it is also very similar to a
specimen from the Portales horizon at Blackwater Draw,
New Mexico (Sellards, 1952, Fig. 36, E). In outline the
specimen in Plate 18, J is similar to the "Long" point shown
by Hughes (1949, Fig. 68, P) from South Dakota. Hughes'
"Long type" is now generally known as Angostura (Suhm,
Krieger, and Jelks, 1954, p. 402 and Plate 80).
It seems possible that the makers of some points designed
them with long bodies so that if the tips snapped off they
could be re-pointed and still leave enough material to work
with. Several specimens (Plate 18, D, I, J, K, L) from this
area could be the objects of such economy. At first glance
Plate 18, I might be called a well-made San Jon point (Roberts, 1942) , but upon closer examination it appears to have
been either a re-shaped Scottsbluff point with the shoulders
removed in the process, or a small example of the Milnesand
type recently recognized by Sellards (1955, Figs. 98-100) .

Other artifacts from Duran Mesa comprise "snub-nosed"
scrapers, side scrapers, and portions of flint knives. In the
order of prevalence, the materials used in the manufacture
of artifacts include Alibates flint, quartzite, chalcedony,
blue-gray flint, red pitchstone, and a hard siliceous mudstone. The preponderance of Alibates flint in spalls as well
as complete artifacts is of interest because the quarries for
this material are over 300 miles away, north of Amarillo,
Texas.
LAS TRINCHERAS
A group of mesas four miles north of Duran on the Hindi
ranch is known as the Trincheras (Fig. 5, site 2) . Here, in
a situation similar to that at Duran Mesa, Nabay Hindi
found several interesting point fragments, three of which
(Plate 19, G-I) are basal portions, and one other is a midsection. They all display ground edges, marginal retouch,
and a wavy base formed by the nubbin or fluting seat in
the basal concavity so prevalent in classic Folsom points
such as those found at Lindenmeier, Colorado (Roberts,

1935) . These points, however, are too thin to have been
fluted. One reason for their thinness is that they are flaked
horizontally parallel in such a manner that some of the
spalls went from one edge to the other without a break, and
without curving to any extent. As a result, the cross-section
is relatively flat rather than markedly bi-convex. This characteristic is noticeable on the tip of some classic Folsom
points where the channel flake did not remove all the
horizontal flaking. It is possible that some makers of Folsomlike points preferred to thin them by removing wide, flat
horizontal flakes rather than by fluting. A number of "unfluted Folsom points" similarly thin have been described
at the Scharbauer ranch site near Midland, Texas (Wendorf,
Krieger, Albritton, and Stewart, 1955, pp. 48-49, 57, and Fig.
16, No. 27).
PINOS MOUNTAINS
The collections of Alonzo Sultemeier of Vaughn, Lonnie
Welch of Pinos Wells, and K. W. Kendall of Willard, all
contain ancient spear points found in or about the Pinos
Mountains (Fig. 5). These mountains, forming the only
prominent elevation between the southern extremity of
the Estancia basin and the Pinos Wells basin, lie 14 miles
west of Duran Mesa. Attempts to farm the area adjacent
to the mountains over the past 30 years have resulted in
many denuded fields. These fields and small windswept
patches on the slopes have yielded several spear points
that can be attributed to Early Man.
Two basal fragments of spear points in the Sultemeier
collection came from a sandy area on the southeastern
slopes (Fig. 5, site 5). One (Plate 19, J) represents a finely
made Eden point with a marked diamond cross-section and
has ground edges but no shoulders. The material appears
to be black chert now covered with a fine arenaceous encrustation. The other one (Plate 19, K) is unusual in that
the edges and base of the stem are deeply concave. This
point also was made from a black siliceous material which
is now encrusted.

152

Texas Archeological Society

Lonnie Welch and members of his family have been
collecting artifacts from the Pinos Mountains for many
years. Among these are several worthy of mention in relation to Early Man. A classic Folsom point (Plate 19, M)
was found in a wind-blown field Â· (Fig. 5, site 3) three miles
north of the mountains. A mile or so south is another field
(Fig. 5, site 4) on the north slope of the mountains. It is
here that Mrs. Welch found a large fluted point (Plate 19, 0)
of Alibates flint. It is almost a duplicate of one associated
with the Naco mammoth in Arizona (Haury, 1953, Fig.
6-7, H) and can, without question, be classified as a Clovis
fluted point. A single channel flake 2 em. long has been
removed from one side, whereas the other side has been
thinned by the removal of four converging spalls. As on
Clovis fluted points, the edges show smoothing for over
a third of the total length of the specimen.
The exact occurences of the other points (Plate 19,
L, N, P, Q) in the Welch collection are not definite. They
are for the most part unclassified although Plate 19, N
has a remote resemblance to Sandia points. Plate 19, P
and Q are interesting in that they have been observed in
several collections throughout New Mexico and are similar
to some illustrated from Concho, Arizona (Wendorf and
Thomas, 1951, Fig. 48, B, C, E, F).
KENDALL COLLECTION
Mr. K. W. Kendall of Willard, New Mexico, homesteaded
some 30 years ago on property a mile or so west of the
Pinos Mountains. During the drouth of the early 1930's
one of his fields (Fig. 5, site 6) became scoured to a depth
of several feet. While this scouring was taking place, Mr.
Kendall picked up many artifacts as they were exposed
by the wind and noted several hearths and firepits. He has
closely examined this blowout and others in the surrounding country ever since, and has acquired a fine collection
of ancient points.
Â·
In this collection two points (not illustrated) are similar
to that of Plate 18, J, and to the specimen from Blackwater

Draw included in the Portales complex (Sellards, 1952,
Fig. 36, E). Another is Folsom in outline but is unfluted
and crudely made from black andesite. The basal portion
of a large well-made fluted point (Plate 19, R) of orangewhite Alibates flint can be classed only with Clovis fluted .
A crude but interesting point was found protruding from
the walls of an arroyo in the Pinos Mountains. Again it is
a type about which little is known, although it is assumed
to be ancient (Hibben, personal communication) . A point
from near Concho, Arizona (Wendorf and Thomas, 1951,
Fig. 47, A) closely resembles Mr. Kendall's except for the
concave base.
Because the drought of the past few years has caused
renewed wind erosion, Mr. Kendall was able to make some
very interesting finds in 1954. The most significant of these
finds was reported to Dr. Hibben of the University of New
Mexico, who devoted part of the 1954 field session to excavating mammoth and artifact material from denuded
deposits (Fig. 5, site 8) west of Rattlesnake Hill, seven miles
south of Lucy, New Mexico. An unusual assemblage of
points, including variants of the Sandia types, was found
on and below the surface along with skeletal material
(Hibben, personal communication).
Another site worthy of special mention is a wind eroded
draw (Fig. 5, site 11) approximately 10 miles north and
a little east of Lucy on the outer margin of what Meinzer
considered the littoral zone of beach materials and alluvium
surrounding ancient Lake Estancia. This draw rarely contains water, and what is carried is probably absorbed long
before reaching the flats. As a result, the draw is filled
with deposits of sand and clay which have been gouged by
the wind revealing an unusual number of artifacts in a
small area of approximately 2000 square feet. Each of the
seven or more points (Plate 20, A is an example) represented are readily comparable to those found at the Agate
Basin site in Wyoming (Roberts, 1951, p. 19) except that
the complete ones are rather short, possibly from having
been re-sharpened. If Plate 20, A were to be re-pointed to

156

a relatively blunt, somewhat triangular, tip it would approximate some of the other specimens found but not illustrated here. Besides the points, nearly a dozen scrapers and
a knife were obtained by Mr. Kendall and members of his
family . Additional investigation may warrant a separate
report on this site.
Other finds by Mr. Kendall include a large bison skull
weathering in a dune area (Fig. 5, site 10) eight miles
north and a little east of Lucy. It is less than two miles
from the previously mentioned site 11 and, given a litt le
more time and dry weather, this area should reveal additional material of interest. A single find in a blown-out field
(Fig. 5, site 9) only two miles north of Lucy is a skillfully
worked point nearly identical with one found at Blackwater Draw in the Portales horizon (Sellards, 1952, Fig.
36-36 b) . This would now be classified with the Milnesand
type (Sellards, 1955).
Artifacts of more recent origin, but of no less import, have
appeared in a wind-eroded ravine (Fig. 5, site 7) two and
one half miles northeast of the abandoned town of Progresso on the Velasquez ranch. It has revealed pre-pottery
material that may be related to the Atrisco sites (Campbell
and Ellis, 1952) . Many rock-lined hearths, one-hand manos,
and sandstone slab metates were observed. Many of the
points resemble some of those illustrated by Campbell and
Ellis (1952, Figs. 71-72, middle rows). It should be noted
that this same type of material has appeared at Duran Mesa,
the Pinos Mountains, and in other neighboring areas.
BIGBEE SITE
According to Mrs. J. Frank Bigbee, a half section of
land (Fig. 5, site 12) on the Bigbee ranch , 10 miles north
of Encino, was plowed some 20 years ago. Since that time
it has been almost completely denuded by wind which has
piled dunes across State Highway 3 to such an extent that
the road has had to be re-routed several times around the
drifting sands. Even though it may be small compensation
for the futile efforts of the farmer, his field has produced

an interesting assemblage of material used by the ancient
hunters. My attention was focused on this area after reconoitering revealed the basal portion of what might be
termed an unfluted Folsom point (Plate 20, H). On a later
visit an additional segment t hat matched this base was
found along with another similar base (Plate 20, I). These
segments, which closely resemble those previously mentioned from the Trincheras, are characterized by parallel
flaking that crosses the entire face horizontally from one
edge to the other, by marginal retouch, and by the remains
of a nubbin in the basal concavity. Indisputable Folsom
evidence was found in the form of a basal portion of a
point (Plate 20, J) of tan quartzite. It is quite similar to the
only quartzite point from the original Folsom type site, even
to the point of being fluted on only one side (Howard, 1943,
Pl. VIII, C) .
Additional artifacts consist of a greenstone base (Plate
20, L) reminiscent of those from the Agate Basin (Roberts,
1951), the basal portion of a finely made Milnesand (?)
point (Plate 20, F) , and the base (Plate 20, E) of a large
fluted obsidian point, probably Clovis fluted (Cotter, 1937,
Pl. 3). A complete point (Plate 20, C) resembles the Long
or Angostura type (Hughes, 1949, Fig. 68 P) although it
appears to have been re-pointed. Each edge of the tip has
been knapped from alternate sides producing a pronounced
beveled or twisted effect. A point (Plate 20, D) similar
to two from the Pinos Mountains (Plate 19, P, Q) and
those from an undescribed site in Bernalillo County, was
found by Lieutenant Gerald C. Shelton of Sandia Base,
New Mexico. He also found the basal portion of a fluted
point (Plate 20, K) which closely resembles those from
the Miami site in Texas which are considered to be Clovis
fluted points (Sellards, 1952, Figs. 8, 9). A nondescript base
(Plate 20, G) is difficult to associate with any clea.rly defined type. Several scrapers and a small fragment of a
fluted point were also found.
What turned out to be the most significant find at the
Bigbee site was that portions of mammoth bones wer e

exposed in a mottled red and gray sandy-clay soil on the
south edge of the blown field. During the summer of 1953,
I excavated a humerus and dug several test holes. These
previous visits failed to disclose any artifact material in
association with mammoth. In the late spring of 1954, Lieutenant Shelton, who is a careful observer, inspected the
site and again no artifacts appeared in association with the
mammoth material. A month later we found more bone
fragments had been exposed by the recent wind and I discovered a large point (Plate 20, B) several feet down slope
from a small ledge where the skeletal material was originating. About the point were several scattered bone fragments. It is reasonable to assume that the point had been
exposed only recently, in fact, within the few days prior
to our visit. In addition, a large flint chip occurred with
the bone fragments weathering from the surface.
In size, outline, and workmanship the point in Plate 20, B
compares with Clovis fluted points and, like the majority
of these, the basal edges and concave base are ground quite
smooth; however, there is no fluting and the basal edges
are notably concave. It is likely that the latter fact is
partly due to the high degree of edge grinding. This specimen may be compared with the Plainview type, as it is
closely similar in all dimensions to number 725-5 from the
Plainview site (Krieger, 1947, Plate 5, No. 1) . Dr. Krieger
examined the specimen and suggested a Plainview classification; however, he pointed out that Clovis and Plainview
points are very similar in shape and dimensions, and that
unfluted points may occasionally accompany fluted Clovis
points, in which case it would be difficult if not impossible
to distinguish them from Plainview points. The association
of Plainview points with mammoth in the Great Plains is
still an open question (Krieger and Wendorf, personal
communications). Although mammoth remains were found
in parts of the Plainview site, their association with the
deposit containing bison fossils and artifacts was not definitely established (Sellards, Evans, Meade, and Krieger,
1947) .

More recent materials have also been found at the Bigbee
site. On the north rim several large camp sites are exposed,
revealing a large quantity of broken Pedernal quartzite
fragments. The remarkably uniform arrow points and potsherds from these camps are of rather recent origin.

Two areas south of the Bigbee ranch deserve mention.
One is the Berlier ranch (Fig. 5, site 13) about 10 miles
northeast of Encino. Several of the points in the collection
of Mrs. Theo Berlier are, no doubt, quite old; however,
they must await classification and m ore information on
the sites. Plate 20, N resembles a Sandia point in shape and
flaking but does not have the pronounced shoulder.
The other site is a deeply blown-out area three and onehalf miles east of Encino. In an ancient sand-hill area
(Fig. 5, site 14) overlooking a windswept basin, Alonzo
Sultemeier of Vaughn found a stubby point (Plate 20, M).
It is problematical whether it should be classified as Scottsbluff or Milnesand, for the very slight shoulders may have
been formed only by grinding of the edges. If the shoulders
were not actually formed intentionally by chipping, it should
be classified as Milnesand. The shoulders in this case are
even less prominent than those of the specimen in Plate
18, K. This find occurred in a deep blowout in the sand
hills only a few inches from a rock-lined fire pit. Several
other fire pits can be observed in the blowout, and some
containing quantities of charcoal are still in place. However,
no inference concerning the association of the above point
and the fire pits can be made at this time. Much flint debris
lies scattered about the floor of this and neighboring blowouts, and other artifacts found represent more recent forms.
SUMMARY
During the late Pleistocene and early Recent epochs the
lush land surrounding the ancient lakes and ponds in what
is now Torrance County, New Mexico, was inhabited by
large mammals of species now extinct. It is no wonder

that man found this an ideal area in which t o camp and
hunt mammoth and bison. Evidence of these early hunters
is being found today as wind and modern drought lay bare
the ancient soil levels. The past presence of man is revealed
by his stone weapons and the skeletons of his prey scattered
about the exposed surfaces that extend inland from the
littoral zones of the ancient lakes. There is little doubt that
continued investigations in this area will make significant
contributions toward the solution of problems of Early Man
and his Pleistocene environment.
