ABSTRACT
The Greenhaw site is a prehistoric locality that has a group of nine burned rock
middens. Assemblages belonging to different Archaic phases were found to cluster
at specific middens indicating horizontal differentiation in the occupations. Data
reinforce the chronology of phases in the Central Texas Archa (Weir, 1976) and
contribute to burned rock midden interpretation.

INTRODUCTION
The Greenhaw site (41HY29) is an open camp site attributable to the
Archaic stage of Central Texas prehistory. The site, consisting of nine burned
rock middens, is situated at the confluence of two small streams that are
tributary to Onion Creek in Hays County, Texas. This paper presents a
description of the artifacts and cultural sequence at the site as determined by
excavation at six of the burned rock middens.
The site was chosen for investigation because material obtained from it by
private collectors indicated that the middens were of different ages and excavation would contribute to the knowledge of Central Texas prehistory. It
was felt that a study of the midden stratigraphy and horizontal distribution of
projectile points and other artifacts would result in the definition of cultural
and chronological units within the site.
The site was first reported in 1963 but had been known locally for many
years. Archeological investigations were begun in March 1964. Working late
evenings and on weekends with volunteer labor, field work was finally completed on August 27, 1966.

ARCHEOLOGICALBACKGROUND
Pioneering efforts in Central Texas archeology were published by Pearce
(1932), Sayles (1935), Ray (1938, 1948), and Kelley (1947a, 1947b,
1959). With the Suhm et al. (1954) publication, various interpretations of
Texas archeology were brought together in one volume. Suhm (1960) presented a more comprehensive study of historical developments of Central
Texas archeology. Johnson et al. (1962) distinguished Early, Middle, Late,
and Transitional periods within the Archaic. These periods were based primarily on variations of projectile point types. This periodization has since
found wide acceptance and common usage.
At Youngsport, Shafer (1963) recovered a point type named Gower.
This type was found stratigraphically below artifacts which Johnson et al.
(1962) termed Early Archaic. Johnson (1964) reported a similar situation at

6

Texas Archeological Society

the Devil’s Mouth site. However, Johnson (1964) called his early stemmed
points "early barbed." Archaic material was being collected that was much
older than the Early Archaic of Johnson et al. (1962). Sollberger and Hester
(1970:339) recognized these materials as belonging to still another Archaic
period, labeling it the Pre-Archaic.
Kelley (1947) was the first to apply the Midwestern Taxonomic System to
Central Texas assemblages. Although his foci have fallen into disuse, the term
Edwards Plateau Aspect has continued in use. Recently, Weir (1976a,
1976b) suggested that the term aspect was not appropriate as applied to the
Central Texas Archaic. He proposed eliminating Edwards Plateau Aspect
and reference to Early, Middle, and Late Archaic. A construct of phases was
suggested to supplant the older system.
Weir (1976) defined five phases for the Central Texas Archaic. They are:
The San Geronimo Phase (8,000 to 4,500 B.P.)~ The Clear Fork Phase
(5,000 to 4,000 B.P.); The Round Rock Phase (4,200 to 2,600 B.P.); The
San Marcos Phase (2,800to 1,800 B.P.)~ and The Twin Sisters Phase (2,000
to 700 B.P.). This system is less restrictive since changes can be made (i.e.,
substitution, addition, or elimination). The proposed designation of the sys~
tem approximately equates with previous designations: San Geronimo -Pre-Archaic~ Clear Fork - Early Archaic; Round Rock = Middle Archaic;
San Marcos -- Late Archaic; and Twin Sisters = Transitional Archaic. The
new designations are followed.

THE SITE
The Greenhaw site (41HY29) is located on the eastern edge of the
Edwards Plateau (Fig. 1). It is situated on the northern slope of a hill overlooking the confluence of Cottonwood and Little Bear creeks, west of the town of
Buda, Hays County, Texas. The two intermittent streams join at the southern
edge of a valley that was produced by the downcutting of Little Bear Creek
and its tributaries.
Little Bear creek runs along the base of the hill on which the midden area
of the site is located (Fig. 2). At this point, the creek formed a low bluff. At one
time, the stream ran several hundred feet north from the hill as indicated by an
old channel scar in the flood plain below the site. Artifacts are found on either
side of the old channel and up to the bluff, indicating that some occupation,
however minor, had occurred.
The slope on which the midden area of the site is located is composed of
alternating soft and hard strata of the Fredericksburg group, Comanchean
series, Cretaceous age limestones. Erosion produced stair-stepping on the
slope as a result of inclined weathering of the softer marl and joint weathering
of the hard strata. The softer strata appear as slopes of about 15° while the
harder outcrops appear as flat ledges averaging 20 ft across~
The bluff is composed of a rather thick outcrop of hard limestone projecting slightly from beneath a softer stratum which in turn is capped by a thinner
hard stratum forming the bluff top. This capping stratum constitutes the unit
designated Ledge #I. Cultural debris, including most of the middens, is most
heavily concentrated above this ledge. Chipping debris is most noticeable on
the ledges, which were numbered in progression from bottom to top (Fig. 2).

The middens range in diameter from 16 to 105 ft, with maximum depths
from 6 to 50 in. Only the middens, among the cultural evidence, have any
significant depth.

THE FIELD WORK
The site was first divided arbitrarily into eight areas in order to maintain
control in the collection of artifacts from the surface other than on the burned
rock middens. These surface areas are indicated by Roman numerals. From
east to west, the middens were designated A through I (Fig. 2). A nail driven
in a tree on the edge of Midden C was given the arbitrary designation of
N100W100 in a grid oriented on magnetic north. All coordinates over the
site, except at Midden E, are relative to that designatiom A separate grid
orientation was employed on Midden E because of a unique feature found in
this midden.

For the most part, excavated squares were removed in arbitrary 6 in
levels. However, in Midden C, several other methods were also used experimentally.
During 1964, relic collectors were constantly at work in Midden C. The
degree of their concern with what was being attempted varied from person to
person, thus limiting the degree of cooperation received from them. For the
most part, materials recovered by collectors were only useful in the total count
of artifacts and in horizontal distribution within the midden.
In the course of excavation, stone size was determined to be important in
determining stratigraphy since some zones contained larger burned rock than
others. Rocks are discussed as boulder (greater than 25 cm), large (10 to 25
cm), medium (6 to 10 cm), and small (less than 6 cm).

Midden B
This midden is one of the smallest at the Greenhaw site, measuring 25 x
35 ft with its long axis north to south, and seldom reaching 18 in in depth.
Excavations consisted of three squares, 5 x 5 ft each, dug in the central part
where cultural accumulation was thickest. With the exception of one small pot
hole, vandalism had not occurred at this midden. An estimated 10% of the
midden was removed.
There are three definite zones in Midden B, designated A, B, and C from
bedrock to surface (Fig. 3).
Zone A: This basal zone is found in all areas and is frequently interrupted by Zone B.
Sediment color is a light greybrown and texture is somewhat ashy. Large rocks are

common but show little indication of being burned; few are cracked. Everything in this
zone is covered with a calcium carbonate crust. The bedrock is also covered by this crust;
some of the rocks and artifacts were cemented together and to bedrock.
Zone B: This is the thickest zone, in some areas extending from surface to bedrock. The sediment is brown to almost black. This zone is characterized by large to boulder sized rocks
that are larger than in any other midden at the site. Most show signs of being burned, but
only a few were heated to the extent that they cracked and disarticulated. These rocks
were found in all squares excavated and are presumed to occur throughout the midden.
Since they cover the thinner cultural Zone A, it is assumed that they were brought to the
midden from the ledge above rather than being flagstones from the underlying soft
limestone. Snail shells are abundant, especially from Helicina and Polygyra. Rabdotus
occurs only in small numbers. This situation is in contrast to the frequency of these
genera in Midden C.
Zone C: This is the topmost zone. Occasionally, rocks from Zone B protrude through Zone C to
the Surface. Sediment is compact, dark brown to black, and contains a large amount of
fire cracked midden rocks such as are found in Midden C. Rocks are small to medium;
percentage of rock to dirt is about 60% to 40°%.

Midden B-Burial 1 (Fig. 4)
A burial (designated Burial 1) was found in the northern half of square
N105/W55. Most of the skeletal material had decomposed, leaving teeth
and fragments of the calvaria, mandible, and long bone shafts. Age and sex
determinations were made by Michael B. Collins (University of Kentucky).
The sex judgment was based on comparison of the femoral shafts with
those of the more complete male individual in Burial 2 from Midden C. The
degree of femoral robustness was similar in the two individuals; accordingly, it
is likely that Midden B Burial I is a male. The teeth were better preserved than
the bones and demonstrated considerable wear during life. The person appears to have been above the age of 30 at the time of death.
Positioning of the bone fragments indicated that the burial was in a loosely
flexed position, on its right side with the head to the east. The lower extremities were resting on midden debris of Zone A and the head was propped
against a small hummock of bedrock with at least one arm flexed under the
chin. Four large boulders, two of which were slightly exposed at the surface,
were aligned over the burial, east to west, the largest being placed over the
head.
A small, clear quartz crystal and a small, round hematite pebble were at
the base and slightly to the west of the skull. Numerous flint flakes occurred
around the burial, but recognizable artifacts were not found. One small lanceolate point found beneath the burial (in Zone A, cemented to bedrock) is
considered not to be associated with the burial. Because of their provenience,
it is possible that the small crystal and hematite pebble were probably in a
perishable container around the neck of the individual. This material constitutes the only possible burial association.
Some of the covering boulders were exposed at the surface and part of the
skeleton rested on bedrock. With this situation, it is impossible to determine
with certainty when this individual was buried. Burial was later that the midden, but possibly as early as the Clear Fork Phase.
MIDDEN B-FEATURE I. LARGE ROCK CONCENTRATION: This
feature is a large, inverted, bowl shaped heap of stones, most of them larger
than 15 cm in diameter. They are associated with Zone B and comprise a
small mounding of the large rocks within that zone. The feature measures 2 x

3 ft and almost reaches the surface. The sediment is black and the feature may
constitute a hearth or a dumping of hearth stones. However, neither possibility is verifiable. Cultural debris is slightly more abundant within the feature
than in adjoining areas.
MIDDEN B-FEATURE 2. LARGE ROCK CONCENTRATION: This
feature (Fig. 3), almost a duplicate of Midden B-Feature 1, is in Zone B. A
concentration of eight quartz crystals and two small unclassified stemmed dart
points were found within the feature.

(70 × 85 ft), yielding the largest artifact sample. It is separated from Midden B
to the east by a small gully. Midden thickness is greatest (21/2 ft) next to this
drainage. From this side, the midden becomes thinner, fanning out to the
west and south.
From November, 1963, until Mr. Greenhaw’s death in January, 1965,
this midden was in the greatest danger of being destroyed by relic collectors. It
was also during this time that the bulk of controlled work was done at the
midden. Twenty two squares were dug by collectors while the author was
present at the site, affording an opportunity to record what they found. Unfortunately, an area of approximately 40 squares was totally vandalized, resulting in a complete loss of information from these units. Controlled excavation
consisted of 211/2 5 ft squares, two test units, and one trench.
While working on Midden C, it was concluded that due to inadequate
observation and methods of excavation, a clear picture of burned rock middens was not presented in earlier reports on this type of site. For this reason,
several techniques were employed at Midden C in order to determine the best
procedure by which the character of a burned rock midden could be specified.
The first approach applied was the vertical face method, used during
WPA by Jackson and Woolsey (1938) and again by Kelly (!960) at the
Crumley site. In this method, excavation is carried on from surface to bedrock
by means of a vertical face which is moved forward as excavation proceeds.
Frequency of the larger and most noticeable artifacts found in situ is quite
high. Kelly (1960:242) indicated an artifact loss of less than 5% by this
method, but the author would place this loss closer to 20-30% if chipping
debris is included.
The one advantage to the method is that artifacts found in situ can be
placed more precisely in their stratigraphic relationship. Vertical measurements were made from the highest point in the unit excavated. There were
two random test units, eight 5 × 5 ft squares, and one 5 × 19 ft trench
(Trench I) excavated by this method. It proved to be the most rapid of all
methods.
The second approach, excavation by 5 × 5 ft squares in arbitrary 6 in
levels, is one most employed prior to 1965 (Suhm, 1959:220; Johnson et
al., 1962:17). At Midden C, measurements were made from the highest
corner in the square. Due to rock abundance in the matrix, one aspect of the
first approach was utilized. For each level, a 6 in deep trench was excavated
at one side of the unit. The face created was moved across the square until
the entire level was removed. The tool used was a small military pick mattock. The loose earth was passed through a I/4 in mesh hardware cloth.
Artifact loss by this procedure is near zero. Nine and one half squares were
excavated by this method, three of which were not screened.
A third approach, using only a whisk broom and an ice pick, was employed on four squares on the southwestern periphery of the midden.
Depth in these units from surface to bedrock averaged 8 in. This approach
proved to be the most time consuming, but the most accurate.
The internal structure of the midden is as follows (Fig. 5):
Zone A: This is the basal sediment, reddish tan in color with a mixture of much unburned
limestone and rotten limestone derived from bedrock and a minor amount of burned
and cracked limestone. This zone is represented only in the southern half of the
midden. Cultural debris is scattered lightly throughout the zone.

Weir- Greenhaw

Zone B: Grey brown in color, this slightly ashy, burned rock accumulation is found only in the
southeast quarter of the midden. It contains both medium and large rocks, neither size
dominating. Rabdotus are very common. Cultural debris is not abundant.
Zone C: Sediment is grey brown except near the surface where it is nearly black due to recent
decaying organic matter. Organic processes on the midden formed a natural humus
zone that spans the entire surface. Zone C contains small to large burned rock.
Characteristics that’separate this zone from others are rock size, large amount of
gravel, flint chipping debris, and whole and crushed snail shells. This zone is restricted
to the southwestern portion of the midden. Although small in comparison to other
zones, its artifact yield was very high.
ZoneD: This is the most widespread zone in the midden, being thickest in the central portions,
extending toward the north and west. Sediment is a dark ashy brown and almost black
in the upper portions where it is penetrated by the humus stain. All sizes of midden
rock occur throughout the zone. One size may predominate over another in some
portions of the zone and sporadically small areas occur where almost no rocks are
present. From one square to the next, artifact yield varied greatly, from high to almost
nil. This zone is very similar in appearance to Zone B, differing in distribution and in
lack of consistency in rock size.
Zone E: This zone represents one of the last occupational periods of the midden. Sediment is
black with a high content of burned rock. Some gravel occurs throughout, but snails
and chipping debris are scarce and artifact yield is less than in the deeper zones. The
zone usually occurs as a veneer over Zone D in the central part of the midden, but
probably occurs locally in other parts of the midden. Its contact with underlying zones
is characterized by undulations (probably cultural disturbances).
Zone E’: This zone is similar to Zone E only in that it also is a late zone. Zone E seems to blend
into Zone E’ in the eastcentral part of the midden. Zone E’ has more gravel, snails, and
flint flakes than Zone E. The zone resembles Zone C, except that it does not contain
large rocks. Zone E’ overlies Zones B, C, and D and is restricted to the southeastern
portion of the midden.
Zone F: This is the final zone, a black humus sediment of most recent origin. It contains few
rocks and no artifacts, except those intruded by disturbances.

MIDDEN C-BURIAL 2 (Figs. 5, 6). The one burial in Midden C, Burial
2, was a secondary burial below point N86/W109 in the southeast portion
of the midden, where the midden is thickest. The burial pit originated from
Zone E’ and penetrated through Zones B and A to bedrock. During the
accumulation of Zone E’, a pit was dug, near the edge where Zone B angles
from thicker to thinner deposits. The bones were then deposited with a
veneer of midden sediment, rocks, and large amounts of Rabdotus snails.
Large flat rocks, averaging about 20 cm in diameter, were placed on top of
the deposit.
Apparently a fire was built on these rocks after they were placed over the
burial. All were burned, cracked, and articulated but broke apart when removed. A thin layer of fine black sterile sediment 2 to 3 in thick covered the
rocks. The final step was the capping of this sediment with four boulders. The
smallest measured 15 x 23 x 28 cm and the largest 23 x 31 × 36 cm.
Artifacts recovered from the burial fill (see artifact descriptions) include
five dart points: two Pedernales (Variety 11), two Bulverdes (Variety 1) and
(Variety 11), and one Zorra. One Core Form 1, one Scraper Form 5, one
Scraper Form 8, two Biface Form 3, one Biface Form 4, eight biface fragments, and numerous flint flakes also were found. It is assumed that the
artifacts were not burial offerings but rather a mixture of artifacts from those
zones through which the burial pit passed.
Any offerings that might have been placed with the burial cannot be distinguished from material in the original midden detritus. However, the Pedernales (Variety 11) points, which were found at the bottom of the burial pit,

are a form recovered only in Zone E’ and E-D elsewhere in Midden C. Therefore, the burial is no older than the Pedernales points and may date to the
Round Rock Phase.
Some of the bones show rodent gnawing. It is likely that the bones were
exposed to the elements or where rodents could reach them prior to burial in
Midden C, further indication of secondary interment.
The skeletal analysis was made by Michael B. Collins and Thomas S.
Ellzey. Skeletal remains recovered include:
1) Cranial: posterior section of left parietal; small posterior section of
right parietal; small fragment of left occipital; frontal section of left
supraorbital torsus; two molars and one incisor.
2) Appendicular: right radial shaft; left radial shaft fragments; shaft and
proximal end of left humerus; shaft and proximal end of right hu-

Examination of the skeletal material indicated the individual was a young
male, about 5 ft 8 in, between 19 and 23 years of age at the time of death. This
individual was not particularly robust as indicated by some attributes of the
bones. Attributes of the upper limbs fall within the female variation of known
prehistoric populations.
MIDDEN C-FEATURE 1. ARTIFACT CACHE: This feature was found
by relic collectors in the northwest quarter of the midden. Notes taken at the
time document the feature as a small cache of artifacts clustering below point
N98.5W128 around a large rock at 21 in below the surface and 4 in above
bedrock. The sediment was tam it is presumed that the feature was in Zone A.
Artifacts included a complete Palmillas point, the proximal half of a Bulverde
(Variety 111), one Gouge Form 5, one large percussion cortex flake, and two
large thinning flakes. The association may be fortuitous and the term cache
probably inappropriate.
MIDDEN C-FEATURE 2. LARGE ROCK AND CULTURAL REFUSE
CONCENTRATION: This feature consisted of four large flat rocks, three of
which were stacked, ranging from 13 to 19 in in maximum diameter. The
smallest was 10 in northwest from the others. A small silicious limestone
grinding stone was between the smallest one and the larger three. It measured
15 × 12.5 × 3.3 cm and is smooth on only one face. One Langtry dart point,
the stem of an unidentified dart point, one Core Form I, one secondary
cortex flake, three billet flakes, and a small rectangular piece of sandstone
(ground smooth on one face) were found around the grinding stone and on
the south side of the three larger rocks. This feature rested on the contact of
Zones A and D, and is presumed to be associated with Zone D.
MIDDEN C-FEATURE 3. ARTIFACT CONCENTRATION (Fig.
5): This feature was a heavy concentration of lithic artifacts occurring at the
base of the contact between Zones C and D. Prior to deposition of Zone D, the
downhill side of Zone C (the only part covered by Zone D) was unusually
steep (see profile, Fig. 5). It was at the base of this small but steep slope that
these artifacts accumulated and were later covered by Zone D. Whether or
not this concentration occurred as a result of erosion or due to intentional
placement was undetermined.
This feature occurs in Trench 1 and was tabulated as being in Zone C.
Artifacts recovered include one Shumla point, one Bulverde (Variety 1), one
Large Stemmed Point, two Mano Form 2, one Core Form 3, one Core flagment, one hammerstone, two biface fragments, six large secondary cortex
flakes, and eight small thinning flakes.
MIDDEN C-FEATURE 4. SNAIL SHELL CONCENTRATION: This
feature was an extremely dense concentration of Rabdotus snail shells covering an area 3 ft in diameter and about 3 in thick at the contact between

Weir - Greenhaw

17

Zones A and D. This concentration is almost identical to the snail shell concentration found with Burial 2. The associated artifacts with this feature are
proximal halves of two biface Form 3 specimens.
INTRAZONE CULTURAL DISTURBANCES. These apparent disturbances comprise undulations in the contact between Zones D and E. They
represent possible hearth pits or other forms of cultural activities. They are
marked simply by variations in burned rock size and change in sediment
color. They also indicate the degree of disturbance that can occur between
two components within a burned rock midden.

Midden D
Midden D is the smallest midden (16 x 21 ft). It is 120 ft due south of
Midden C, on the south edge of Ledge #2. It generally had a depth of less
than 6 in.
Because of its shallowness and narrow dimensions, this midden was
tested by a single 5 x 5 ft square. The midden sediment was black and very
compact. The single zone contained fire cracked rocks of medium size, grading to large in the northern half of the square. Rabdotus snail shells were quite
common but appear to be smaller than those found in Midden C.

Midden E
Midden E (Fig. 7), which might be called a ring midden, is about 100 ft
southwest of Midden C. This midden is centrally located in the site, overlooking Cottonwood Creek rather than Little Bear Creek. The portion of Ledge
#I below Midden E no longer constitutes a bluff but grades into a steep slope
to the flood plain below.
Midden E is of medium size relative to the other middens. Its longest axis is
along a southeast to northwest line. Its dimensions are 65 × 40 ft. Its greatest
depth, 24 in, was at the center.
The midden was undisturbed prior to excavation. There was a slight depression about 10 ft in diameter at its center, giving it a ring appearance. The
depression, indicating a possible central pit, is most noticeable from the uphill
side. In order to bisect the depression parallel to the midden axis, a southeastnorthwest line was set. Seven 5 × 5 ft squares were excavated along the
southwest side of the line. Beginning at the southeast point, N00!W250,
squares were designated A through G. Each square was excavated in arbitrary 6 in levels with vertical measurements being made from the highest and
easternmost corner of each square.
Three zones of occupation, designated A through C, are represented in
the profiles (Fig. 7).
Zone A: This is the basal zone and covers the bedrock floor of all squares except a section in
square E and the southeast half of square A~ This zone is dark brown in color with
occasional lenses of ashy brown sediment oecuring throughout it. Zone sediment is
particularly noted for its extreme friability~ The zone seems to be lighter in color near
bedrock. As this zone increases in thickness, it becomes darker at its upper margins.
Flagstones and bedrock spalls occur frequently throughout with about an equal number
of fire cracked rocks present. Medium sized rocks are most conspicuous. This zone is in
contact with both Zones B and C. Where it underlies B, the amount of cultural debris

present was quite low; while that area under C provided a greater number of artifacts.
Squares F and G were especially productive.
Zone B: The sediment of Zone B is very compact and brown to almost black at the top. This zone
was recognized at the surface in squares A, B, and C. Burned and fire cracked rock
constitute very high percentage of midden matrix (about 70% rock to 30% sediment).
Gravel and medium and large burned rocks occur throughout this zone. Larger rocks
are most conspicuous in squares B and especially C. Although flint flakes, snail shells,
and other minor habitational indicators are common in this zone, artifact yield was quite
~OW.

Zone C: This zone represents the last major occupation at Midden E and is the largest component investigated. It occurs in squares C through G and is demarcated from Zone B in
square C by a marked change of burned rock size. The angle between Zones B and C is
almost 40°; rocks in Zone B at this point are large while those in Zone C at this point are
medium to gravel size. The distinction between Zones C and A at their contact is less
conspicuous. It was determined mainly by the friability of Zone A.
Zone C sediment is black to brown in color. Percentage of rock to sediment may be
slightly less in Zone C than in B. As Zone C grades away from B, the rock size increases.
Almost boulder size rocks appeared in the lower levels Qf squares D, E, and F and then
diminishing somewhat in G. This situation is due in part to the most outstanding feature
found at Greenhaw. The slight central depression was a large pit penetrating Zones C to
A, in squares D and E.
Artifact yield of Zone C was very high. The zone produced the predominant type of
dart point found in Midden E, that of Bulverde (Variety 11). Amount of snail remains
found was far below that of Zones A or B. An increased amount of gravel was noted in
the top level of squares F and G.
Zone D: This is a noncultural zone that is mostly a black humus with inclusions of erosional debris
from upslope. The sediment and gravel found within the central pit, although probably
identical in origin, are tabulated separately from Zone D. Both post-date the burned
rock midden.

MIDDENE-FEATURE 1. PIT (Fig. 8): This feature is a large pit, primarily in Zone C, that was bisected by the trench, appearing in squares D and E.
Originally, the pit was about 10 ft in diameter and centrally located in the
midden. It was lined with large rocks at its base and along its north wall (Fig.
7). When abandoned, the pit filled with erosional debris (gravel, sand, black
humus, artifacts, etc.). It was then capped by the humic Zone D. The pit
apparently represents the last major activity at the midden since cultural disturbance was not noted through the pit.
MIDDEN E-FEATURE 2. SNAIL SHELL CONCENTRATION: This
feature consisted of a dense concentration of Rabdotus snails in square B at
the contact between Zones A and B. This concentration measured I x 1.9 x
0.3 ft.

Midden F
Midden F is the largest of the nine middens (105 x 85 ft), with a maximum depth of 50 in. Its longest axis is oriented southeast to northwest. The
lower margins encroach onto Ledge #I. At this point, Ledge #I is level with
the flood plain of Cottonwood Creek and appears only as a flat exposure of
bedrock with the top sediment eroded. The southeastern and uppermost
edge of Midden F begins at Ledge #2 and dips away rather steeply since the
slope cuts back into the hill at the west of the midden.
This midden was initially vandalized in 1917 (earliest recollection of
several residents of San Marcos, Texas). About 75/% of the midden was
destroyed by such activity. In an attempt to obtain an artifact sample from the

20

Texas Archeological Society

midden, areas were selected that showed little or no evidence of being disturbed. Three 5 × 5 ft squares were excavated in the southern portion of the
midden and a unit 5 x 8 ft was excavated in the central part. All were
oriented with magnetic north and excavated in arbitrary 6 in levels to bedrock.
Excavation showed the midden to have five major zones (Fig. 8). An
attempt was made to distinguish intrazonal characteristics by noting change in
size of burned rock; however, unlike Middens C and E where this was possible, it proved impossible at this midden. In all zones, small to large burned
rock was present and mixed. Zones were best distinguished by sediment
texture and color, amount of gravel present, and minor habitational debris
such as snail shells and flint flakes.
Zone A: This basal zone appeared as a veneer over the bedrock. It reached 12 in in thickness at one point but was usually less than 6 in thick. It is light brown in color where it
overlies hard limestone and more tan where it covers a softer marl. Unburned flagstones
and bedrock spalls are common throughout with about an equal amount of fire cracked
rock present. In the central portion, it becomes more friable where there was less mixing
with decaying bedrock. Huge boulders and Rabdotus snail shells are common. Flint
flakes are scarce, occuring as large percussion spalls. Few artifacts and thinning flakes
are present.
Zone B: This zone is found only in the central test unit and one of three squares at the
southern end. It is thick, over 24 in at one point, and penetrates to bedrock in one
square. Rock sizes are completely mixed and rocks are burned. The sediment is grey
black and very ashy. Lithic debris is unusually scarce; snail shells few, and in some parts,
artifacts and flint flakes nonexistent.
Zone C: The sediment is brown to black. Fire cracked rocks make up a very high percentage of zone fill. Zone criteria are extremely high percentage of gravel, whole and
crushed snail shells, flint flakes, and artifacts. The zone is found only in the southern
portion of the midden. Its lower margins are in contact with both Zones A and B.
Zone C is slightly lighter in color at its contact with Zone A.
Zone D: Found in all areas excavated, Zone D is the most extensive and covers Zones B
and C. The sediment is black in color and very compact. Color is in part due to recent
humic activity which also penetrates the uppermost limits of Zones B and C. Burned
rock constitutes about 70% of zone fill and grades from medium to large. Although
some areas seems to have one size dominating, there was no distinct demarcation
between areas with different rock size. Pea gravel occurs in small lenses. Amount of snail

shells, flint flakes, and artifacts was high; however, these materials were not as concentrated as in Zone C.
Zone E: This zone is primarily a post-midden, depositional feature which caps much of the
midden, filling depressions and other surface irregularities The sediment is very black
and compact. It contains few rocks and those are pebble size. Flint flakes and other
cultural items occur, apparently washed in from upslope.

Midden G
At one time, this midden occupied an area 35 x 50 ft, with its longest axis
running southeast to northwest. Midden G is located below and 50 ft to the
west of Midden F, on the flats created by Cottonwood Creek. The limestone
bedrock at the base of this midden constitutes Ledge # 1 to the east.
Areas for testing were extremely limited since at least 90% of the midden
was destroyed by a relic collector using a front-end loader. Two test units were
placed in the eastern and southern peripheries to obtain an artifact sample; a
third test (3 x 5 ft) was excavated in a small, undisturbed hummock left in the
south-center section. The lowest level in the latter reached a maximum depth
of 20 in.
The revealed zones cannot be considered representative of the entire
midden; however, they indicated the cultural sequence. Midden G bridges
the Clear Fork and Round Rock phases. Three district zones were noted.
Zone A: Sediment in the basal zone is reddish brown. It contains numerous bedrock spalls
and a few burned rocks. Percentage of rock to sediment was about 50/50. Cultural
debris occured throughout the zone.
Zone B: Sediment is dark brown to black, very compact, penetrated by modern rootlets,
and stained by decayed organic matter. Rocks are burned and of medium size. Percentage of rock to dirt is about 60% to 40%. Rabdotus snail shells occurred in quantity and
the number of artifacts recovered was high. This was probably one of the richest zones
from any midden on the site.
Zone C: This zone is essentially sterile. Sediment is black and very compact, being of recent
organic origin. In appearance, it compares with Zone E of Midden F.

MIDDEN G-FEATURE 1. ROCK CONCENTRATION: This feature,
3 ft diameter mounding of large and medium burned rocks in Zone B, was
similar to those noted in Midden B. Percentage of rock to dirt is about 80% to
20%. One Marshall and two Pedernales (Varieties I and 11) dart points, one
Knife Form 2, one distal fragment of a biface, one piece of red ochre, and 36
percussion flint flakes were found in the feature. Non-artifactual material included 17 fragments of mammal (deer?) long bone, numerous mature snail
shells (Rabdotus, Helicina, and Polygyra), and three snail shells of Mesodon.
This feature possibly represents a single dumping of debris (Sorrow, 1969;
Hester, 1970).

SURFACE COLLECTIONS
Certain middens and selected areas were not excavated but extensive
surface samples were made (Fig. 2).
Midden A
This midden is located at the eastern end of the site. It measures 60 x
40 ft, with its longest axis running north to south. Depth was undetermined

22

Texas Archeological Society

but probably at least 18 in. The large bifacials and dart points (Zorra, Tortugas, and Pedernales) recovered may indicate a history similar to that of Midden C.

Midden H
This midden is on the flats below Middens F and G, 40 ft due west of
Midden G, overlooking Cottonwood Creek. It measures 50 x 40 ft, with its
longest axis northwest to southeast. Depth was undetermined and surface
artifacts were rare.

Midden I
This midden is situated at the marl base of the slope at the western extremity of the site. It is separated from the other middens, the nearest (Midden H)
being 250 ft to the northeast. It is somewhat crescentric in shape with a depression in its uphill side. The midden measures 45 x 30 ft, with its longest
axis from east to west. The depth and association were undetermined.
Surface Area I
This area is the lower slope of the hillside overlooking Little Bear Creek
between the bluff and Ledge #2 and between Middens A and C. Middens A
and B, although within the confines of the area, are considered as separate
units. A surface feature is a concentration of cracked hearth stones slightly
more than 100 ft west of Midden A. It covers an area 15 ft in diameter, with
no depth.

Surface Area II
This area is directly uphill from Surface Area I and has the same east-west
limits. The artifactual material comes primarily from Ledges #2, #3, and #4.
As elsewhere in the site, the concentration of artifacts and chipping debris is
heaviest where a burned rock midden (in this case, Middens A, B, and C) is
directly below.
Surface Area III
This area includes the central portion of Ledge #I and the slope above
that ledge to Ledge #2. It is bounded by Midden C to the east and Midden F to
the west. Although Midden E and most of Middens C and F are included in
this area, they are dealt with separately. Most artifacts recovered seem to
relate to Midden E and F; chipping debris is particularly heavy on Ledge #1
below Midden E.
Surface Area IV
One of the smallest surface areas, it includes part of Ledges #2, #3, and
#4 and extends from Midden D, situated on Ledge #2 to the east, to Midden F
to the west. The dart points found are from the Clear Fork phase.

Weir- Greenhaw

23

Surface Area V
This area is a triangular section fanning out to the northwest from Midden
F. It includes a large exposure of Ledge #I and the area on the flats below
Ledge #1. The artifacts found on the exposure of Ledge #I are like those
found within Midden F.
A surface feature is made up of two concentrations of thermal fractured
chert cobbles. Both concentrations are on the Ledge #1 exposure directly
below Midden F and were probably associated with that midden. The smaller
of the concentrations, which is nearest Midden F, contained 87 cobbles and
covered an area 12 ft in diameter. The larger concentration had 134 cobbles
and was 16 ft in diameter.
Cobbles ranged from 7 to 20 cm in diameter. They are siliceous material
that occurs naturally on the hill above the middens. Because of the nature of
the cobbles and random arrangement, it does not appear that they were
hearth stones; they may have been used for stone boiling (T.N. Campbell,
personal communication). This type of chert cobble occurs as isolated specimens in most of the middens.

Surface Area VI
This area lies between Middens F and I and extends down the slope below
Ledge #2 to the flood plain of Cottonwood Creek. Scattered artifacts and
chipping debris are scarce.

Surface Area VII
This area is directly above Surface Area VI and includes the western
portions of Ledges #2, #3, and #4. There is little indication of habitation even
though Middens G, H, and I occur below.

Surface Area VIII
This area is the valley floor on the north side of Little Bear Creek, across
from the site proper. It includes the area on either side of the old creek channel. Dart point types found include unidentified Paleoindian fragments,
Buda, Carrizo, Ensor, Figueroa, and Lange, indicating a temporal span from
Paleoindian through Archaic.

ARTIFACT ANALYSIS
The artifacts, after being cleaned and catalogued, were divided into categories of chipped stone, miscellaneous stone, bone, shell, etc. These categories were subdivided morphologically according to names customarily used
(i.e., bifaces, unifaces, choppers, drills, etc.) and previously devised type
names.
Provenience of each artifact type is given in terms of zones within each
midden in Tables 1 through 6. Where the arbitrary 6 in levels cross cut or
were located on contact areas of different zones, an indication notes that the

24

Texas Archeological Society

artifact cannot be placed in either of the two zones, For example, where
provenience is given as Zone B-C, the artifacts are found at the transition of
Zones B and C. Those artifacts that are known to come from the pit located in
Midden E, squares D and E, are given the provenience of Feature 1--Pit. For
those artifacts in Midden E that occurred at the contact of the pit and Zone C,
the provenience indication is C-Pit.
Type names used for projectile points are those of Shum et al. (1954),
with additional types Gower (Shafer 1963), Figueroa and Zorra (Johnson
1964), Carrizo (Hester and House 1963), and a tentative new type, Buda
(Weir, 1967). There are seven provisional types and miscellaneous categories.
Types are standardized and thorough descriptions found in other publications. Complete descriptions are omitted except where varieties and new
types warrant it. However, non-projectile point iithics are given more descriptive attention. Morphological divisions within the various categories do not
necessarily follow those of other authors and in some cases, have proved
important in Weir’s (1976) definition of Archaic phases.

ARTIFACTS OF CHIPPED STONE
The great majority of artifacts found at the Greenhaw site are of chipped
stone. The heavier items, such as choppers and large bifaces, were made
from coarse grained siliceous material obtained in the immediate area. Thinner bifaces, such as dart points, were made from fine grained Central Texas
cherts. This material was probably obtained from distant stream channels or
quarried from outcrops in areas other than the site vicinity.

Arrow Points
SCALLORN (I Specimen): one of three artifacts found at the site attributable to postArchaic times.
YOUNG (1 Specimen): a type now thought to be a preform rather than finished form.
ARROWPOINT FRAGMENT (1 Specimen): positive identification not possible.

Large Stemmed Bifaces
CONTRACTING STEM (7 Specimens; Fig. 9A-B): blades broad and triangular; stems
contract to extremely convex or slightly concave bases, Such specimens have been typed Almagre (Suhm et al., 1954).
LARGE STRAIGHT STEM (3 Specimens; Fig. 9C-D): blade leaf-shaped to triangular;
shoulders are rounded to slightly barbed.
LARGE EXPANDING STEM (5 Specimens; Fig. 9E-F) : blades appear to have had slightly
convex to slightly recurved edges; strong shoulders or slight barbs prominent; stems broad and
slightly expanding with concave bases (one exception); stem edges smoothed.

Dart Points
BUDA, tentative new type (20 Specimens; Fig. 10A-C): blades slender and leaf-shaped;
slightly twisted blade or slightly beveled stem or both; stems slight to almost nonexistent; where
discernable, stem seldom more than I/4 total length of point, and generally from I/5 to I/6 total
length; stem edges slightly expanding to straight and sometimes smoothed; base slightly convex
to slightly concave; flaking totally percussion on cruder specimens.

An increasing amount of pressure flaking occurs as workmanship improves. Workmanship
varies from poor to good. Usually, points are thick relative to their width. L: 5.5 to 9.5 cml MW:
2.2 to 2.7 cm; MT: 0.8 to 1~1 cm.
This type, previously described (Weir, 1967:39), does not occur frequently in sites. When it
does, it is usually classed as Travis, Nolan, or Pandale. Ray (1938:198-199) was probably the
first to recognize it as a type: his Clear Fork I. Kelly (1947:97) lumped Ray’s Clear Fork I and II
into the type Nolan Beveled Stem.
A smaller variety of the Buda type, termed Provisional Type 1, was recognized by Nunley
(Nunley et al., 1965:57) as occuring with Pandale dart points. The type was noted but referred to
as Nolan~Pandale-Like (Shafer, 1967:49) in the Robert Lee Reservoir Survey (Coke County,
Texas). The Buda type seems to have a different distribution from those it resembles (Travis,
Nolan, and Pandale). These types were not found in the Robert Lee Reservoir survey (Shafer,
1967).
In Midden C at Greenhaw, this type is restricted to the southwestern portion of the middem
types Nolan and Travis show no particular clustering and Pandale does not occur. However,
both Buda and Nolan are numerous in Zones D-E and F. Buda occurred at Parida Cave, Val
Verde County (Alexander, 1970:22). At Coontail Spin, Val Verde County, Pandale was found
from Zone A-3 (near the top) to 11 ft below the surface; provisional Type 1 occurred with
Pandale at depths from 5 to 9 ft below the surface (Nunley et al., 1965:Table 2)~ It would seem
that the Buda type may have experienced popularity during part of the same time range as the
Nolan type in Central Texas and Pandale type in the Trans-Pecos area.
Of Travis, Nolan, and Pandale, the Buda type more closely resembles Pandale. It differs
from Pandale in that its range in size is greater~ it does not have parallel flaking~ is more crudely
made~ and has a different distribution.
ABASOLO (1 Specimen): basally thinned; triangular~ convex base.
ANGOSTURA (3 Specimem Fig. 9D-J)
Two specimens from Midden C are small proximal sections with rechipped distal ends (one
made into a drill).
ANGOSTURA-PLAINVIEW (i Specimem Fig. 9G): slender lanceolate blade with slightly
expanding corners at the base~ lateral edges smoothed near base~ flaking oblique parallel and
inclined from lower to upper right; base slightly concave and slightly bifacially beveled.
This specimen compares well with similar artifacts recovered from the Levi Rockshelter, a
Paleoindian site located 20 mi northwest of Greenhaw (Alexander, 1963:514, Fig. 2C, D).
BULVERDE, VARIETY I (59 Specimens~ Fig. 11A-C): strong shouldered to barbed with
triangular blades~ stems rectangular to slightly contracting, constituting about I/3 the total length
of the point; basal thinning by short longitudinal flakes~ bases straight to slightly convex.
This is a major Early Archaic type and second only to the Pedernales type in the Middle
Archaic (Johnson et al., 1962:121). It is a type that transcends the end of the Clear Fork and
beginning of the Round Rock Phases. It is the predominant point type from Midden C.
BULVERDE, VARIETY II (40 Specimens~ Fig. 11D-E): blades triangular with straight to
slightly convex edges that are sometimes parallel just above the shoulders~ shoulders prominent
but rarely barbed; stems rectangular and usually convex; basal thinning lacking. Variety II is
somewhat narrower in blade and stem width than Variety I. Specimens of Variety II are frequently found with rechipped or reshaped blades.
At the Landslide site, this variety was found along with similar specimens with longer and
narrower stems which were referred to as Bulverde-Like (Sorrow et al., 1967:14). In Midden C,
this variety, unlike Variety I, occurs in Zone DI however, it is most numerous in the peripheral
Zone F. In Midden E, 13 specimens of Variety II and two of Variety I were found. At present, it is
not clear which is the earlier variety although separation of the two seems valid.
BULVERDE VARIETY III (6 Specimens~ Fig. 1 IF-H) : blades triangular with slightly convex
edges; stems narrow and contracting~ average length of stem longer than in Varieties I and II~
bases slightly concave.
CARRIZO (1 Specimem Fig. 10T): blade edges and base slightly convex and corners
rounded~ single notch in center of base. Primary distribution of this type is southwest Texas
(Nunley and Hester, 1966).

GOWER, VARIETY I (I Specimen; Fig. 9M): blade triangular with a slight beveling twist to
the left; stem expanding, deeply notched, and lateral edges smoothed; stem almost I/2 the total
length; multiple burin blows on both shoulders.
This specimen varies from the type specimens in the twisting of the blade and stem width
(Shafer, 1963). However, it does compare well with Gower-like points found in Llano County,
Texas (Crawford, 1965: 76-78) and is similar to Baker points from Val Verde County (Word and
Douglas, 1970:21).
GOWER, VARIETY II (I Specimen; Fig. 9N): triangular blade; slight shoulders; contracting, bifurcated stem; lateral edges of stem unifacially beveled; no noticeable attempt to thin the

base.
This specimen was found at the maximum depth of the basal zone in Midden F. It was deeper
than any other artifact and is considered the oldest dart point within that midden. Although this
specimen does not conform to specifications for a classic Gower type, it does closely resemble
Variant A (Shafer, 1963: Fig. 7G).
LANGE (8 Specimens; Fig. 12M-N)
LANGTRY (5 Specimens; Fig. 12A)
This type is quite common in West Texas extending down to the Rio Grande River. It occurs
in South Texas and Northeast Mexico as a minor type and rarely In Central Texas (Suhm et al.,
1954:438).
MARCOS (1 Specimen; Fig. 12J)
MARSHALL (4 Specimens; Fig. 12F-I)
Although generally considered a Late Archaic type, it was suggested that the Marshall type is
transitional between the Round Rock and San Marcos Phases (Weir, 1976; Denton, 1976).
MORRILL (i Specimen; Fig. 10L)
NOLAN, VARIETY I (41 Specimens; Fig. 10F-G): blades triangular to leaf-shaped; stems
alternately beveled on right side and rectangular to slightly expanding in outline.
At Midden C, only Bulverde and Travis points are more numerous than Nolan points. At
Midden G, Nolan is the dominant type.
NOLAN, VARIETY II (4 Specimens; Fig. 10H-I): stems alternately beveled to the right;
blades broad with marked alternate left bevels almost creating a twist.
The blade twist distinguishes this variety from Variety I. However, they are not to be confused with the Pandale type.
PALMILLAS (3 Specimens; Fig. 12E)
PANDORA (4 Specimens; Fig. 120)
PEDERNALES, VARIETY I (26 Specimens; Fig. 11f-J) : blades triangular and barbed; stem
edges parallel to slightly convex; base deeply to moderately concave; bases thinned by short
longitudinal flakes.
The Pedernales type is the predominant dart point type at Midden F and Variety I is the most
numerous of the three varieties.
PEDERNALES, VARIETY II (15 Specimens; Fig. IlK-M): narrower than Variety I; slight
shouldered.
PEDERNALES, VARIETY III (9 Specimens; Fig. 11N-P)
These specimens are identical with a variety found at the Wunderlich site, Comal County,
Texas (Johnson et al., 1962:25). It seems to occur later in time that Varieties I and II.
PEDERNALES, MISCELLANEOUS (15 Specimens; Fig. IIQ-S)
This category may represent stemmed knives (Suhm, 1959:236).
SHUMLA (1 Specimen; Fig. 12B)
Shumla points occur in norther Tamaulipas, Mexico and is most common in West Texas,
extending down the Rio Grande into South Texas. It occurs only rarely in Central Texas (Suhm
et al., 1954:480).
TORTUGAS (30 Specimens; Fig. 10R-S): triangular, stemless point; blade and base edges
straight to slightly convex; strong basal thinning, producing a narrow edge-like longitudinal section; alternately beveled to the left (4 specimens) or to the right (3 specimens).
Tortugas is one of four major dart point types from Midden C and has the same horizontal
distribution as the Nolan type. It occurs over most of Midden C, but appears most numerous in
Zone F in the western section. Tortugas occurs in numbers great enough to be considered a major
type in a Central Texas burned rock midden.
Hester (1971) refers to them as Early Triangular and Late Triangular. In a site near San
Antonio (Texas), Hester and Kohnitz (1975) found them in extremely early Archaic context.
Weir (1976) placed them in both the San Geronimo and Clear Fork Phases. They definitely
belong to the Early Archaic period.

TRAVIS (41 Specimens: Fig. 10D-E): lateral basal smoothing (three specimens).
The Travis type is found stratigraphically only in Middens C and E where it is a major point
type.
UVALDE (3 Specimens: Fig. 90-P)
WELLS (2 Specimens; Fig 10M-N)
The Wells type is usually found in Archaic components in East Texas sites but occurs rarely in
Early Archaic context in Central Texas (Shafer, 1962).
WILLIAMS (2 Specimens)
ZORRA (18 Specimens: Fig. 10J-K): blades triangular to leaf-shaped; in outline, closely
resemble Nolan but stem generally narrower: both edges of stem unifacially beveled on same face
(diagnostic attribute).
PROVISIONAL TYPE I (7 Specimens; Fig. 13A-C): deeply corner notched points; small
triangular blades, barbed to strongly barbed: stems slightly expanding to strongly expanding:
base concave to slightly concave: blades (2 specimens) show slight rechipping by pressure.
This type represents a San Geronimo Phase component and is one of the earliest forms at
the site. It may be related to the "Early Barbed" varieties from the Devils Mouth site (Johnson,
1964: Figure 11, J-S) and Devils Rockshelter (Prewitt, 1966:216). One specimen is identical to
the Early Archaic Untyped II (Shafer, 1963) from the Landslide site (Sorrow et al., 1967:22).
PROVISIONAL TYPE II (4 Specimens: Fig. 13D-F): blades convex and somewhat parallel
edged near shoulders: strong shoulders: bases thinned and slightly concave: stems long with
straight to slightly convex edges, giving them a slight bulbous appearance with sharp corners;
lateral edges sometimes smoothed.
One dart point of this type was found underlying points of the Clear Fork Phase at the
Landslide site and was classed as an untyped group 1 (Sorrow et al., 1967:20).
PROVISIONAL TYPE III (4 Specimens; Fig. 13G-I) : small triangular blade with small barbs;
small rectangular stem: concave base: stems longer than wide: light beveling (3 specimens) on
left side of stem carried up under the barb.
This type bears a close similarity to Langtry and Val Verde points.
PROVISIONAL TYPE IV (5 Specimens; Fig. 13J-L): small side notched dart points: stubby
blades: stems expanding with straight to slightly concave edges: corners sharp: base slightly
convex; stem about 1/3 total length of point; thick wedge-shaped longitudinal section due to
very little basal thinning.
PROVISIONAL TYPE VII (9 Specimens; Fig. 13Q-R): blade narrow, triangular with
straight to slightly convex edges: shoulders weak to prominent; stem I/4 to I/5 total length of
point and slightly concave: base usually slightly concave but can be straight: bilateral symmetry
almost perfect.
UNCLASSIFIED DART POINTS (44 Specimens).
In every artifact collection there are those projectile points that do not fall into recognized
type categories, do not occur in adequate numbers to justify a provisional or tentative type
category, and are left as artifactual anomalies and remain unclassified. The unclassified
Greenhaw ones are triangular and notched. Six specimens deserve special attention because of
their provenience below what were at one time considered the oldest Archaic types in Central
Texas. These specimens probably belong to the San Geronimo Phase and are from Midden B.
With the exception of specimens C and F, the unclassified points were found in the lower zones,
A and B. They reflect the earliest occupation at this midden and possibly at the site since they
underlie the Early Archaic types Traves, Bulverde, and Tortugas.
(Fig. 13S): stubby blade with slightly recurved edges; point side notched and barbs present,
although one removed by a lateral blow; stem I/3 total length of specimen and slightly bulbous in
character; slightly expanding stem with rounded corners and convex base.
(Fig. 13T): short; blade with convex edges; slightly shouldered; stem produced by shallow
side notches: base slightly concave; stem slightly more than I/4 total length of point; one side
notch bifacially chipped, while other side notch and slight basal concavity produced by low angle
unifacial beveling; lateral edges of stem smoothed: in outline, stem vaguely resembles those of
the Martindale type. (Suhm et al., 1954:446).
This specimen bears resemblance to the one above only in that it is stemmed. Both were
found in close proximity.
(Fig. 13U) : blade of specimen fractured but probably triangular, with either straight or slightly
convex edges; deeply corner notched: stem strongly expanding: barbs prominent: base slightly
concave.

There is a mere suggestion of recurving to the base similar to that found on the Martindale
type. However, this specimen’s stem flares more and is shorter than stems of the Martindale type.

It bears some similarity to the Edgewood type (Suhm et al., 1954:418) and Provisional Type 1.
It also strongly resembles Early Corner Notched, Variety I. (Hester, 1971:72).
(Fig. 13V): blade broad, stubby, and triangular; basally notched, creating barbs with flat tips;
stem with short parallel edges and straight base.
(Fig. 13W): small, lanceolate dart point; base slightly convex and unifacially beveled; lateral
edges near base smoothed.
This specimen was the deepest found in the midden.
(Fig. 13X): proximal portion of a lanceolate biface; blade with convex edges, expanding
slightly at base; base slightly concave and thinned by short longitudinal flakes; lateral edges and
basal corners lightly smoothed; in outline, closely resembles Plainview Golindrina variety (Johnson, 1965:46, 48-49).
UNIDENTIFIED PALEOINDIAN POINT FRAGMENTS (2 Specimens): Specimen I (Fig.
9K)--distal section of a collaterally flaked dart point; Specimen 2 (Fig. 9L)--large proximal
fragment of a dart point; blade fractured just above lateral edge smoothing; distal-proximal burin
facet crossed specimen obliquely, removing one edge and the base.
UNIDENTIFIED PALEOINDIAN POINT FRAGMENTS (167 Specimens)
BIFACE FORM 1 (18 Specimens; Fig. 14A): large leaf-shaped bifaces with moderately
convex to strongly convex blade edges; distal end pointed.
Specimens constrict toward the base giving the appearance of a bipointed tool. The base is
one of the most diagnostic attributes in that it retains the nodule cortex or prepared platform of the
original flake. The artifacts are usually thick, but about 40% are well thinned. L: 10.6 to 13.7 cm.
At Midden C, this form is most numerous in Zones D and F in the southwest part of the
midden. This type is attributed to the Clear Fork Phase.
BIFACE FORM 2 (23 Specimens; Fig. 14B): blade edges convex, contracting near the base:
in a few specimens, lateral edges near base almost parallel: bases slightly concave to slightly
convex. L: 10 to approx. 14 cm.
These specimens are similar to Biface Form 1, with the exception that the bases were thinned
and cortex removed. This form occurs stratigraphically associated with Bulverde Varieties I and II
in Middens C, E, and F. It is attributed to the Clear Fork Phase.
BIFACE FORM 3 (80 Specimens; Fig. 14C): blades broad with slight to strongly convex
edges; edges often parallel near the base; base slightly convex with rounded corners. L: 8 to
15 cm.
This form seems to be universal and cannot be attributed to a particular phase~
BIFACE FORM 4 (22 Specimens; Fig~ 14D) : blades broad and triangular with slightly convex edges; basal corners usually sharp; base straight to slightly concave; well thinned. L: 8.0 to
10.5 cm.
BIFACE FORM 5 (32 Specimens; Fig. 14E) : blades triangular and slightly convex with sharp
to slightly rounded basal corners; some blade edges nearly parallel towards base; bases usually
straight, but vary from slightly convex to slightly concave. L: 6.0 to 8.5 cm.
BIFACE FORM 6 (20 Specimens; Fig. 14F): triangular blades; most with slightly convex
blade edges; some more slender specimens with crudely recurved edges; bases slightly convex to
straight, with slightly rounded corners. L: 5.8 to 9.0 cm.
BIFACE FORM 7 (53 Specimens; Fig. 14G): blade edges convex to strongly convex; cornets absent and rounded. L: 7.2 to 13.0 cm.
BIFACE FORM 8 (24 Specimens; Fig. 14H): oval to crudely rectangular; only one or two
edges thinned, with many showing use on these edges; corners rounded and edges convex, hi
6.0 to 12.0 cm.
BIFACE FORM 9 (18 Specimens; Fig. 141): slender biface blades, usually asymmetrical:
edges convex; bases irregular, sometimes showing remnants of a prepared platform. L: 7~3 to
10.0 cm.
This biface form is found only in Middens C and E where the Bulverde type of dart point is
the dominant type.
BIFACE FORM I0 (24 Specimens; Fig. 14J): broad asymmetrical biface blades; both edges
usually convex, with one edge more convex than the other; bases roughly straight to slightly
convex, several specimens exhibiting a large portion of the original striking platform. L: 5.0 to
11.0 cm.
BIFACE FORM 11 (11 Specimens; Fig. 14K): crude, roughly oval bifaces; characterized by
preparation of only one cutting edge while opposite edge exhibiting extreme thickness, prepared
platform, and/or cortex; blades pointed; base irregularly shaped or rounded. L: 6.8 to 12.2 cm.
Workmanship improves considerably toward the distal end.

BIFACE FORM 12 (16 Specimens; Fig. 15A)
These are probably flake knives that are unifacially chipped around the edges except at the
tip where fine bifacial work is exhibited. All retain the curvature of the original flake, resulting in a
plano-convex to keep shaped profile. L: 5.5 to 13.0 cm.
BIFACE FORM 13 (4 Specimens; Fig. 15B): blade edges convex; distal end rounded to
slightly pointed. L: 7.5 to 9.0 cm.
There was no attempt to remove the cortex from the proximal section. Where chipping has
occurred at the base, it resulted in beveling at about an 80° angle.
BIFACE FORM 14 (3 Specimens; Fig~ 15C) : thick oval bifaces with convex edges: one with
rounded base, while others slightly concave; slightly pointed; lateral edges showing extreme use,
demonstrating combined cutting and chopping. L: 10.3 to 11.5 cm.
BIFACE FORM 15 (5 Specimens; Fig. 15D): small, roughly Ionzenge shaped blades; angle
on tl~e lateral edge more distinct on one edge than on other. L: 7 to 9 cm.
BIFACE FORM 16 (5 Specimens: Fig~ 15E): almost bipointed, one end being more sharply
pointed than the other; one edge straight to slightly convex while other strongly convex; thickest
at the straight side, indicating strongly convex side probably the cutting edge. L: 8.5 to 12.3 cm,
BIFACE FORM 17 (3 Specimens; Fig. 15F): small; bases straight; corners sharp; edges
convex. L: 6.7 to 7.9 cm.
BIFACE FORM 18 (3 Specimens; Fig. 15G): slender, blade edges parallel to very slightly
convex; base straight. L: 9 to 10 cm.
These specimens are very similar to parallel edged knives from the Belton Reservoir (Shafer
et al., 1964:47).
BIFACE FORM 19 (67 Specimens; Fig. 15H-I) : very crude heavy bifaces; ranging in shape
from roughly triangular to roughly bipointed. L: 7.5 to 12.3 cm~
BIFACE FORM 20 (16 Specimens; Fig. 15J): almost round in outline; on some specimens,
portion of one edge retouched more than remaining edges, Maximum dimension: 5 to 12 cm.
The highest concentration of this form was in Midden C. It is apparently an important biface
in both the San Geronimo and Clear Fork Phases. They were previously classifed as oval bifaces
(Weir, 1967).
UNIDENTIFIED BIFACE FRAGMENTS (651 Specimens)
This category includes all biface fragments other than projectile points.
BIFACE BLANKS (36 Specimens) : percussion thinned bifaces showing no use but exhibiting a crude attempt at removing cortex of original pebble or large initial cortex flake from which
they appear to have been made.
These specimens are called blanks because of the thinning process employed here which is
preparatory to shaping. Twenty specimens retain little or no cortex.
PERFORATORS (17 Specimens; Fig. 16A-B)
Four specimens are perforator bits broken from the original artifacts. Six are bits chipped on
distal ends of blades of stemmed dart points. Two are chipped on blades of stemless dart points;
four on the distal ends of biface forms; and one on the proximal end of a biface. All exhibit light
percussion and pressure flaking. They apparently were made from complete or fragmentary
biface artifacts and were made from flakes.
CHOPPER FORM 1 (14 Specimens; Fig. 16C): bifacially chipped, retaining a large portion
of nodule cortex opposite working edge; chopping bit rounded to somewhat pointed.
CHOPPER FORM 2 (4 Specimens; Fig. 16D): somewhat oval to rectangular in outline;
bifacially chipped; most cortex removed and batter scars present on ends.
CHOPPER FORM 3 (9 Specimens; Fig. 16E).
These tools are examples of Core Forms 1 and 2 which were converted to chopping tools.
The longest edge is the one most utilized as a tool.
CHOPPER FORM 4 (5 Specimens; Fig. 16F): roughly rectangular bifaces, showing battering at one end due to chopping; most retaining a large portion of cortex on one side and
proximal end.
CHOPPER FORM 5 (11 Specimens; Fig. 16G): large, heavy percussion flakes having little
or no intentional alteration; batter scars present on one or more edges.
GOUGE FORM 1 (2 Specimens; Fig. 17A): thick, plano-convex; bifacially chipped; bit
convex and angles steeply from planar face.
GOUGE FORM 2 (8 Specimens; Fig. 17B): bifacially chipped; thick; convex bits beveled at
an angle between 30° and 45°; edges roughly parallel.
This form and Form i are attributed to the San Geronimo Phase (Weir, 1976).
GOUGE FORM 3 (4 Specimens; Fig. 17C): roughly triangular, bifadal; concave bits with
unifacial beveling.

They are a type of Clear Fork Gouge (Ray, 1938:197).
GOUGE FORM 4 (16 Specimens; Fig. 17D): triangular bifacials; bit edges convex.
The thicker specimens would fit well into the Clear Fork classification (Ray, 1938:197).
GOUGE FORM 5 (8 Specimens; Fig. 17E); unifacial; plano-convex and triangular in outline: bits and edges slightly convex.
This form is what Ray called a planar-gouge of the Clear Fork Culture (Ray, 1938:198).
ADZE (2 Specimens; Fig. 17F)
These specimens are unique in the collection. One specimen from Midden C is roughly
rectangular in outline, square in cross section, and wedge-shaped in longitudinal section (Fig.
29L). What is apparently the cutting bit is straight and shows use but no intentiona! alteration.
Lateral edges are unifacially chipped by percussion. An angle of 90° is reached on one edge and
105° on the other edge where the planar face meets the sides. These angles diminish towards the
distal and proximal ends.
The other specimen is a large percussion flake, plano-convex in cross section, and unifacially
chipped. It is rectangular in shape. One side retains part of the original cortex; the other side was
steepened by small percussion flakes from the planar face. The convex face was flattened by a
single percussion flake that was struck from the proximal end and curved over and through the
original spall, creating a squared working edge. This edge or distal end shows use and moderate
unifacial modification.
SCRAPER FORM 1 (7 Specimens; Fig. 17G): flake tools with a unifacially beveled edge;
bifacial modification of edge apparent.
SCRAPER FORM 2 (5 Specimens; Fig. 17H): most made from heavy cortex flakes and
unifacially chipped; characterized by projection of one chipped side in the form of a large and
slightly rounded point or nose.
Weir (1976) placed this form in the Clear Fork Phase.
SCRAPER FORM 3 (18 Specimens; Fig. 171): made from secondary and cortex hard hammer flakes: characterized by a single straight, unifacially chipped edge.
SCRAPER FORM 4 (52 Specimens: Fig. 17J): made from hard hammer percussion cortex
and secondary flakes; unifacially modified edge slightly convex to strongly convex.
SCRAPER FORM 5 (9 Specimens; Fig. 17K): single, slightly concave scraper edges; most
made on percussion cortex flakes, although secondary flakes common.
SCRAPER FORM 6 (3 Specimens; Fig. 17L): slightly crescent shaped: unifacially chipped
on two opposing edges; one edge convex while other concave.
SCRAPER FORM 7 (18 Specimens; Fig. 17M): crude end scrapers on rough, unshaped
spalls.
SCRAPER FORM 8 (70 Specimens; Fig. 17N): small; made from irregular secondary flakes
with one or more eages unifacially modified.
BURINS (51 Specimens; Fig. 18A-C)
Fourteen specimens were produced on hard hammer percussion flakes by removal of one or
more burin spalls along one edge. Eleven are dihedral burins.
Ten specimens were produced on bifacial fragments. They were produced by removing one
or more burin spalls from edges of either the distal or proximal ends of biface fragments. They
were struck from the snapped fracture of the original artifact. Three are proximal-distal while the
remainder are distal-proximal.
Twenty seven specimens were produced on projectile points. There are 16 that have distalproximal burin facets extending from the tip or a blade fracture. In most cases, these consist of
single burin blows; however, several specimens exhibit several multiple burin scars.
One specimen, a Bulverde (Variety II), has polyhedral burin flakes removed from one edge.
There is an example of burin flakes struck from the proximal end toward the distal end. Eight dart
points have small proximal-medial burin strokes removed from either the barbs or bases. These
run perpendicular to the center line of the point.
Types of projectile points found to possess burin facets are: Bulverde (Varieties I and II),
Castroville, Gower (Variety I), Nolan (Variety I), Pedernales (Varieties II and III), Tortugas,
Provisional Types I, IV, and VII, Paleoindian dart point fragments, and unclassified dart points.
BURIN SPALLS (6 Specimens)
These specimens were removed from biface implements~ From the edge workmanship,
indications are that one spall was removed from a dart point. Another specimen from Midden F
was found with its matching part, the base of a Biface Form 2. The other three specimens were
removed from heavier biface blades.
GRAVERS (49 Specimens; Fig. 18D) : small pointed projections chipped unifacially on flint
flakes and other unifacial tools (e.g., Biface Form 12); beaks often minute but range from 0.2 to
1.2 cm in length.

Two specimens have multiple beaks.
NOTCHES (13 Specimens; Fig. 18E)
Two specimens occur on bifaces and 11 are hard hammer percussion and soft hammer
thinning flakes that have small, semicircular notches unifacially chipped into them.
GRAVER-NOTCHES (3 Specimens; Fig. 18F) : combination tools unifacially chipped onto
percussion flakes, exhibiting shallow, semicircular, unifacially chipped notches and minute
graver beaks.
SERRATED FLAKES (3 Specimens; 18G)
Two specimens are percussion flakes, one with eight serrations chipped along one edge and
the other with five. The smallest specimen from Midden B is a small (2.7 cm) billet flake with
fifteen minute serrations in one edge and eighteen in the other. Serrated flakes are more commonly found in the San Geronimo Phase.
CORE FORM I (47 Specimens; Fig. 18H)
This form retains an appreciable amount of nodule cortex. Specimens have multiple platforms and are still large enough so that additional, useable flakes could have been removed.
CORE FORM 2 (26 Specimens; Fig. 181)
This form differs from Form 1 in that most or all of the cortex was removed.
CORE FORM 3 (131 Specimens)
This category is made up of core fragments and completely exhausted cores.
STEMMED FLAKES (2 Specimens; Fig. 18J-K): simple percussion spalls with chipped
stems~
The larger of the two seems to have a bifurcated stem resembling a crude Pedernales stem.
The other has a roughly rectangular stem with a small basal notch.
CHIPPED PEBBLES (4 Specimens)
These are thin limestone pebbles chipped on the end or on one or more edges. Use is
problematical.
HAMMERSTONES (12 Specimens; Fig. 18L-M): converted chert bifaces or cores.
These tools are presumed to have been used in the manufacture of chipped stone tools or
other hammering tasks.
UNMODIFIED FLAKES (16,011 Specimens)
This category includes all forms of flint flakes. Many of the flakes were possibly utilized but it
was impossible to determine whether the slight edge nibbling on some was intentional or caused
by accidental contact.
A thorough analysis of the flakes was not attempted. However, a cursory examination
revealed that the number of well worked unifacials from the site was noticeably low while the
number of large, potentially usable flakes was very high. This situation is in accord with the great
number of bifaces recovered from the site. Apparently in the Clear Fork to Round Rock Phases at
Greenhaw, the chipped stone industry placed a greater emphasis on the manufacture of bifacial
implements rather than unifacial tools.

MISCELLANEOUS STONE ARTIFACTS
All stone artifacts that were manufactured by means other than by chipping were placed in this class. Methods include pecking, grinding, and
smoothing.
SCORED ROCK (30 Specimens; Fig. 19A)
One specimen, from Midden C, is of black slate. Another specimen from Midden F is of red
hematite. The remaining 28 are of chert on which the softer cortex exhibits random but intentional scoring. The chert specimens consist of nodules, cores, cortex flakes, and choppers.
MANO FORM 1 (19 Specimens; Fig. 19B)
These specimens are of sandstone, granite, and quartzite stream pebbles that were completely or partially shaped by pecking and then grinding. All but one specimen have two grinding
surfaces. Four specimens exhibit minor abrasion facets at the edge of the primary grinding surfaces. Three specimens were pitted at the center of the main grinding surfaces: two by pecking;
one by first pecking and then smoothing of the peck marks, giving the surface a slight concavity.
MANO FORM 2 (17 Specimens; Fig. 19C):unaltered stream pebbles except for smoothed
and polished surfaces; usually one but sometimes two surfaces (not necessarily flat) polished.

In addition to possibly being used as grinding stones, Mano Form 2 specimens also may have
been used in hide tanning. The author witnessed (1960) stones exactly like these being used by
Cheyenne and Comanche Indians (Anadarko, Oklahoma) in the Indian tanning method. Using
this kind of stone, the tanning mixture was rubbed into the hides prior to softening.
MILLING SLABS (9 Specimens)
These specimens appear to be sections of milling stones with pecked and smoothed surfaces. One of the largest had a small circular depression (6.5 cm~ diameter) pecked into one
surface subsequent to breaking from the original slab.
UNCLASSIFIED GROUND STONE (I Specimen; Fig. 19D)
This specimen is a rectangular piece of hard sandstone with a small portion broken off one
end. It is somewhat flat, although a section through one side near the edge would appear hourglass shaped. Edges are sharp except at corners which are very bulbous and the thickest part of
the stone. This appearance was produced on all edges by biface bevel grinding that began at the
center of one edge and proceeded across the center of the stone to the other edge.
There is no indication of pecking. Minute grooves appear in the ground areas, which could
have been produced by the use of leather thongs. Dulling the edges of bifaces preparatory to
flaking could also produce such grooves. A similar specimen was found at the Cypress Creek site,
Hays County, Texas (University of Texas collection).
WACO SINKERS (3 Specimens; Fig. 19E-G)
One specimen is a hard, hematitic sandstone; others are quartzite. Specimens were notched
at both ends of their long axis, accomplished by pecking. The pecking completely encircles the
sandstone specimen.
This type of artifact was first described by Watt (1938) It has been suggested that these
artifacts, rather than being sinkers, were in fact bolas stones (T. N. Campbell, personal communication)~

BONE ARTIFACTS
BONE AWL (1 Specimen); deer (?) long bone splinter with one sharpened end.
CANINE TOOTH BEAD (1 Specimen; Fig. 18N) : small carnivore canine that has a groove
cut completely around the end of the root.
CUT BONE (2 Specimens)
One piece of deer long bone and one fragment of turtle shell have marks that appear to be
evidence of cutting as opposed to rodent gnawing.

UNMODIFIED ARTIFACT MATERIAL
Quartz, occuring as single small crystals or in crystal clusters, is found
weathering from the marly limestone formations on the lower slopes at the
site. It also occurs in all middens. In Midden B, a small concentration of eight
quartz crystal clusters were found in square N 110/W50 in Zone A-B. A single
crystal was found at the base of the skull of Burial 2.
Schist pebbles, an igneous stone, were recovered from Middens C and F
(one each). Because the geology of the site is sedimentary, the stones were
transported to the site. However, their use was undetermined.
Petrified wood is extremely rare in the Greenhaw vicinity. A single specimen, probably imported, was found at Midden C in Zone F.

FAUNAL MATERIAL
Bone was not well preserved anywhere in the site deposits. That which
could be identified was of deer, large fowl, and turtle. With the exception of
the small carnivore canine tooth, remains were almost exclusively deer at

Midden E. Examples of deer, fowl, and turtle were found at Midden C. Deer,
fowl, turtle, and racoon were found at Midden F. At Midden F, deer bone was
most abundant in Zones C, C-D, and D. Faunal material is completely absent
from Zone B.
Only four mussel shell valves were recovered from the entire site. One
value was found in Midden C, one in Midden E, and two in Midden F. Mussels are not found in the immediate vicinity of Cottonwood or Little Bear
creeks today.
Snail shells constitute the greatest body of faunal evidence. At certain
times, snails must have constituted an important part of the aboriginal subsistence, the most popular being Rabdotus (Bulimulus). Rabdotus concentrations were found in Middens C and E. A small size of Rabdotus was noted at
Midden D. Mature snails were not as large at the time this midden was being
accumulated as were those gathered when the other middens formed~ or the
aborigines were not gathering the mature specimens.
At Midden B, Robdotus was scarce while Helicina and Polygyra were
common. Those Rabdotus present are as large as those found in Middens C,
E, F, and G. In Midden E, Rabdotus was more common in Zone C than B. In
Midden F, Rabdodus was almost completely absent from Zone B.
Three specimens of the fresh water snail Helisoma were found in excavation, one at Midden E in Zone A-B and two at Midden F in Zone A.

POLLEN ANALYSIS
Twelve sediment samples were obtained from Greenhaw for pollen analysis: one from Midden B, five from Midden C, four from Midden F, and two
from the surface. Each sample was processed twice in the pollen laboratory of
the Botany Department of the University of Texas (Austin) under the direction of Dr. Donald Larson. Results were negative presumably because of the
nature of the sediment.
The sediment is extremely basic and has an unusually high count of fungal
spores. It is assumed that when the pollen grains reach the ground, they were
attacked almost immediately by fungi. Those not destroyed by fungus would
be destroyed by the basicity.

RADIOCARBON DATES
Four midden sediment samples were collected from Midden F. Midden F
produced mainly Pedernales points, considered to typify the Round Rock
Phase or Middle Archaic. Dates received were expected to be between 4000
and 3000 B.P. The time for the Round Rock Phase has since been revised to
4200 to 2600 B.P. (Weir, 1976).
Sediment samples were submitted to the Radiocarbon Laboratory,
Balcones Research Center, Universtiy of Texas (Austin). Radiocarbon dates
(Valastro et al., 1968:395-396)received are: 800 + 100 B.P. (A.D. 1150;
Tx-360), from square $160/W400 at the 0.5 to 1.0 ft level; 2850 + 90 B.P.
(900 B.C. ; Tx-451), from square $151/W420 at the 1.5 to 2.0 ft level; 2650

+ 80 B.P. (700 B.C. ; Tx-453), from square $151/W420 at the 1.5 to 2.0 ft
level; and 2900 + 100 B.P. (950 B.C.; Tx-463), from square $160/W400
at the 1.25 to 1.50 ft level.
By current estimates for the Round Rock Phase, Tx-360 is at least 1500
years too young. The probable explanation for this is the downward movement of modern charcoal, especially via deep cracks which form during dry
seasons. In recent times, brush and cedar stumps were burned in the area of
the site (and on Midden F), supplying a contamination source.
The other dates, from deeper in the midden, are slightly younger than
expected and possibly were affected by humic acid saturation. However,
expectations at the time of submission were based largely on speculation. The
wide discrepancy between Tx-360 and the other dates would not be due to
different pretreatment or variable degrees of humic acid contamination. Any
contamination was most likely by modern charcoal (Valastro et al.,
1968:396).
The older calculations show that dates can be arrived at from midden
sediments, but the degree of contamination can be expected to be higher than
in samples of hard carbon. The three dates are associated with materials that
are at least as old and possibly older than the dates.
At the Oblate site (Comal County, Texas), a comparable date of 3570 +
640 B.P. (1620 B.C. ~ Tamers et al., 1964:150) was obtained from charcoal
from a stratum containing Pedernales points. It is felt that this date is applicable to the Round Rock Phase or Middle Archaic (Collins, ms.). Although the
deviation for the Oblate site date is great, its highest limit overlaps the standard deviation of the oldest date from Midden F.
In another series of dates from Archaic materials at the La Jita site (Uvalde
County, Texas), Hester (1971) would possibly place the Round Rock Phase
around A.D. 100 for that area. At Arenosa Shelter (Amistad Reservoir), a
date of 4080 + 380 B.P. (2130 B.C.) was obtained from a zone bearing Val
Verde, Shumla-like, and Langtry dart points (Dibble, 1967:73). Johnson
(1964:96-97) placed these types in the Middle Archaic Period, paralleling the
Round Rock Phase in Central Texas.
The oldest three dates from Midden F are within two sigma variation.
Although the determinations are slightly younger than expected, they can be
considered useable dates with relation to the end of the Round Rock Phase in
Central Texas. The dates average 2,800 B.P. (850 B.C.). Johnson
(1967:39-40) calculates 2795 B.P. (845 B.C.) as the median date for Period
III which equates with the Middle Archaic, or Round Rock Phase.

CHRONOLOGY
An interesting characteristic of the site is its illustration of differential horizontal distribution of dart point types among middens of a single site. Most of
the evidence from Greenhaw comes from burned rock middens~ The artifact
assemblages from each midden appear to be dominated by dart point forms
singular to phases in the Archaic.
Jelks (1951) noted horizontal clustering of dart point types within burned
rock middens. However, it was not until later (Johnson et al., 1962) that the
time differences signified by the various Central Texas dart point types were

point types from each, and the not as distinct distribution of other lithic tools,
reflect temporal differences of the various occupations. Each occupation had
its own particular artifact assemblage. In the past, such a situation was inferred
(Suhm, 1959:245), but not supported by abundant evidence.
Midden B (Table 2) demonstrates the clearest stratigraphic separation of
cultural materials at the site. There were three zones. Dart point types such as
Travis (a Clear Fork type from the Early Archaic; Johnson et al., 1962:121)
occurred in the top zone. Dart points from the lower two zones are unclassified forms. The unclassified points undoubtably represent the San Geronimo
Phase, the earliest occupation at the site and one of the earliest periods in the
Archaic of Central Texas.
The distribution of artifact forms other than projectile points does not
seem significant. Biface Form 7 was not found at Midden B, but was found at
all other presumably later middens.
At Midden C (Table 3), the point types found indicate that it was predominantly occupied during the Clear Fork Phase. The preponderant type of dart
point is Bulverde, followed by Nolan, Travis, and Tortugas. Among the
minor types, only Provisional Type 1 had a definite distribution. Since it
occurred (other than as surface finds) only in the bottom zone in the southeast
quarter of the midden below the named types, it probably represents a San
Geronimo presence. The Pedernales varieties of the Round Rock Phase represent a minor, and one of the last, occupations of the midden.
Other artifacts found in Midden C include many biface forms. Biface
Forms I through 10 and 19 are dominant. Biface Forms 2, 11, 12 and 20 are

minor, found only at this predominantly Clear Fork midden. Non-projectile
point biface forms cannot definitely be attributed to the San Geronimo Phase
from this midden. Uniface Form 3 could possibly belong to the San Geronimo
Phase since it is found only at Middens B and C. Uniface Forms I and 6 are
found only at Midden C.
Little can be said about Midden D (Table 4). It may fall within the late Twin
Sisters Phase based on the single Frio dart point recovered from its shallow
sediment zone. However, a Frio-like form occurs in the San Geronimo
Phase. The biface forms found at Midden D are similar to those from Midden
C and the Uniface Forms were found at all middens.
Midden E (Table 5) is one of the most intact middens at Greenhaw. Four
zones were defined. Zone A underlies Zones B and C which are separated
horizontally rather than vertically. The primary artifacts of Zone A are
Bulverde (Variety II) and Travis dart points, Biface Form 2, and core residue.
Zone C is characterized by Bulverde (Variety II) and Travis dart points.
Bulverde (Variety II) is equally numerous as Travis.

With the exception of Zone D, which is mostly alluvium and recent humus, the midden accumulation is attributed to late in the Clear Fork Phase.
Biface and Uniface forms from Midden E are more like those from Midden C,
although the variety is not as great.
Dart points found in Midden F (Table 6) are Pedernales (Varieties I, II, III,
and Miscellaneous), Bulverde (Varieties I and II), and several minor types.
Pedernales is the preponderant period marker. The midden probably began
accumulating late in the Clear Fork Phase but accelerated with particularly
intensive occupations during the Round Rock Phase.
Other artifacts from the midden are a Waco sinker, stemmed flakes, biface
forms, unifaces, drills, and cores. Biface Form 3 is the most numerous; how~
ever, this form is common at all middens. Biface Forms 2, 7, 12, and 19 are
significant; Forms 17 and 18 are found only at this predominantly Round
Rock midden, although they are minor. Uniface Forms 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8 are
found, with Uniface Form 4 the most common.
In Midden G (Table 7), the Nolan dart point is the dominant type while
Pedernales is the next most numerous. Pedernales points were primarily
found in the upper zones while Nolan points were from the lower zone. From
the small testing of Midden G, it appears to span the transition from the Clear
Fork Phase to the Round Rock Phase, with occasional occupation in the San
Marcos Phase.
Tortugas, believed to belong to both the San Geronimo Phase and the
Clear Fork Phase (Weir, 1976), is a major type at Midden C. Elsewhere, it
occurred only in Midden B. Travis is a major point type in Middens C and E,
but found only in the upper zone at Midden B. Nolan is a major type at
Midden C, the dominant type at Midden G, and a minor type at Midden E.
Bulverde (Variety I) is the dominant type at Midden C and a minor type at
Middens E and F. Bulverde (Variety II) is dominant at Midden E and a minor

type in Middens C and F. The Round Rock dart point type, Pedernales, is the
preponderant type at Midden F, occurs as a minor type in Middens C and G,
and is insignificant at Midden E.
These distributions indicate the site was first occupied during the early San
Geronimo Phase in the vicinity of Middens B and C (Fig. 20). Major Clear
Fork Phase occupations followed at Middens C, E, and G. Round Rock
Phase occupations, primarily at Midden F, ensued. The San Marcos Phase is
represented by a few dart points at Middens C, D, F, and G. The Twin Sisters
Phase and Neo-American stage are insignificantly represented.

CONCLUSIONS
The site in part substantiates the chronological periods outlined by Johnson et al. (1962) and the Phases of Weir (1976). The apparent favorable
location induced intermittent occupations from earliest Archaic to probably
Neo-American times.
At Greenhaw, unclassified dart point forms and Provisional Type I were
found in the lower zones of Middens B and C, below zones containing Nolan,
Travis, and Bulverde types.
Johnson et al. (1962:121) characterized the earliest of four Archaic periods by dart point types Nolan, Travis, and Bulverde. Since then, evidence
now suggests that these types were preceded by an even earlier Archaic.
At Youngsport, Shafer (1963: 79) found the Gower type stratigraphically
below Bulverde and Nolan. At Landslide, basally notched forms and unclassified forms (Sorrow et al., 1967), some of which resemble Provisional Types
I and II, were found below Bulverde-like and Travis points. At the Millican
Bench site (Weir, ms.), notched points were found stratigraphically below
Travis.
At La Jita, Hester (1971) found evidence of an early corner notched type.
Solberger and Hester (1972) presented the concept of the archaic-like PreArchaic manifestation at the Strohacker site. Weir (ms.) described a small
assemblage from a site near the settlement of San Geronimo, Texas, as being
part of a component that was earlier than the Early Archaic of Johnson et al.
(1962). These artifacts were included in the San Geronimo Phase (Weir,
1976).

As yet, there are insufficient dates to indicate the earliest occurrence of the
Archaic period in Texas. Certainly, its beginning precedes the time of Clear
Fork Phase by at least 3000 years (Weir, 1976).
The first major occupations at Greenhaw, attributable to the Clear Fork
Phase, are represented by major Biface Forms 1-8, 10, 19 and minor Forms 9
and 11-15, all uniface forms, and Travis, Nolan, Bulverde, and Tortugas
point types. The Tortugas type possibly indicates an early Clear Fork affilia-

Weir- Greenhaw

57

tion with the Archaic cultures of the semi-arid regions of South Texas. The
Bulverde type is the dominant form for these early occupations at Middens C
and E.
The most intensive occupation represented at Greenhaw is at Midden F,
largest of the nine middens. Assemblages from Midden F are dominated by
Round Rock Phase artifacts, including Pedernales dart points, Biface Forms
2, 3, 7, 12, 16-18, 19, and 20, and Uniface Forms 4, 5, 6, and 7. Perforators
are present, with a near absence of gouges. In contrast, gouges are important
at Midden C. Stemmed flakes were found only at Midden F.
Midden G appears to span the times of the Clear Fork, Round Rock, and
San Marcos Phases. The Clear Fork Phase is best represented at this midden.
The accumulation of cultural debris at the Greenhaw site first began very
early in the Archaic during the San Geronimo Phase and continued well into
the Clear Fork Phase when Bulverde was favored. The final extensive occupation was during the Round Rock Phase when Pedernales found greatest
popularity. The Round Rock Phase produced the largest of the middens,
possibly demonstrating the most intense period of site utilization.
At Greenhaw, there is a coevality of certain point types as indicated by the
horizontal distribution within and between middens. It is possible that there
were differing groups of people inhabiting the region at the same time (overlapping territories), each with their own favored styles of artifacts and occupying the same campsites at different times. This situation may have occurred
during the Clear Fork Phase more than during the Round Rock Phase, as the
ratter is typified by one dart point type rather than several (Weir, 1976).
The types of artifacts found and similar accumulation of cultural debris
indicate that there was little difference in the subsistence pattern between
Clear Fork and Round Rock Phases. However, the larger sites and middens
during the Round Rock Phase, and proliferation of the Pedernales dart point
style and its associated assemblages, could be an indication of increased populations or an amalgamation of different groups inhabiting Central Texas
(Weir, 1976).

The midden stone technology is revealing in that the manufacture of
chipped stone tools emphasized the production of biface over uniface tools.
Morphological variations noted in tools from different middens at Greenhaw
are probably indicative of different culture occupations. However, tool functions were probably the same through time.
Burned rock middens were the scene of many activities: various forms of
cooking (possibly including stone boiling), manufacture of artifacts, burials.
Living areas would occasionally be cleaned; the camp rubble and detritus
collected and dumped down slope from the ledges. This activity resulted in
midden accumulations much like the cultural talus deposits found in front of
once occupied West Texas rock shelters.
The intra-midden mounding of stones noted in Midden B and Midden G
could be interpreted as being one-time dumpings of camp refuse. Sorrow
(1969:46) and Hester (1970, 1971) discussed the dump theory as the cause
for burned rock midden accumulation. Although important, dumping was
not the only factor (Hester, 1971:125-126).
A most important cause in midden accretion was the use of stone in
processing food plants, as evidenced by ring middens of West Texas. Collins
(1972) reported a midden at Devil’s Hollow (Travis County) which appeared
to be a ring midden (a massive accumulation of burned rock with an apparent
large central pit or depression). While most ring middens date after the Round
Rock Phase, the Travis County midden contained Bulverde-like dart points
which are normally associated with the Clear Fork Phase.
As with later West Texas ring middens, the midden at Devil’s Hollow
(Collins, 1972) and Midden E at Greenhaw may be very early examples of
plant food processing stations. This situation raises speculation as to the origin
of ring and crescent middens, commonly found in West Texas and throughout the Southwest. It could be that the function of middens which began
initially in Central Texas, spread westward and was perpetuated in the west
long after its importance had ceased in Central Texas.
A characteristic of ring middens, however, is that they usually contain few
artifacts and are found infrequently in an extensively utilized habitation area.
Conversely, Central Texas mounded middens seldom show evidence of
large food preparation pits (time and erosion may account for this), usually
contain a large assortment of artifacts, and are almost always associated with
areas of village activity. The associated habitation areas may account for the
high incidence of artifacts and chipping debris in the middens. However,
artifact free Zone B of Midden F leaves the question of function open.
Keller (1976) suggested that Central Texas midden peripheries served as
focal points for lithic manufacturing. As middens grew in size, midden aggregations would cover initial chipping stations and create new chipping foci
around the ever-expanding peripheries. However, burned rock middens
were not formed in neat leayers. They accumulate by mounding of midden
debris one pile on top of or next to another. The complexity of these cultural
accretions is compounded by cultural and non-cultural disturbances in the
accumulations.
The presence of dart points in Central Texas sites, especially in the middens, is the strongest indicator of the importance of hunting. If burned rock
midden were animal as well as processing stations, projectile points (still attached to dart foreshafts) encountered during butchering would be discarded

on the midden hearth. The dart points could possibly serve as supplementary
butchering tools (a secondary use).
The importance of hunting (probably deer and small animais) probably
fluctuated with changes in the dependence on collecting. Determinations of
subsistence percentages was, however, made impossible by the poor state of
preservation of organic remains. The evidence for collecting is apparent in the
presence of turtle remains, rare occurence of mussel shells, and the burned
rock middens themselves.
The Greenhaw site demonstrates that most middens are not alike. Each
midden investigated proved unique, with its own variation in size and content
and representing different time periods. Greenhaw should provide a key in
the interpretations of the Central Texas Archaic. The burned rock middens
indicate that during the Clear Fork and Round Rock Phases, economic strategies were significantly different than during antecedent or subsequent phases.
Exactly what the economic adaptations were during the Clear Fork and
Round Rock Phases is not entirely known. The key is in the burned rock
middens.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
This is a revised version of a master’s thesis titled "The Greenhaw Site: A Burned-Rock
Midden Cluster of the Edwards Plateau Aspect" (Weir, 1967). Neither the excavation of the
Greenhaw site nor the preparation of this report would have been possible without the courtesies
extended by the late John Greenhaw and the present land owners, Lonnie A. and Daphna
Farris. To them, I owe my wholehearted thanks. Also, special recognition is due those people
who offered their free time and labor in the excavation of the site: Ben R. Brown, Robert L.
Carlisle, John Clark, Michael B. Collins, John W. Greer, Lorraine Heartfield Green, Donny
Kolle, Roger and Val Nance, Ralph P. Mawyer Jr., Kent W. Mawyer, Claire Mawyer, Dianne
Morton, Mr. and Mrs. Bill Richmond, W. H. Sherer, Thad Sitton, and Gentry and Kay Steele.
To Leslie Von Rosenburg and, especially, Robert L. Carlisle, I would like to express my
thanks for their cooperation with my excavation procedures and for letting me have access to
their personal collections from the site. Advice and moral encouragement was provided by T. N.
Campbell, E. Mott Davis, Jeremiah F. Epstein, T. R. Hester, W. W. Newcomb, Dee Ann Story,
Michael B. Collins, Harry J. Shafer, Davis S. Dibble, and Curtis D. Tunnell.
An important job at any archeological site is mapping the area to be investigated. For an
excellent job at the Greenhaw site, I want to thank Preston Millican of the Lower Colorado River
Authority in Austin.
For cataloging and washing the artifacts, I would like to thank Donny Kolle, Frances Rosenberg Sorrow, and Ann Friedman. For analysis of the skeletal material, credit goes to Michael B.
Collins and Thomas S. Ellzey.
C. R. Thompson photographed the artifacts and R. Milton Bell aided in developing and
printing the plates of artifacts. Drafting was done by C. M. Landers and L. Wayne Belyeu.
Elizabeth L. Morris typed the manuscript.
And finally, whose patience and encouragement I could not have done without, I want to
thank my wife, Diane.
