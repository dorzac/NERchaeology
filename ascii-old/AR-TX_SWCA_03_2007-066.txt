ABSTRACT
Cultural resources investigations were conducted by SWCA Environmental Consultants
(SWCA) on behalf of TCB INC. and Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) for four
proposed bridge replacements in Frio County, Texas. The investigations were conducted under
Texas Antiquities Permit 4402. The cultural resources investigations were designed to identify
and evaluate any archaeological sites eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP) or that might warrant designation as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL).
The proposed undertaking entails the replacement and rehabilitation by TxDOT of four bridge
crossings that include: 1) two bridges along Peck-Bush Road at San Miguel Creek; 2) one bridge
along Applewhite Lane at Mustang Creek; and 3) one bridge along Andy Sadler Road at Live
Oak Creek. SWCA investigations included a background literature and records review and an
intensive pedestrian survey of the project area. All individual project locations were limited to
existing right-of-ways. The area of potential effects for the four bridge replacements typically
consists of 100 m along each approach with a typical vertical depth of 4 feet. Work near the
bridge crossings may entail cutting the banks at the crossing to a depth of 10 feet for a distance
of 25 feet from the existing edge of the banks.
The background literature and records review revealed that no archaeological sites have been
documented within or immediately adjacent to the bridge replacement project areas. Only the
Applewhite Lane at Mustang Creek crossing has any previously recorded sites (41FR25,
41FR40, and 41FR44) within 1.5 miles of the project area. The current proposed project will not
impact any of the previously recorded sites.
SWCA’s intensive survey did not encounter any evidence of cultural materials on the surface or
subsurface at any of the three project areas. Therefore, no cultural resources will be affected by
the proposed projects. Additionally, a visual inspection was conducted for the portions extending
beyond 25 feet beyond the ROW along both sides of the road in each of the project areas. Aside
from an isolated flake and a few possible burned rocks outside the Peck-Bush Road at San Mi­
guel Creek APE, no cultural materials were observed.
In accordance with 36 CRF 800.4, SWCA has made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify
archeological historic properties within the APE of the proposed undertaking. The proposed re­
placement of the four bridges in Frio County will impact previously disturbed areas with no sig­
nificant cultural properties. Thus, the proposed project will not affect any cultural resources. As
no properties were identified that meet the criteria for listing in the NRHP according to 36 CFR
60.4 or for designation as an SAL according to 13 TAC 26.12, SWCA recommends no further
archaeological investigations for these project areas.
No artifacts were collected. Therefore, nothing was curated.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
PROJECT TITLE: Cultural Resources Survey of Four Frio County Bridges, Frio County, Texas.
SWCA PROJECT NUMBER: 12178-143.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The project included a background literature and records review for
previously conducted cultural resources surveys and recorded sites and an intensive pedestrian
survey augmented with shovel testing and trenching for the proposed replacement of four rural
Frio County bridges.
LOCATION: The project is comprised of four bridge replacement at three project area locations
in Frio County. One project area encompasses the two bridges on Peck-Bush Road at the San
Miguel Creek crossings located about 5 miles northwest of the intersection of Farm-to-Market
(FM) 140 and FM 472 in eastern Frio County. The Applewhite Lane at Mustang Creek project
area is located roughly 1 mile north of the intersection of FM 1582 and County Road (CR) 3871
in southeastern Frio County. The Andy Sadler Road at Live Oak Creek project area is located
about 4 miles east of Bigfoot, Texas, near the intersection of CR 2872 and State Highway 173 in
northeastern Frio County. These project areas appear on the Shattel NW, Hindes, and Bigfoot
7.5-minute topographic quadrangle maps, respectively.
NUMBER OF ACRES SURVEYED: A total of approximately 3 acres.
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Kevin A. Miller.
TEXAS ANTIQUITIES PERMIT: 4402.
DATES OF WORK: February 1–2 and 7–8, 2007.
PURPOSE OF WORK: Since the construction would involve federal funds from the Federal
Highway Administration and state land controlled by the San Antonio District of TxDOT, inves­
tigations were conducted in compliance with the Texas Antiquities Code; the National Historic
Preservation Act; the First Amended Programmatic Agreement among the FHWA, TxDOT, the
Texas State Historic Preservation Officer, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation
regarding the implementation of transportation undertakings, and the Memorandum of Under­
standing between TxDOT and the Texas Historical Commission.
NUMBER OF SITES: None.
CURATION: No artifacts were observed. Thus, nothing was curated.
COMMENTS: The pedestrian survey utilized shovel testing and trenching in the relatively undis­
turbed locations of the project areas. No cultural materials were observed on the surface or in the
subsurface investigations of the three project areas. Therefore, SWCA recommends that no fur­
ther archaeological investigations.

INTRODUCTION
On behalf of TCB INC. and the Texas De­
partment of Transportation (TxDOT),
SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA)
conducted an intensive cultural resources
survey of four proposed bridge replacements
within three project areas in Frio County,
Texas (Figure 1). Two of the bridges are lo­
cated on Peck-Bush Road at San Miguel
Creek, within 0.1 mile of each other. The
proposed undertaking entails the replace­
ment and rehabilitation of all these bridges
by TxDOT. Since the construction would
involve federal funds from the Federal High­
way Administration (FHWA) and state land
controlled by the San Antonio District of
TxDOT, investigations were conducted in
compliance with the Texas Antiquities
Code; the National Historic Preservation
Act; the First Amended Programmatic
Agreement among the FHWA, TxDOT, the
Texas State Historic Preservation Officer,
and the Advisory Council on Historic Pres­
ervation regarding the implementation of
transportation undertakings, and the Memo­
randum of Understanding between TxDOT
and the Texas Historical Commission
(THC). The THC issued Antiquities Permit
4402 to SWCA to conduct the cultural re­
source investigations with Kevin A. Miller
serving as the Principal Investigator.

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The proposed undertaking entails the re­
placement and rehabilitation of bridges by
TxDOT on various roads in Frio County,
Texas. The four bridge crossings include: 1)
two bridges along Peck-Bush Road at San
Miguel Creek; 2) one bridge along Applewhite Lane at Mustang Creek; and 3) one
bridge along Andy Sadler Road at Live Oak
Creek.
Although some individual project construc­
tion areas may be limited to a single ap­
proach, the APE for the bridge replacement
undertakings will consist of the existing
right-of-ways (ROWs) of the bridges and
their approaches for a distance 100 meters
along each approach. All individual project
areas are limited to existing ROWs. How­
ever, SWCA will also visually inspect from
the ROW an additional 25-foot wide corri­
dor parallel to the ROWs to evaluate and
address the potential for adjacent buried
and/or significant archeological deposits.
All work was conducted on lands owned or
controlled by TxDOT.

The purpose of the work was to locate all
prehistoric and historic archaeological sites
in the area of potential effects (APE), estab­
lish vertical and horizontal site boundaries
as appropriate with regard to the APE, and
evaluate the significance and integrity of any
sites recorded in the APE for eligibility for
listing in the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP) or designation as a State Ar­
cheological Landmark (SAL). All work was
done in accordance with the standards and
guidelines of the Antiquities Code of Texas
and the National Historic Preservation Act.

The vertical depth of impacts has not been
specified in detail. However, construction
within typical roadway approaches does not
impact deposits at depths greater than 4 feet.
In addition, work for any required bridge
crossings may entail cutting the banks at the
crossing to a depth of 10 feet for a distance
of 25 feet from the existing edge of the
banks.
The bridges at the San Miguel Creek cross­
ing are located about 5 miles northwest of
the intersection of Farm-to-Market (FM)

stone of the Queen City Sand Formation
(Barnes 1983). The soils at the crossing are
mapped as occasionally flooded Poteet very
fine sandy loam and Miguel very fine sandy
loam (1–3 percent slopes), which is charac­
terized as very deep, loamy soils that occupy
broad, smooth plains (Gabriel et al. 1992).

140 and FM 472, just north of the intersec­
tion of Sadler Road and Peck-Bush Road
(Figure 2). The two bridges are located just
downstream of a divergence of the San Mi­
guel Creek, which is a moderate size tribu­
tary of the Frio River. The geology of the
two creek crossings is mapped as Quater­
nary-period Alluvium. The alluvial flood­
plain and low terrace deposits consist of
gravel, sand, clay, silt and organic material
(Barnes 1976). The soils along San Miguel
Creek are mapped as Divot soils that are
frequently and occasionally flooded (Gabriel
et al. 1992). These soils are described as
very deep, loamy soils occupying flood
plains along rivers and large creeks with an
undulating surface due to braided channels
and sloughs (Gabriel et al. 1992).

METHODS
BACKGROUND REVIEW
SWCA conducted a thorough archaeological
literature and records search of the three
project areas. An SWCA archaeologist
searched site files and maps at the Texas Ar­
cheological Research Laboratory and the
THC’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas, an
online database, for any previously recorded
surveys and historic or prehistoric archaeo­
logical sites located in or near the project
areas. In addition to identifying previously
recorded archaeological sites, the Atlas re­
view included the following types of infor­
mation: NRHP properties, SALs, Official
Texas Historical Markers (OTHMs), Regis­
tered Texas Historic Land Marks (RTHLs),
cemeteries, and local neighborhood surveys.

The project area for the Applewhite Lane at
Mustang Creek is located roughly 1 mile
north of the intersection of FM 1582 and
County Road (CR) 3871 (Figure 3). The
project area is situated on Mustang Creek, a
small upland drainage that drains into San
Miguel Creek before reaching the Frio
River. The geology of the crossing is
mapped as Eocene age clay and sandstone of
the Cook Mountain Formation (Barnes
1976). The soils of the crossing are mapped
as occasionally flooded Poteet very fine
sandy loam, which are described as very
deep, loamy soils found along narrow up­
land drainage ways, and Amphion sandy
clay loam (0–1 percent slopes), which are
characterized as very deep, loamy soils that
occupy broad plains (Gabriel et al. 1992).

FIELD METHODS
Each archaeological field survey of the four
proposed bridge replacement locations con­
sisted of two SWCA archaeologists walking
the entire proposed project areas to deter­
mine the nature, extent, and, if possible, po­
tential significance of any cultural resources
located within the APE. During the surveys,
the archaeologists examined the ground sur­
face and erosional profiles for cultural re­
sources. The primary means of subsurface
investigations consisted of shovel testing.
However, where deposition exceeded the
limits of shovel test excavations, particularly
in regards to San Miguel Creek, backhoe

The final project area, Andy Sadler Road at
Live Oak Creek, is located about 4 miles
east of Bigfoot, Texas, near the intersection
of CR 2872 and State Highway 173 (Figure
4). The project area is situated on Live Oak
Creek, a small upland drainage that empties
into Sestedero Creek, a tributary of the
Atascosa River. The geology of the crossing

trench by an experienced archaeologist. All
work was performed in accordance with
OSHA standards (29 CFR Part 1926) and
the Texas Trench Safety Act (H. B. 1569)
and the entire process was thoroughly pho­
tographed. All trenches were backfilled and
leveled upon completion of excavation and
recording.

trenching was utilized. The intensive subsur­
face investigations were limited to relatively
undisturbed areas with disturbed portions of
the project areas examined at a reconnais­
sance level only.
The THC’s minimum survey standards for
0–2 acre projects are 3 shovel tests per acre.
Thus, the Applewhite Lane at Mustang
Creek project area (approx. 1–acre) and the
Andy Sadler Road at Live Oak Creek pro­
ject area (approx. 1–acre) required 3 shovel
tests at each location. While the Peck-Bush
Road at San Miguel Creek project area re­
quired 6 shovel tests. However, due to dis­
turbances and upland topography, fewer
shovel tests were utilized at the Mustang
Creek (one shovel test) and the Live Oak
Creek project areas (one shovel test). Due
to depositional soils at the San Miguel Creek
project area, four shovel tests and five back­
hoe trenches were utilized.

In addition to the subsurface investigations,
the archaeological crew photographed the
environment and disturbances during the
survey of the project area. Also, all available
exposures were examined for the presence
of cultural materials.

RESULTS
BACKGROUND REVIEW
The background review and environmental
literature search of the project APE deter­
mined that none of the project areas have
been surveyed for archaeological resources
nor are there any cultural resources docu­
mented within or adjacent to the project ar­
eas. In addition, there are no NRHP proper­
ties, SALs, OTHMs, RTHLs, cemeteries, or
local neighborhood surveys within one mile
of the project areas. Only the Applewhite
Lane at Mustang Creek crossing has any
previously recorded archaeological sites
within 1.5 miles of the project area; previ­
ously recorded sites (41FR25, 41FR40, and
41FR44) are located within 1.5 miles of the
crossing. No information was available for
41FR25, which is located roughly 1.5 miles
northeast of the crossing.

All shovel tests were excavated until bed­
rock or a substratum believed to predate
human occupation was encountered. Exca­
vated soil was screened through ¼-inch
mesh to retrieve any cultural materials that
might be present. Each test performed
through the course of the survey was docu­
mented with standardized shovel test forms
and recorded with a handheld GPS, which
were subsequently plotted on a map of the
project areas.
The backhoe trenches were excavated to a
depth sufficient to determine the pres­
ence/absence of buried cultural materials
and allow the complete recording of all
geomorphic information to depths of project
impacts. Generally, the trenches were ap­
proximately 1.5 m deep, 6 m in length, and
1.5 m wide. All trenching was monitored by
an experienced archaeologist while excava­
tions were underway. Stratigraphic profile
soil descriptions were recorded for each

The nearest archaeological site (41FR40) is
1.0 miles northeast of the Applewhite Lane
at Mustang Creek project area. Site 41FR40
was recorded in 2001 as an unknown prehis­
toric campsite possibly exhibiting several
components of occupation on the first ter­
race above Mustang Creek. The site con­

tains a random scatter of burned rock and
lithic debitage exhibiting early to late stage
reduction. Cores, scraping tools, and bifa­
cial fragments were also observed. The arti­
fact assemblage was identified as eroding
from a road cut about 19 inches (48 cm) be­
low surface. No temporally diagnostic arti­
facts were observed on the site, no formal
recommendations for further work were
made, and its eligibility status has not been
clearly determined (Atlas, 41FR40 site
form).

PECK-BUSH ROAD AT SAN MIGUEL CREEK
The project area encompasses two bridges
located along Peck-Brush Road at a diver­
gence of San Miguel Creek. The two cross­
ings are approximately 0.1 mile apart and
are located just north of the intersection of
Sadler Road (CR 2500) and Peck-Bush
Road (see Figure 2). The project area en­
compasses approximately 2 acres of existing
80 feet wide ROW that includes the road
and the two bridges.

The next closest archaeological site
(41FR44) is 1.3 miles east of the Applewhite
Lane and Mustang Creek project area. Site
41FR44 was recorded in 2001 as an un­
known prehistoric campsite eroding from a
small upland gully. The site contains a
spare amount of diffusely scattered lithic
debitage with no predominant stage of lithic
reduction recorded. No temporally diagnos­
tic artifacts were observed on the site and no
formal recommendations for further work
were made, and its eligibility status has not
been clearly determined (Atlas, 41FR44 site
form).

The project area is situated in a gently roll­
ing upland while the San Miguel Creek is a
minor upland drainage. The project area is
predominately cleared ROW with main­
tained short grasses surrounded by scattered
timber (e.g., mesquite, oaks, and elms) just
outside the ROW, while the drainage has a
riparian corridor with various mixed hard­
woods (e.g., elms and oaks). Surface visi­
bility was good, typically 40–60 percent.

FIELD SURVEY
The survey of the four proposed bridge
crossing replacements in Frio County, Texas
determined that the majority of the project
areas are located in upland settings that have
been severely disturbed. Aside from the two
bridge crossings at San Miguel Creek, the
project areas were investigated with minimal
shovel testing. Alternatively, the soils at the
Peck-Bush Road at San Miguel Creek pro­
ject area exceeded the limits of shovel tests
resulting in the utilization of backhoe
trenches to fully assess the potential to con­
tain intact buried cultural materials.

Each of the existing bridges consist of a sin­
gle span concrete beam approximately 40
feet long and 15 feet wide and supported by
concrete abutments at the drainage banks
(Figure 5). The Peck-Bush roadway runs
north to south and consists of a 20-feet wide
graded road with no shoulders. The San Mi­
guel Creek drainages, at these crossings,
trends northwest to southeast and exhibits 4­
foot high cutbanks. At the time of this
evaluation, the drainage contained isolated
areas of standing water at low points condu­
cive to intermittent flow.

Two SWCA archaeologists conducted the
intensive pedestrian survey of the bridge

4/3) clay loam. The southern trenches (BHT
1 and 5) had an extremely firm dark yellow­
ish brown (10YR 4/4) clay loam under the
darker clay loam. This lower stratum be­
came shallower with increased distance
away from the southern San Miguel Creek
drainage. The color of this deeper stratum is
similar to the surficial soils away from the
project area and the soils on the graded road
(Figure 9). No cultural material was ob­
served in any of the subsurface investiga­
tions. In addition, the entire project area
was examined and all available cut bank ex­
posures were inspected with no cultural ma­
terials observed.

Disturbances to the project area include road
grading and buried utilities. The road grad­
ing has imported chert and limestone gravels
from areas south and north of the project
area in more upland environments with ex­
posed bedrock gravels. These areas contain
abundant surficial gravels and cobbles not
observed near the San Miguel Creek cross­
ings. The lack of gravels within the project
area is apparent in the trench and shovel test
profiles excavated adjacent to the roadway.
These profiles revealed a thin layer of dis­
turbed road overburden consisting of the
above mentioned gravels over alternating
clay loam soils with minimal inclusions
(Table 1).

A visual inspection of private lands up to 25
feet outside of the existing ROW was also
conducted. All areas surrounding the cross­
ing appear to be minimally disturbed and
otherwise intact. Just beyond the eastern
ROW near the southern creek crossing, one
flake and a few possible burned rock frag­
ments appeared to be eroding from the creek
bank. The area within the ROW adjacent to
the cultural material was intensively in­
spected with no evidence of cultural materi­
als being observed within the ROW.

The utilities within the project area include a
buried communication line adjacent to the
western ROW boundary running parallel
with the roadway along the entire project
area (Figure 6). An additional buried utility
was unmarked and discovered in BHT 3
(Figure 7). The utility is located adjacent to
the eastern ROW boundary running parallel
to the roadway from the northern extent of
the project area to just north of the southern
creek crossing. From that point, the line ap­
pears to change direction to run perpendicu­
lar to the roadway in an unknown direction.
The line, however, does not continue along
the eastern ROW, south of the southern
creek crossing.

APPLEWHITE LANE AT MUSTANG CREEK
The Applewhite Lane at Mustang Creek pro­
ject area is situated in a disturbed upland
setting with little deposition. The project
area encompasses approximately one acre
which includes the road and bridge within a
narrow ROW (i.e., 50 feet). The ROW
within the project area is overgrown with
grasses surrounded by scattered mesquite,
oaks, and elms that extend beyond the ROW
(Figure 10). Surface visibility was moder­
ate, typically 20–40 percent.

Subsurface investigations within the PeckBush Road at San Miguel Creek project area
included five backhoe trenches and four
shovel tests (Figure 8).
The backhoe
trenches revealed a disturbed layer extend­
ing up to 44 cm below surface. This dis­
turbed layer consists of the previously dis­
cussed road gravels and asphalt, as well as
modern debris mixed within soils similar to
the underlying matrix. The underlying ma­
trix is a very dark brown (10YR 2/2) friable
sandy clay loam over a firm brown (10YR

ing upland topography. The drainage at the

crossing displays 3–4-foot high slightly in­
cised cutbanks. At the time of evaluation,
the drainage did not have any water flowing
suggesting intermittent flow. The northern
bridge approach is cut below grade from 1–3
feet and the southern approach is cut below
grade from 1–2 feet, leveling the undulating
area. The bridge itself consists of steel girder
I-beams with a steel plating deck supported
by a concrete beam (Figure 11). The road
along the approaches of the bridge is com­
prised of gravel and dirt that has been inten­
sively bladed.

ANDY SADLER ROAD AT LIVE OAK CREEK
The Andy Sadler at Live Oak Creek project
area is similar to the Applewhite Lane at
Mustang Creek project area in that it is situ­
ated in a disturbed upland setting with little
deposition. The pedestrian survey encoun­
tered a very narrow ROW (i.e., 50 feet) that
has been disturbed from various construc­
tion activities and utilities. The project area
encompasses approximately 1 acre which
includes the road and bridge. The ROW
within the project area covered by main­
tained grasses surrounded by scattered mes­
quite, oaks, and elms that extend beyond the
ROW. Surface visibility was adequate,
typically 40–60 percent.

The majority of the project area exhibited
severe disturbances including a buried utility
and road construction activities. The buried
utility consists of a telephone cable running
along the western portion of the ROW, par­
alleling Applewhite Lane. The road con­
struction disturbances include a shallow
drainage ditch running adjacent to the buried
utility, parallel to the road before veering out
of the ROW, north of the creek. The other
road related disturbances include the above
mentioned road cuts and grading.

Live Oak Creek is a minor upland drainage
that flows north/northeast into Siestedero
Creek before draining into the Atascosa
River. The drainage at the crossing displays
4-foot high cutbanks and, at the time of
evaluation, the drainage did not have any
water flowing suggesting intermittent flow.
The western bridge approach is cut below
grade from 1–3 feet. The bridge itself con­
sists of steel girder with a steel plating deck
and a steel truss frame supported by two sets
of concrete pillars (Figure 13). The road
along the approaches of the bridge is com­
prised of gravel and dirt that has been inten­
sively bladed.

Due to the high amount of disturbances in
the narrow APE, only one shovel test was
excavated (Figure 12, Table 2). The shovel
test (AW-1) revealed a disturbed silty loam
layer over a slightly mottled dark brown
(7.5YR 3/3) silty loam to 70 cm below sur­
face. These soils sat atop a brown (7.5YR
4/2) basal clay loam. No cultural material
was encountered. In addition, the entire pro­
ject area was examined and all available cut
bank exposures were inspected with no cul­
tural materials observed.

The project area at Live Oak Creek exhib­
ited severe disturbances including a buried
utility and road construction activities. The
buried utility consists of a water line marked
along the northern portion of the ROW, west
of the creek. Although the exact orientation
of the waterline is unknown, it likely paral­
lels the road. The ROW south of the road
and west of the creek exhibited severe dis­

A visual inspection of private lands up to 25
feet outside of the existing ROW was also
conducted. All areas surrounding the cross­
ing appear to be generally intact with mini­
mal disturbances consisting of vegetation
clearing along fence lines. No cultural mate­

turbances likely from grading or bulldozing
activities associated with the roadway. The
ROW east of the creek is extremely narrow
with a maximum of 4 feet between the ROW
boundary and the graded road edge. Other
road related disturbances include the above
mentioned road cuts and grading. The
amount of disturbance accompanied with the
shallow soils in the area did not lend itself to
extensive subsurface investigations.

(FHWA) and state land controlled by the
San Antonio District of TxDOT, investiga­
tions were conducted in compliance with the
Texas Antiquities Code; the National His­
toric Preservation Act; the First Amended
Programmatic Agreement among the
FHWA, TxDOT, the Texas State Historic
Preservation Officer, and the Advisory
Council on Historic Preservation regarding
the implementation of transportation under­
takings, and the Memorandum of Under­
standing between TxDOT and the THC. The
THC issued Antiquities Permit 4402 to
SWCA to conduct the cultural resource in­
vestigations with Kevin A. Miller serving as
the Principal Investigator.

Due to the high amount of disturbances and
the narrow APE, only one shovel test was
excavated (Figure 14, Table 3). The shovel
test (AS-1) revealed a dark brown (7.5YR
3/2) sandy loam layer over a brown (7.5YR
5/4) sandy loam to 70 cm below surface.
These soils sat atop a brown (7.5YR 4/2)
basal clay loam mottled with yellowish red
(5YR 4/6) clays. No cultural material was
encountered in the shovel test. In addition,
the entire project area was examined and all
available cut bank exposures were inspected
with no cultural materials observed.

The background literature and records review
revealed that no archaeological sites have
been documented within or immediately ad­
jacent to the bridge replacement project ar­
eas. Only the Applewhite Lane at Mustang
Creek crossing has any previously recorded
sites (41FR25, 41FR40, and 41FR44) within
1.5 miles of the project area. No informa­
tion could be found on site 41FR25 and no
temporally diagnostic artifacts were ob­
served on sites 41FR40 or 41FR44, and no
formal recommendations for further work or
eligibility status were clearly determined
(Atlas, 41FR40 and 41FR44 site form).
However, the current proposed undertaking
will not impact any of the previously re­
corded sites.

A visual inspection of private lands up to 25
feet outside of the existing ROW was also
conducted. All areas surrounding the cross­
ing appear to be generally intact with mini­
mal disturbances consisting of vegetation
clearing along fence lines. No cultural mate­
rial was observed in these areas outside the
ROW.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The survey of the Peck-Bush Road at San
Miguel Creek project area encountered de­
positional soils in an area that has been ex­
tensively disturbed by underground utilities
and road related construction activities. The
survey of the Applewhite Lane at Mustang
Creek project area and the project area along
Andy Sadler Road at Live Oak Creek en­
countered extensively disturbed, narrow
ROW crossings of the upland drainages.
Evidence of significant disturbances was

observed at both project areas primarily as­
sociated with the construction of the respec­
tive roadways and various utilities.
Due to the presence of depositional soils in
the Peck-Bush Road at San Miguel Creek
project area, a total of four shovel tests and
five backhoe trenches were conducted
within the undisturbed portions of the ROW.
At the Applewhite Lane at Mustang Creek
and the Andy Sadler Road at Live Oak
Creek project areas, only one shovel test ex­
cavation was conducted at each location due
the narrow width of the ROW corridor and
the amount of disturbances. SWCA’s inten­
sive survey did not encounter any evidence
of cultural materials on the surface or sub­
surface at any of the three project areas.
Therefore, no cultural resources will be af­
fected by the proposed projects. Addition­
ally, a visual inspection was conducted for
the portions extending beyond 25 feet be­
yond the ROW along both sides of the road
in each of the project areas. Aside from an
isolated flake and a few possible burned
rocks outside the Peck-Bush Road at San
Miguel Creek APE, no cultural materials
were observed. However, should construc­
tion activities extend beyond the fence lines
in either project area, then further investiga­
tions are recommended. Due to the high
probability nature of the undisturbed river
terraces observed at the Peck-Bush Road at
San Miguel Creek crossing, any further in­
vestigations should be conducted with back­
hoe trench excavations.
In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, SWCA
has made a reasonable and good faith effort
to identify archeological historic properties
within the APE. As no properties were iden­
tified that meet the criteria for listing in the
NRHP according to 36 CFR 60.4 or for des­
ignation as a SAL according to 13 TAC
26.12, SWCA recommends no further work.
