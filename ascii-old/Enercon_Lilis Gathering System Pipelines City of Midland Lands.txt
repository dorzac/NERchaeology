ABSTRACT
Enercon Services, Inc. (ENERCON), in support of Salt Creek Midstream, LLC, conducted an intensive
cultural resources investigation for the proposed Lilis Gathering System Pipelines located near Kermit, in
Winkler County, Texas. The proposed Lilis Gathering System Pipelines consist of three lateral pipelines
extending from the existing Salt Creek Midstream, LLC Bunker Hill (North Trunk) Pipeline. The three
lateral pipelines total 10.16 miles (16.53 km) in length. This report encompasses only the two pipelines of
the proposed Lilis Gathering System on City of Midland lands. The City of Midland is a political
subdivision of the State of Texas. The two Lilis Gathering System Pipelines on City of Midland lands total
approximately 7.80 miles (12.55 km) in length and are depicted on the United States Geological Survey
(USGS) Cheyenne Draw, Tex. (1970) 7.5 Minute Quadrangle. The construction corridor consists of a 50
foot (15 m) wide permanent pipeline right-of-way (ROW) and an additional 50 foot (15 m) wide temporary
workspace corridor. The cultural resources survey area-of-potential-effect (APE) on City of Midland lands
consists of the 7.80 mi (12.55 km) by 100 foot (30 m) corridor, totaling 94.55 acres (38.26 hectares).
The cultural resources survey and report are intended to assist in adhering to the 1969 Antiquities Code of
Texas and the survey of the City of Midland lands was completed under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 9015.
The entire project was supervised by Gary D. Edington, an ENERCON archeologist who meets the U.S.
Secretary of the Interior’s Professional Qualification Standards for archeology as set forth in 36 CFR 61.
Prior to the survey, a search of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (the Atlas) was conducted by Michael
M. Margolis to locate previously recorded archeological sites, archeological surveys, National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) properties, and State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). Based on the Atlas, no sites
have been previously recorded within 1-mile of the APE on City of Midland lands and no archeological
surveys or studies are mapped within 1-mile of the APE on City of Midland lands. The survey on City of
Midland lands was conducted October 2 and 10-12, 2018 by Christopher Flowers and Gary D. Edington.
Fieldwork was conducted in accordance with the Texas Historical Commission (THC) Archeological
Survey Standards for Texas.
The cultural resources survey resulted in the recording of one new archeological site, 41WK137, and the
observation of one isolated find, IF#1. Site 41WK137 is a scatter of domestic household debris and the
stem wall and foundation of a detached garage, dating to the mid-20th century. The house has been razed
by bulldozing resulting in a light scatter of domestic trash and structural debris. An Aermotor Chicago
windmill and a large water tank are located east of the APE. 41WK137 lacks further information potential
and no further work is recommended at the site. Due to the lack of information potential, site 41WK137 is
recommended not eligible for listing on the NRHP or designation as a SAL. IF#1 consisted of a single
tertiary flake of white chert observed on the ground surface. An intensive pedestrian grid at 3-5 m intervals,
and five shovel tests placed in the vicinity of IF#1 failed to reveal additional cultural materials. IF#1 lacks
additional information potential and is therefore not eligible for listing on the NRHP or designation as a
SAL.
The cultural resources survey of the Lilis Gathering System Pipelines APE did not result in finding any
additional prehistoric or historic artifacts, features, cultural lenses, or sites and no artifacts were collected
on City of Midland lands. Therefore, it is recommended that construction of the proposed Lilis Gathering
System Pipelines on City of Midland lands will have no effect on any historic property that may qualify for
inclusion on the NRHP or SAL listings. No further cultural resources investigations are recommended prior
to construction of the Lilis Gathering System Pipelines on City of Midland lands. If cultural material,
including sites, features, or artifacts that are 50 years old or older are encountered within the ROW on City
of Midland lands during construction of Lilis Gathering System Pipelines, work in the area must cease and
the regional THC Archeologist must be notified immediately.

INTRODUCTION

Enercon Services, Inc. (ENERCON), in support of Salt Creek Midstream, LLC, conducted an intensive
cultural resources investigation for the proposed Lilis Gathering System Pipelines located near Kermit, in
Winkler County, Texas (Figure 1). The proposed Lilis Gathering System Pipelines consists of three lateral
pipelines extending from the existing Salt Creek Midstream, LLC Bunker Hill (North Trunk) Pipeline. The
three lateral pipelines total 10.16 miles (16.53 km) in length. This report encompasses only the two pipelines
of the proposed Lilis Gathering System on City of Midland lands. The City of Midland is a political
subdivision of the State of Texas. The two Lilis Gathering System Pipelines on City of Midland lands total
approximately 7.80 miles (12.55 km) in length and are depicted on the United States Geological Survey
(USGS) Cheyenne Draw, Tex. (1970) 7.5 Minute Quadrangle (Figures 2.1 and 2.2). The construction
corridor consists of a 50 feet (15 m) wide permanent pipeline right-of-way (ROW) and an additional 50
feet (15 m) wide temporary workspace corridor. The cultural resources survey area-of-potential-effect
(APE) on City of Midland lands consists of the 7.80 mi (12.55 km) by 100 feet (30 m) corridor, totaling
94.55 acres (38.26 hectares).
Construction of the Lilis Gathering System Pipeline will involve the mechanized clearing of vegetation
within the APE and open-cut trenching where the pipeline will be buried. Clearing of vegetation is typically
done with bulldozers. The trenches are typically at least four to six feet (1.2 to 1.8 m) deep and three to four
feet (0.9 to 1.2 m) wide and dug by excavators. Interstate, State, County, and private lease roads are typically
bored under by horizonal directional drilling. Additional impacts within the APE include foot traffic and
general vehicle traffic ranging from light-duty pickup trucks to heavy mechanized equipment. Once
construction is complete and the pipeline is operational, all trenches and pits will be backfilled and all
construction equipment will be removed.
The cultural resources survey and report are intended to assist in adhering to the 1969 Antiquities Code of
Texas and the survey of the City of Midland lands was completed under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 9015.
The entire project was supervised by Gary D. Edington, an ENERCON archeologist who meets the U.S.
Secretary of the Interior’s Professional Qualification Standards for archeology as set forth in 36 CFR 61.
No artifacts were collected during the survey. Pursuant to 13 TAC 26.17, notes, records, photographs, and
photograph logs generated during the field investigations have been prepared for permanent curation at the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas.
Prior to the cultural resources survey, a search of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (the Atlas) was
conducted by Michael M. Margolis to locate previously recorded archeological sites, archeological surveys,
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) properties, and State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). Based
on the Atlas, no sites have been previously recorded within 1-mile of the APE on City of Midland lands
and no archeological surveys or studies are mapped within 1-mile of the APE on City of Midland lands.
The cultural resources survey on City of Midland lands was conducted October 2 and 10-12, 2018 by
Christopher Flowers and Gary D. Edington. Fieldwork was conducted in accordance with the Texas
Historical Commission (THC) Archeological Survey Standards for Texas.

or designation as a SAL.
The cultural resources survey of the Lilis Gathering System Pipelines APE did not result in finding any
additional prehistoric or historic artifacts, features, cultural lenses, or sites on City of Midland lands.
Therefore, it is recommended that construction of the proposed Lilis Gathering System Pipelines on City
of Midland lands will have no effect on any historic property that may qualify for inclusion on the NRHP
or SAL listings. No further cultural resources investigations are recommended prior to construction of the
Lilis Gathering System Pipelines on City of Midland lands. If cultural material, including sites, features, or
artifacts that are 50 years old or older are encountered within the ROW on City of Midland lands during
construction of Lilis Gathering System Pipelines, work in the area must cease and the regional THC
Archeologist must be notified immediately.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

The APE is situated within the Chihuahuan Basin and Playas biotic province of the Chihuahuan Deserts
ecoregion (Griffith et al. 2007). The Chihuahuan Basins and Playas are part of the larger Chihuahuan
Deserts which extend from the Madrean Archipelago of Arizona in the west to the Edwards Plateau of westcentral Texas. The boundaries of this area are defined by an arid climate with some of the lowest
precipitation rates in Texas, with annual rainfall recorded at eight to fourteen inches, which supports desert
shrub vegetation dominated by creosote bushes on the alkaline and gypsiferous soils (Griffith et al. 2007).
The elevation of the Chihuahuan Basins and Playas range from 1,200 to 4,500 feet above mean sea level
(amsl) with local relief varying from 25 to 500 feet (Griffith et al. 2007:10). The major drainage of the
approximately 12,625 square mile ecoregion is the Pecos River which carries runoff from New Mexico to
the north (Griffith et al. 2007:8-9). Otherwise, the ecoregion is primarily internally drained, resulting in
alkaline soils but an efficient recharge rate of local aquifers.
The desert setting of the APE results in relatively sparse vegetation and excellent ground surface visibility
GSV). The dominant creosote bush is an example of the resilient regional flora which can tolerate the
diurnal temperature range, low moisture conditions, and high evapotranspiration rates of the region.
Additional ecotones include the high saline environments of the playas where saltbush and alkali sacaton
may be found along the margins of these dry saltpans and playas (Griffith et al. 2007:8). Honey mesquite,
yucca, and mixed grasses are found intermittently in the region.
The elevation of the APE on City of Midland lands ranges from approximately 2,875 to 3,000 feet (876 to
914 m) amsl. The highest point within the APE on City of Midland Lands is at the west end of the west
lateral (Figure 2.1). The lowest elevation within the APE on the City of Midland lands is at the east end of
the north lateral (Figure 2.2). Surface waters within the APE on City of Midland lands drain internally into
Monument Draw approximately 3.4 miles (5.5 km) southeast of the APE. The APE on City of Midland
lands is underlain by Holocene sand sheet deposits with large areas of windblown dunes (Barnes et al 1992).

The soils encountered within the APE on City of Midland lands are presented alphabetically in Table 1.
The majority of soils result from alluvial and eolian deposits of calcareous parent material. Due to aridity,
salinity, alkalinity, and generally shallow depth to bedrock, none of the soils are considered “prime
farmland” (United States Department of Agriculture [USDA] 2018). The shallow, Blakeney, Wickett, and
Sharvana soils are highly unlikely to contain deeply buried cultural deposits.

*Data compiled from USDA (2018)
Winkler County has a subtropical-semi desert climate with relatively short mild winters and long hot
summers (Rives et al. 1999). The average daily temperature is 45 Fahrenheit (°F) in the winter and 83°F in
the summer. Annual rainfall averages about 12.4 inches (31.5 cm) with over 80 percent of the annual rainfall
typically occurring from April to September. The average relative humidity ranges from 43 during the
daytime and 74 percent at nighttime. There is an average of 3.4 inches (8.6 cm) of snow annually, with an
average of 1 inch of snow on the ground for at least one day annually. The growing season is generally
from the beginning of April to the end of October, and averages approximately 210 days (Rives et al. 1999).

ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND

Based on the archeological record, people have inhabited the region for the last 12,000 years. The
archeological chronology has commonly been broken into five temporal periods. The dates assigned to
those periods differ between authors but generally include the Paleoindian Period (ca. 10,000 to 6,000 B.C.),
Archaic Period (ca. 6,000 B.C. to A.D. 500), Late Prehistoric Period (ca. A.D. 500 to 1500), Protohistoric
Period (ca. A.D. 1500 to 1700), and Historic Period (ca. A.D. 1700 to 1950) (adapted from Boyd 2004,
Perttula 2004, and Raily 2016:54). A summary of the culture history of the region is presented below. For
additional information on the cultural history of the region and a more detailed review, the reader is directed
to the works by Railey (2013, 2016) and Turner, Hester, and McReynolds (2011).
Paleoindian Period
Evidence for prehistoric occupation of the area is relatively scarce in the Paleoindian Period (ca. 10,000 to
6,000 B.C.). It probable that earlier sites have been lost to erosion due to the geological context of the area
(Boyd 1997:7). Paleoindian sites are more common and more reliably dated on the eastern Edwards Plateau
and southern High Plains, although sites and isolated artifacts have been recorded. Although there is
growing evidence for human presence in the Americas, Clovis is the first well-defined cultural horizon in
Cultural Resources Report: Proposed Lilis Gathering System Pipeline City of Midland Lands

Page 6

the region. The remains of large herbivores are found in association with Clovis artifacts but there is more
recent research supporting the procurement of smaller animals and plants during this time. The Clovis
projectile points are lanceolate in shape and have fluted bases. Subsequent Paleoindian projectile points
include Folsom and Plainview (Turner, Hester, and McReynolds 2011:45). These projectile points were
typically hafted to spears, which were often thrown with the aid of atlatls. The Shifting Sands site, a Winkler
County Folsom occupation site which has produced evidence beyond the isolated points, represents
research into the Paleoindian tradition in close proximity to the project vicinity (Hofman 1990).
Archaic Period
With the extinction of megafauna, the Archaic Period (ca. 6,000 B.C. to A.D. 500) is generally defined by
broader subsistence practices and an increase in intensity of resource exploitation. The climate transitioned
from the dryer Altithermal in the Early Archaic through the Late Holocene Wet Period to the relatively dry
in the Late Archaic Medieval Period (Railey 2016:59-83). Additionally, temperatures appear to have
increased which resulted in changes to the biotic community and the subsequent subsistence strategies of
the Archaic Period populations of the region. Fire cracked rock and oxidized rock is relatively common
during this period and likely results from hearths and ovens. Although resource exploitation is inferred to
be more intense, subsistence appears to be focused on seasonal mobility tied in part to bison hunting (Boyd
1997). Campsites and rock shelters have been identified from this period, mostly from the Late Archaic.
Projectile points are normally barbed spear or dart points, and plant-processing tools increase through time
(Johnson and Holliday 2004). There is an increase in the number of recorded sites in the region attributed
to the Late Archaic in terms of both diagnostic points and radiocarbon dates (Railey 2016:75, 86). The
overall inference is an increase in the population of the region during the Late Archaic (Railey 2016:75).
Late Prehistoric Period
The Late Prehistoric or Ceramic Period (ca. A.D. 500 to 1500) is marked by the presence of ceramics and
smaller projectile points indicating the switch from atlatl and spear to the bow and arrow (Johnson and
Holliday 2004). This period is also known as the Formative Period in the nearby western Trans-Pecos
because of the area’s inclusion within the Jornada Mogollon culture of the greater Southwest archeological
region (Railey 2016: 9). Due to further drying of the climate, bison appear to become scarcer in this region.
Trading is inferred to have occurred with Southwestern groups including the Jornada Mogollon (Boyd
1997). Brownware pottery was imported from the Puebloans and habitation structures from this period
include pit houses. Campsites were still likely used during parts of the year and would be representative of
seasonal mobility. Subsistence practices in the Southern High Plains of the Texas Panhandle to the northeast
included the introduction of maize by A.D. 1000 (Drass 2008), and maize has been found in caves to the
west in the Guadalupe Mountains, and to the south on the Marfa Plain (Railey 2016:99-101, 132). However,
the region continued to be dominated by mobile hunter-gatherers (Railey 2016:132), and regional
subsistence in Winkler County does not include evidence of cultivated resources (Railey 2016: 99-101,
132). In the latter part of the period, prestige goods like Olivella shell beads, turquoise, non-local pottery,
and obsidian become more common.
Protohistoric Period
The Protohistoric Period (ca. A.D. 1500 to 1700) begins with direct and indirect European influences in the
region. This period is also known as the Post-Formative Period in the nearby western Trans-Pecos and New
Mexico (Railey 2016:134-140). European settlement did not begin to seriously disrupt aboriginal habitation
until after A.D. 1700. European diseases, probably introduced by explorers and early traders, did have
impacts as early as A.D. 1528. At least 30 epidemics were recorded among Texas tribes between A.D. 1528
and 1890 (Ewers 1974). Further to the west in the project region the Railey defines this era as the PostFormative Native Americans (After A.D. 1450). There is widespread abandonment of the villages and
Cultural Resources Report: Proposed Lilis Gathering System Pipeline City of Midland Lands

associated lifestyle on the southern High Plains, the Jornada Mogollon and even the Casa Grandes Region
(Railey 2016:134). There is limited evidence of sites dating to the Post Formative Period in the study region
and in Southeast New Mexico (Railey 2016:137). With the abandonment of the village lifeway, the nomadic
bison hunters either did not leave a record that is temporally recognizable via radiocarbon dating, or material
culture that can only be attributed to this era. Railey refers to this as a ‘low archaeological visibility”
problem for sites from the Post-Formative Period (2016:140). Whether populations totally abandoned the
region remains unclear.
Historic Period (A.D. 1700 to 1950)
Spanish explorers began expeditions in the Gulf of Mexico beginning in the early 1500s followed by
Catholic missionaries accompanied by Spanish soldiers. The Spanish, while teaching locals Christianity
and farming, attempted to make loyal Spanish citizens. The first missions were established in Mexico, but
were later built in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas (Campbell 2003:36-38). The French,
partially to stem the advance of the Spanish, wanted to increase their fur trading territory and gain control
of the Mississippi River valley. By 1682, LaSalle, a Frenchman, launched an expedition down the
Mississippi River that claimed all of the Lands drained by the river for France followed by a colonization
effort to settle the mouth of the Mississippi River. Subsequent to the French incursion into the region, the
Spanish increased the rate of establishing settlements in Texas (Campbell 2003:41-45, 48).
The Spanish mission system did not expand during the eighteenth century. Native American attacks and a
lack of colonists contributed to the decline of Spanish settlement in Texas. In 1762, the Spanish acquired
Louisiana from the French, which slowed the need to settle east Texas. In 1800, Spain ceded Louisiana to
France, who then sold it to the United States. From 1800 to the 1820s, the population of Texas decreased
as a result of the effects of the Mexican Revolution. In 1821, Mexico finally became an independent nation,
separate from Spain. This newly independent country encouraged Anglo-American settlement within
Texas; this effort was led by Stephen F. Austin. Austin came to an agreement with the Mexican government
in which he would bring settlers to Texas and, in return, he would be rewarded with land and money. By
1830, ten thousand Anglo-Americans, mostly from the American southeast, had settled in Texas (Campbell
2003:105-110).
Texas operated as an independent nation for 10 years (1836 to 1846) and during this time, the Mexican
government never truly recognized its independence. In 1846, Texas was annexed by the United States and
it was now up to the U.S. government to settle the border dispute with Mexico. The Mexicans claimed the
international border as the Nueces River, while the U.S. claimed the Rio Grande as the demarcation line.
After two years of skirmishes and an attack on Mexico City, the United States succeeded in its efforts; with
the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Mexico recognized the Rio Grande as the border and ceded the entire
southwest to the Pacific Ocean to the U.S. (McComb 1989:57).
At the time of annexation by the United States, west Texas was relatively unexplored territory, home to
various Native American groups. Settlers began slowly pushing into this territory in the mid-nineteenth
century. In 1848, the U.S. Army stationed troops in west Texas and created travel routes through this new
territory, which would become corridors for pioneers traveling to California. These included the Chihuahua
Trail, which led from Mexico to Indianola, Texas, and Horsehead Crossing and Castle Gap in Crane County,
all of which were utilized as trade networks during the prehistoric period as well as forming part of a historic
transportation corridor linking Mexico, the U.S. and Canada. Castle Gap functioned as a primary route for the
U.S. Cavalry, California Forty-niners, cattle drives, stage coaches, and wagon trains.
During the Civil War, Texas was a large contributor to the Confederacy, but differed significantly from
other southern states. Texas was a frontier state, with a diversified population of Mexicans, AngloAmericans, and Native Americans. The state also had a large European immigrant population, many of
Cultural Resources Report: Proposed Lilis Gathering System Pipeline City of Midland Lands

Page 8

whom were small farmers. Two-thirds of the farmers in the state were non-slave holding, which meant that
the agricultural economy was maintained following the Civil War. In addition, cattle ranches were a large
industry, resulting in economic diversity. Thus, Texas was not as negatively impacted economically as other
southern states during post-Civil War Reconstruction (Campbell 2003:209, 213).
The Native American groups of Texas saw the defeat of the Confederacy and the weakening of Texas as a
chance to regain Lands they had lost. During this period, the Comanche and Apache occupied the areas of
west Texas. In response to this increase of Native American attacks, the United States sent troops to
reoccupy several forts. By 1874, a major campaign was initiated in Texas that took away Native Americans’
horses, destroyed their villages, and forced them to return to their reservations. The consolidation of Native
Americans on reservations allowed Anglo-Americans to settle permanently in west Texas (Campbell
2003:291, 295).
Following these campaigns, the military sent troops to conduct detailed expeditions of the former Native
American Lands. By 1876, several of the counties northeast of the APE were surveyed by parties from Fort
Concho. Ranchers moved into these areas and began raising large herds of cattle, as the demand for beef
had risen after the Civil War. New cattle trails developed throughout west Texas, where large herds were
driven hundreds of miles north to the mid-western railroad routes. In 1881, the Texas and Pacific Railway
extended their rail lines through west Texas; up to this point, rail transportation was only available in east
Texas. Between the 1870s and 1890s, 8,000 miles of railway track were laid, connecting the entire state.
The new railroads significantly reduced the time and distance it took the cattle industry to transport their
herds to market (Campbell 2003:297, 306).
The expansion of the railroad connected the rural communities of west Texas with the booming cities to
the east. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, cattle ranchers began to fence off their herds and create
small communities on the frontier. In 1895, a law was passed that broke up these larger ranches, allowing
farmers to purchase smaller tracts of land. This led to the end of open-range ranching and attracted
additional settlers. West Texas communities generally grew slowly due to poor soil conditions and the
difficulty of accessing water. People began to farm corn and cotton on the newly settled land, but ranching
was still the dominant economic activity of west Texas at the end of the nineteenth century.
Winkler County is located on the east side of the Pecos River Valley in west Texas and is comprised of
840 square miles of primarily flat to gently rolling Lands (Smith 2010a). Winkler County is bordered by
Andrews County to the northeast, Ector County to the east, Ward County to the south, Loving County to
the west, and Lea County, New Mexico to the northwest. The Texas and Pacific Railway was constructed
through the area in 1881, crossing Ward County from east to west several miles south of modern Winkler
County, giving the general region transportation options, which resulted in regional development in the
surrounding counties. The dense grasslands with good water options drew a few settlers practicing open
range ranching to the area; and Winkler County was established from Tom Green County in 1887 and by
1890, eleven men and seven women were reported as the population of the county (Smith 2010a). The
subsequent census of 1900 reported 12 ranches with 11,982 head of cattle and 60 persons inhabiting
Winkler County. The Public School Lands rush of the early 1900s brought additional settlers to all of West
Texas and resulted in population increases across the formerly sparsely settled region, and the nominally
organized Winkler County experienced an increase as well to 412 residents in the 1910 Census (Smith
2010a). The county was also formerly organized on April 5, 1910 with the town of Kermit as the county
seat (Smith 2010a). The census of 1910 counted 128 farms, with a total acreage reported at only 230 acres
in small corn and hay operations, 10,000 head of cattle, and almost 4,000 sheep (Smith 2010a). In contrast,
to the southwest of the Pecos River, 25 miles away in irrigated areas of Reeves County, the 1900 census
reported 63 farms totaling 900,000 acres of farmland and 51,000 head of cattle (Smith 2010b). Intermittent
droughts affected the region, as noted above, and by 1920, only 81 residents remained in the county on 27
farms (Smith 2010a).

The discovery of oil in the county in 1926 altered the county economy and led to a large increase in the
population. The Hendrick Field was initially discovered by random drilling on July 16, 1926, and by
September 1927, was producing an average of 10,580 barrels of oil a day from 19 wells operated by six
different drilling companies (Smith 2010c). The Hendrick Field oil boom created the town of Wink, located
just over seven miles southwest of Kermit, and led to the rise of several other short-lived boomtowns in the
region (Smith 2010a). The boom increased the population of the county from the 81 residents noted above
in 1920, to 6,784 enumerated in the 1930 census (Smith 2010a). To the contrary, the number of farms
reported in 1930 decreased to 25, operated by 14 owners and 11 tenants, but the number of cattle remained
steady at 11,000 head (Smith 2010a). Through 1960 the oil and gas industry continued to dominate the
economy of the county, but ranching remained steady and the population grew to 10,064 residents in 1950,
and a peak of 13,652 residents in 1960 (Smith 2010a). In 2010, the estimated population of the county was
7,110, with a July 1, 2016 estimate of 7,893, and the current July 1, 2017 estimate of 7,574 (United States
Census Bureau 2019). The dominant industry of the county is oil and gas development, followed by cattle
ranching.

METHODOLOGY

The cultural resources survey followed the THC’s Archeological Survey Standards for Texas. The APE
was surveyed by using parallel pedestrian transects spaced no more than 50 feet (15 m) apart. The entire
100 foot (30 m) wide APE within the proposed Lilis Gathering System Pipelines APE on City of Midland
lands was subjected to pedestrian survey for cultural resources.
Shovel testing density within the survey followed minimum standards outlined by the THC’s and the
Council of Texas Archeologists’ (CTA) practices and procedures, which call for 16 shovel tests per mile is
settings which have the potential for buried deposits. Shovel testing is not required in areas with slopes
greater than 20 percent or which do not exhibit potential for buried deposits. Shovel test pits are also not
excavated in areas with standing water or in areas in which underground utilities are present.
Shovel tests generally measure 30 cm in diameter and are excavated by digging to bedrock, a stratigraphic
deposit (e.g. subsoil) that is determined to be below Holocene aged deposits, or to 80-100 cm (dependent
on soil matrix consistency and hardness). All shovel test pit fill is passed through ¼ inch mesh screen or
gone through by hand if the soil will not pass through the screen. Shovel test pits are excavated in arbitrary
10 cm levels unless stratigraphic changes are observed. The cultural resources survey of the 100 foot (30
m) wide APE met the minimum standards outlined by the THC’s and the CTA’s practices and procedures
(13 TAC 26.5 and 26.20).

BACKGROUND RESEARCH

Prior to the field survey, a search of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (the Atlas) was conducted by
Michael M. Margolis to locate previously recorded archeological sites, archeological surveys, NRHP
properties, and SALs. Based on the Atlas, no sites have been previously recorded within 1-mile of the APE.
Based on the Atlas, there have been no previous archeological surveys or studies within 1-mile of the APE.
The overall background research of the region suggests that the APE is located within a larger area where
climatic conditions, burrowing rodents, and the effects of ranching and oil and gas exploration have each
effected the cultural landscape leading to two types of general settings. Wind erosion and extensive
bioturbation from rodent burrowing, and sheep and cattle grazing have exposed the upper surface of the
Cultural Resources Report: Proposed Lilis Gathering System Pipeline City of Midland Lands

landscape within the Chihuahuan Basins and Playas. With the exception of a few geomorphological
locations, archeological sites of all ages may be located on the exposed ground surface and/or were never
buried (Hall 2006:2-7). The majority of archeological sites are located on eroded surfaces and therefore
lack vertical integrity and stratigraphy (Hall 2006:2-15). While intact archeological deposits may be
encountered where depositional processes, such as (a) colluvial; (b) eolian sand deposits associated with
the playa margins; (c) upland playa and lake fill deposits; and (d) within and adjacent to extant and/or
extinct draws and/or drainages of Late-Pleistocene to early Holocene age (Hall 2006:2-7, 2-11; Johnson
and Holliday 2004:285, 290, 294). The APE on City of Midland lands is located within the areas of eroded
and exposed surfaces, and sites would be expected to be resting on the surface, or ephemerally exposed by
shifting sand dunes.

RESULTS

The cultural resources survey of the Lilis Gathering System Pipelines on City of Midland lands was
conducted October 2 and 10-12, 2018 by ENERCON archeologists Gary D. Edington and Christopher
Flowers. The entire project was supervised by Gary D. Edington, an ENERCON archeologist who meets
the U.S. Secretary of the Interior’s Professional Qualification Standards for archeology as set forth in 36
CFR 61. The cultural resources survey corridor was 100 feet (30 m) wide for the entire 7.80-mile (12.55
km) length of the pipeline segment through City of Midland lands (Figure 2.1 and 2.2, Appendix A: Figures
1-6). The total area inspected during the cultural resources survey was 94.55 acres (38.26 hectares).
During the fieldwork the weather was seasonal, with low temperatures ranging from the upper 40s°F to
60s°F, and daily high temperatures ranging from 70’s°F to the low-90s°F, with clear, partly cloudy and
overcast skies and relatively low to intermediate winds. The terrain of the APE was flat to gently sloped
with some rolling active sand dunes and low to moderate levels of surficial caliche gravels and exposed
caliche bedrock. Vegetation generally consisted of mesquite trees, creosote bush, sand sage, and thin mixed
grasses (Figures 3-10). GSV ranged from 50 to 95 percent, with an average greater than 60 percent (Figures
3-10).

Site 41WK137
The cultural resources survey resulted in the recording of one new archeological site. Site 41WK137 is a
scatter of domestic household debris dating to the mid-20th century and a detached garage stem wall and
foundation (Figures 12-16, Appendix A: Figure 6). The house site has been razed by bulldozing resulting
in a scatter of three whiteware sherds, three sun-colored amethyst (SCA) and two milk glass fragments,
three stoneware/crockery sherds, one shotgun shell, barbwire, miscellaneous metal, one Coors ring-tab can
and a few concrete and brick fragments. An Aermotor Chicago windmill and a large water tank are located
well east of the proposed ROW (Appendix A: Figure 6, Appendix B).
The windmill and water tank were not depicted on the USGS Cheyenne Draw, Tex. (1970) 7.5 Minute
Quadrangle map, while other windmills in the area are depicted and labeled (USGS 1970). The windmill
was identified as a model 702 based on the sail mounting technique and the Aermotor Chicago on the
tailfin/vain (Baker 1985; O’Brock 1989). The model 702 Aermotor Chicago windmill was produced from
1933 forward and continued into the last decade of the 20th century. The tailfin/vain observed was clearly
marked Chicago, and model 702s produced after 1970 were marked Argentina or simply Aermotor until
1981, then Aermotor USA or simply Aermotor (Baker 1985: 114-117; O’Brock 1989; Wilbanks no date).
The 702 model is one of the most popular models of windmills in the US, and Baker observed that “many
thousands were still in operation in the US and abroad in the 1980s” (Baker 1985:117). The manufacture
dates of 1933 to 1970 for the windmill supports other dates for the materials observed at the site, but alone
it is a poor temporal marker. The actual date of manufacture is known to be stamped inside the housing
covering the model 702 gear mechanism. That part date could also prove anachronistic due to the possibility
of a used windmill being moved to the site, or to part replacement giving a date prior to actual installation,
or after the domestic use of the property. The windmill is still in operational condition.
The house and detached garage structure are both depicted on the USGS 1970 map, with the area of the
windmill and stock tank depicted only as a clearing in the mesquite and creosote bush dominated setting
(USGS 1970). Aerial photography from 1954 and 1968, as well as modern aerials from 1995 to present
were reviewed in order to delineate what structures were present over the last 65 years at the site location.
Unfortunately, the 1954 aerial photographs do not clearly delineate the site or the structures which may
have been present at the location due to cloud cover, although it is clear that some features were present at
the location (USGS 1954). The aerial photograph from 1968 clearly shows the house, garage, a large water
tank, a small stock tank, two windmills, and four corral features (Appendix B; USGS 1968). The aerial
photograph seems to show a fenced back yard to the west of the house with the second windmill present at
the northwest corner of fenced backyard. Of these features which are visible on the aerial photograph dated
2-5-1968, only the large stock tank, the north windmill, the garage slab foundation and stem wall, and a
dilapidated barbed wire fence remain. All other features have been removed by bulldozing or time.
All diagnostic materials date from the 20th century. SCA glass was manufactured from the late 19th century
until the mid-1920s, but typically dates from 1910 to 1920 (Lockhart 2006). The ring-tab Coors can
manufacture dates ranges from 1965 to 1975 (De Pastino 2015). All domestic structures have been removed
from the site.

A review of the Handbook to Texas Online and other resources gave insight into owners of the property in
the early 20th century, however some sources conflict with others. According to the Handbook of Texas
Online, three Cowden brothers, George (Doc), John, and William H., operated a ranch with line camps
spread from Horsehead Crossing in Pecos County, Texas to Carlsbad, New Mexico (Anderson 2010a). The
Cowden Ranch was noted for the JAL brand, and would play an integral role in the founding of the modern
community of Jal, New Mexico, 10 miles to the northeast of site 41WK137 (Anderson 2010a). A review
of the online site Find A Grave revealed that although Charles Webster Cowden was a brother (Find A
Grave 2020a, 2020b) of the founders and operators of the famous Cowden Ranch, he is not listed as one of
the participants or owners of the ranch by some authors (Anderson 2010a, 2010b), and he is not listed as
Cultural Resources Report: Proposed Lilis Gathering System Pipeline City of Midland Lands

Page 20

the owner of any brand by historians of the family (Pettit 2006: 162-164). Pettit does list “Buck (Charles
Webster) Cowden” as one of the brothers who initially moved their herd from Palo Pinto County to the
Sand Hills in 1883 (Pettit 2006:143) to the east of site 41WK137. Pettit depicts many of the watering areas
and wells attributed to the Cowden’s during the JAL years to the east in the Sand Hills, and to the north in
New Mexico (2006:144,151), but the map does not show this location as one of the JAL Cowden Ranch
water stations. William Henry Cowden, the renowned Midland Banker and Texas cattlemen, sold his
interest in the JAL Cowden ranch to his brothers in 1892 and pursued his own cattle interests in Andrews,
Crane and Frio counties, Texas, and Indian Territory (Anderson 2010b). John M. Cowden bought out the
remaining brothers in 1912 and continued operate the JAL Cowden Ranch from Midland until all the tracts
were eventually sold (Anderson 2010b).
The tract of land at site 41WK137 was acquired by C. W. Cowden on August 20, 1913 as noted above in
the chain of title research, C.W. Cowden passed on July 23, 1915, 23 months after this acquisition and was
buried in Abilene, Texas (Find A Grave 2020b). Charles Webster Cowden was born in 1860 to William
Hamby Cowden and Carrie M. Cowden (Find A Grave 2020b). C.W. married Lydia Paralee Lewis in 1885
in Palo Pinto County Texas. C.W. appears on the 1880 census as a 20 year old “cattle herder” in his father’s
household in Palo Pinto Precinct 3 (The United States Department of Commerce and Labor-Bureau of the
Census [USDCLBC]). 1900 census record lists C.W. Cowden and wife Lydia residing in Eddy County,
New Mexico with the three children born prior to 1900, Clarence, Carrye, and Annie Lee. Charles listed
his occupation as a stock raiser and owned a home with no mortgage (USDCLBC 1900a). Clarence Calvin
Cowden’s place of birth in 1885 was Palo Pinto, Texas where the Cowden Brothers began their ranching
activities in the mid-1880s (Petit 2006; Anderson 2010a, 2010b). While Carrye was born in Midland in
1897, Annie Lee, and Birdie were born in 1889, and 1891 in Roswell, New Mexico (Find A Grave 2020b).
The 1910 census records list Charles Webster Cowden residing in Abilene, Texas as a homeowner and
retail merchant (hardware), with the 1914 Abilene phonebook listing the store as Cowden-Payton Hardware
Co, owned by CW, Clarence Cowden, and L.C. Payton (USDCLBC 1910a; Worley’s Directory 1914). The
Cowden Family is a prominent ranching family in West Texas and New Mexico (Petit 2006) and many of
the family have been significant in the history of both states. It would appear that this tract of land was
acquired by Charles W. Cowden too late to have been a part of the JAL branded Cowden Ranch.
Information from census data and the 1914 Worley Directory of Abilene would indicate the Charles, his
son Clarence and L. C. Payton all lived in Abilene running the hardware store when the property was
acquired in the mid-1910s (USDCLB 1910a, 1910b). Additional census data from the 1920 and 1930 census
continues to indicate residency in Abilene by all the family members (USDCLB 1920a, 1930a) other than
Birdie Spaulding and her husband Marvin H. Spaulding who is noted in the 1920 census in Winkler County,
Texas as a farmer on a stock farm (USDCLBC 1920b). While it is possible that Marvin and Birdie Spauling
resided at this property in 1920, the census information is inconclusive as to their residence, beyond rural
Winkler County (USDCLBC 1920b). By 1930 Marvin and Birdie Spaulding resided in Lubbock in a home
they owned, where Marvin’s occupation was listed as lumber salesmen (USDCLBC 1930b). All reasonably
available records are inconclusive as to when the property was occupied, at what date the house, garage and
numerous corrals were built, and who occupied the ranch and watering station.
While it could be argued that C.W. Cowden was significant in the history of ranching in the region, it
appears he never lived on this tract of land and was only an investor or absentee owner, not the individual
responsible for the features viewable on aerial photos from the mid-20th century or the development of the
property into a cattle ranch and watering station in use through the middle of the 20th century. A review of
available online resources failed to find any indication that any individuals associated with SW ¼ Section
13, Block C23, PSL Survey listed above were persons significant in the history of Texas or the region.

IF#1
The cultural resources survey also resulted in the observation of one isolated find (IF). IF#1 consisted of a
single modified tertiary flake of mottled white chert which was observed on the ground surface (Figure
16, Appendix A: Figure 4). An intensive pedestrian grid at 3-5 m intervals failed to reveal any additional
prehistoric materials. A total of five shovel tests placed in the vicinity of IF#1 were all negative for
cultural materials, and the single modified flake was noted as IF#1 (Appendix A: Figure 4, Appendix C).

Figure 16. IF#1, a modified tertiary flake of mottled white chert.
The APE on City of Midland lands has been subject to multiple ground disturbing activities, including,
cattle grazing and oilfield disturbances, such as pipeline ROW construction and maintenance, well pad
construction and maintenance, and lease road construction and maintenance.
Due to distance from natural water sources, generally shallow soils, low to moderate levels of surficial
gravels, disturbances by oilfield construction activities, the soils within the APE on City of Midland lands
were determined to possess limited potential to contain buried cultural deposits. As a result, no shovel tests
were excavated within the APE on City of Midland lands except within the immediate vicinity of IF#1.
No additional cultural materials, including prehistoric or 19th to mid-20th century artifacts, features, cultural
lenses or sites were observed during the cultural resources survey of the Lilis Gathering System Pipelines
on City of Midland lands.

RECOMMENDATIONS

ENERCON, in support of Salt Creek Midstream, LLC, conducted an intensive cultural resources
investigation for the proposed Lilis Gathering System Pipelines located near Kermit, in Winkler County,
Texas. The proposed Lilis Gathering System Pipelines consists of three lateral pipelines extending from the
existing Salt Creek Midstream, LLC Bunker Hill (North Trunk) Pipeline. The three lateral pipelines total
10.16 miles (16.53 km) in length. This report encompasses only the two pipelines of the proposed Lilis
Gathering System on City of Midland lands. The two Lilis Gathering System Pipelines on City of Midland
lands total approximately 7.80 miles (12.55 km) in length and are depicted on the USGS Cheyenne Draw,
Tex. (1970) 7.5 Minute Quadrangle. The construction corridor consists of a 50 feet (15 m) wide permanent
pipeline right-of-way (ROW) and an additional 50 feet (15 m) wide temporary workspace corridor. The
cultural resources survey APE on City of Midland lands consists of the 7.80 mi (12.55 km) by 100 feet (30
m) corridor, totaling 94.55 acres (38.26 hectares).
The cultural resources field survey and report are intended to assist in adhering to the 1969 Antiquities
Code of Texas and the field survey of the City of Midland lands was completed under Texas Antiquities
Permit No. 9015. The entire project was supervised by Gary D. Edington, an ENERCON archeologist who
meets the U.S. Secretary of the Interior’s Professional Qualification Standards for archeology as set forth
in 36 CFR 61.
Prior to the field survey, a search of the Atlas was conducted by Michael M. Margolis to locate previously
recorded archeological sites, archeological surveys, NRHP properties, and SALs. Based on the Atlas, no
sites have been previously recorded within 1-mile of the APE. Based on the Atlas, there have been no
previous archeological studies within 1-mile of the APE.
The cultural resources survey on City of Midland lands was conducted October 2 and 10-12, 2018 by
Christopher Flowers and Gary D. Edington. Fieldwork was conducted in accordance with the THC
Archeological Survey Standards for Texas.
The cultural resources survey resulted in the recording of one new archeological site, 41WK137, and the
observation of one isolated find, IF#1. Site 41WK137 is a scatter of domestic household debris and a stem
wall and foundation of a detached garage, dating to the mid-20th century. The house site has been razed by
bulldozing resulting in a scatter of domestic trash and structural debris. An Aermotor Chicago windmill
and a large water tank are located east of the APE. 41WK137 lacks further information potential and no
further work is recommended at the site. Due to the lack of information potential, site 41WK137 is
recommended not eligible for listing on the NRHP or designation as a SAL. IF#1 consisted of a single
tertiary flake of white chert which was observed on the ground surface. An intensive pedestrian grid at 3-5
m intervals, and five shovel tests placed in the vicinity of IF#1 failed to reveal any additional cultural
materials. IF#1 lacks additional information potential and is therefore not eligible for listing on the NRHP
or designation as a SAL.
The cultural resources survey of the Lilis Gathering System Pipelines APE did not result in finding any
additional prehistoric or historic artifacts, features, cultural lenses, or sites and no artifacts were collected
on City of Midland lands. Therefore, it is recommended that construction of the proposed Lilis Gathering
System Pipelines on City of Midland lands will have no effect on any historic property that may qualify for
inclusion on the NRHP or SAL listings. No further cultural resources investigations are recommended prior
to construction of the Lilis Gathering System Pipelines on City of Midland lands. If cultural material,
including sites, features, or artifacts that are 50 years old or older are encountered within the ROW on City
of Midland lands during construction of Lilis Gathering System Pipelines, work in the area must cease and
the regional THC Archeologist must be notified immediately.

A review of the Handbook to Texas Online and other resources gave insight into owners of the property in
the early 20th century, however some sources conflict with others. According to the Handbook of Texas
Online, three Cowden brothers, George (Doc), John and William H., operated a ranch with line camps
spread from Horsehead Crossing in Pecos County, Texas to Carlsbad, New Mexico (Anderson 2010a). The
Cowden Ranch was noted for the JAL brand, and would play an integral role in the founding of the modern
community of Jal, New Mexico, 10 miles to the northeast of site 41WK137 (Anderson 2010a). A review
of the online site Find A Grave revealed that although Charles Webster Cowden was a brother (Find A
Grave 2020a, 2020b) of the founders and operators of the famous Cowden Ranch, he is not listed as one of
Page 48

the participants or owners of the ranch by some authors (Anderson 2010a, 2010b), and he is not listed as
the owner of any brand by historians of the family (Pettit 2006: 162-164). Pettit does list “Buck (Charles
Webster) Cowden” as one of the brothers who initially moved their herd from Palo Pinto County to the
Sand Hills in 1883 (Pettit 2006:143) to the east of site 41WK137. Pettit depicts many of the watering areas
and wells attributed to the Cowden’s during the JAL years to the east in the Sand Hills, and to the north in
New Mexico (2006:144,151), but the map does not show this location as one of the JAL Cowden Ranch
water stations. William Henry Cowden the renowned Midland Banker and Texas cattlemen sold his interest
in the JAL Cowden ranch to his brothers in 1892 and pursued his own cattle interests in Andrews, Crane
and Frio counties, Texas, and Indian Territory (Anderson 2010b). John M. Cowden bought out the
remaining brothers in 1912 and continued operate the JAL Cowden Ranch from Midland until all the tracts
were eventually sold (Anderson 2010b).
The tract of land at site 41WK137 was acquired by C. W. Cowden on August 20, 1913 as noted above in
the chain of title research, C.W. Cowden passed on July 23, 1915, 23 months after this acquisition and was
buried in Abilene, Texas (Find A Grave 2020b). Charles Webster Cowden was born in 1860 to William
Hamby Cowden and Carrie M. Cowden (Find A Grave 2020b). C.W. married Lydia Paralee Lewis in 1885
in Palo Pinto County Texas. C.W. appears on the 1880 census as a 20 year old “cattle herder” in his father’s
household in Palo Pinto Precinct 3 (The United States Department of Commerce and Labor-Bureau of the
Census [USDCLBC]). 1900 census record lists C.W. Cowden and wife Lydia residing in Eddy County,
New Mexico with the three children born prior to 1900, Clarence, Carrye, and Annie Lee. Charles listed
his occupation as a stock raiser and owned a home with no mortgage (USDCLBC 1900a). Clarence Calvin
Cowden’s place of birth in 1885 was Palo Pinto, Texas where the Cowden Brothers began their ranching
activities in the mid-1880s (Petit 2006; Anderson 2010a, 2010b). While Carrye was born in Midland in
1897, Annie Lee, and Birdie were born in 1889, and 1891 in Roswell, New Mexico (Find A Grave 2020b).
The 1910 census records list Charles Webster Cowden residing in Abilene, Texas as a homeowner and
retail merchant (hardware), with the 1914 Abilene phonebook listing the store as Cowden-Payton Hardware
Co, owned by CW, Clarence Cowden, and L.C. Payton (USDCLBC 1910a; Worley’s Directory 1914). The
Cowden Family is a prominent ranching family in West Texas and New Mexico (Petit 2006) and many of
the family have been significant in the history of both states. It would appear that this tract of land was
acquired by Charles W. Cowden too late to have been a part of the JAL branded Cowden Ranch.
Information from census data and the 1914 Worley Directory of Abilene would indicate the Charles, his
son Clarence and L. C. Payton all lived in Abilene running the hardware store when the property was
acquired in the mid-1910s (USDCLB 1910a, 1910b). Additional census data from the 1920 and 1930 census
continues to indicate residency in Abilene by all the family members (USDCLB 1920a, 1930a) other than
Birdie Spaulding and her husband Marvin H. Spaulding who is noted in the 1920 census in Winkler County,
Texas as a farmer on a stock farm (USDCLBC 1920b) and in 1930 Marvin and Birdie resided in Lubbock
in a home they owned, where Marvin’s occupation was listed as lumber salesmen (USDCLBC 1930b).
While it could be argued that C.W. Cowden was significant in the history of ranching in the region, it
appears he never lived on this tract of land and was only an investor, not the individual responsible for the
features viewable on aerial photos from the mid-20th century or the development of the property into a cattle
ranch and watering station in use through the middle of the 20th century. A review of available online
resources failed to find any indication that any individuals associated with SW ¼ Section 13, Block C23,
PSL Survey listed above were persons significant in the history of Texas or the region.
