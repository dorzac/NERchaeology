August, 1976

Submitted by the Texas Archeological Survey, The University of
Texas at Austin in fulfillment of the terms of Soil Conservation
Service, U. S. Department of Agriculture, Temple, Texas, Purchase
Order No. 2628-TX-SCS-76.

INTRODUCTION

During the months of June and July, 1976, the Texas ArcheologicaJ. Survey conducted additional archeological assessments at seven
previously recorded sites (Patterson 1974) within the Upper San
Marcos Watershed Project, Hays County, Texas. A total of 15 working
days were spent examining, recording, and evaluating archeological
sites: 41HY74, 41HY75, 41HY76 at Floodwater Retarding Structure
S-3 Revised; 41HY84, 41HY86, 41HY88 at Floodwater Retarding Structure S-3A; and 41HY93 at Floodwater Retarding Structure S-1.
The assessments were directed specifically toward determining
the eligibility of each site for nomination to the National Register
of Historic Places.
In accordance with the Soil Conservation
Service request, this report contains a sµggested program of
mitigation for those sites considered to be eligible for nomination
to the Register, and includes a cost estimate for implementing the
suggested program.
The notes, maps, photographs, and other documents accumulated
during this assessment are housed at the Texas Archeological Survey
facilities at the Balcones Research Center, The University of Texas
at Austin. All archeological materials collected are stored at the
Survey facilities pending implementation of any final program of
mitigation at the Upper San Marcos Watershed Project.
Prewitt served as supervising archeologist, and Scott served
as assistant archeologist in direct control of field operations.
The duties of preparing this report have been shared by both.
David S. Dibble, Director of the Survey, acted as prinicpal investigator for the project.
The authors would like to thank the landowners and the Soil
Conservation Service staff at San Marcos for their cooperation
and assistance during the course of this work.
The field crew,
composed of Steve Kotter, Jane Laurens, and Harold G. (Woody)
Woolridge, maintained professional conduct under various adverse
working conditions; they are thanked for their cheerful assistance.
Patience E. Patterson kindly shared her knowledge of the Upper
San Marcos River region.

ASSESSMENTS AT FLOODWATER RETARDING STRUCTURES
S-3 Revised, S-3A, and S-1

Each floodwater retarding structure is discussed separately
in this section. The archeological sites examined during these
investigations are described, the work accomplished at each is
outlined, and an evaluation is presented for the individual sites.
Other sites are present within each of the floodwater retarding
structures; however, their status of eligibility for nomination
to the National Register of Historic Places has been previously
determined and they were not examined during this assessment.
No subsurface probes were made during this assessment.
Investigations were confined to visual inspection, mapping, and the
collection of horizontally controlled samples of exposed surface
debris.

Structure S-3 Revised
Floodwater retarding structure S-3R is located on the Freeman Ranch property, beginning 1/2 mile north of Ranch Road 12 on
the western edge of the Country Estates property and extending
1/2 mile northwest.
It will cross Sink Creek and endanger ten
archeological sites that lie within the 734-foot mean sea level
maximum elevation of the detention pool. Three of these archeological sites, 41HY74, 41HY75, and 41HY76, were recommended for
further work in the belief that they contained material significant
to the study of lithic resource procurement localities on the
Edwards Plateau (Patterson 1974). Debris from the manufacture of
lithic tools is evident on each site. Site 41HY75 contains evidence
of discrete activity areas in addition to its abundant debris. The
centerline of the dam will pass through portions of both 41HY75
and 41HY76. Site 41HY74 lies partially outside the maximum detention pool but may be endangered by construction vehicle activities.
Site 41 HY 74
Description: This site is situated along the top of a steep
knoll on the southeast side of Sink Creek. It lies 1 mile north
of Ranch Road 12 on the western edge of the Freeman Ranch fence
line and immediately behind the Country Estates development area.
It is 600 meters southwest of the dam centerline and partially

3

within the detention pool limits. Access to the site is gained
by crossing property owned by residents of Country Estates.
Site 41HY74 is roughly circular in outline and is 175 x 175
meters at its widest points. On the south it is bordered by the
major gully of a bicournuate drainage, the Freeman Ranch fence to
the east, and uncleared brush to the west. To the north, the
scatter declines in intensity and the limits of the site are
indistinct.
Recent bulldozing has churned the surface of the site and
removed the cover vegetation; as a result, a great amount of debris
which was not previously visible was exposed and the information
potential of the site was seriously damaged. Lateral displacement of the debris has obscured or destroyed any specific workshop areas which may have once existed.
Presently, few artifacts
can be seen interspersed with the dense chipping debris that litters the site.
Work done by the survey: A grid oriented with the long axis
was superimposed upon the site, and is coincidentally north-south.
Another grid line was established along the east-west axis, with
stakes set at 25-meter intervals.
Surface collections were made
at every stake using a 1.787-meter-long string to outline a circular area of 10 square-meters. Any altered material within the
outlined area was collected and deposited in labeled bags. A plane
table map was made and photographs were taken.
Recommendations:
The structural integrity of the site has
been severely modified subsequent to original deposition; the
result is a low information yield potential. This site does not
merit nomination to the National Register of Historic Places.
Site 41 HY 75
Site 41HY75 is situated on the Freeman Ranch property 1/4
mile south of 41HY76.
It is on a moderately steep knoll, 700
meters north of Sink Creek and measures 200 x 275 meters in size.
All of the site lies within the 734-foot mean sea level maximum
detention pool elevation. The site lies between the dam centerline on the northwest and the proposed Borrow Area No. 3 on the
southeast.
Three areas of discrete lithic concentrations were observed
at the site. Area A occupies the northwest part of the site and
is bisected on its western edge by the dam centerline. Cobbles
of broken and whole chert mixed with chipping debris litter the
area. One unidentified dart point fragment was found in this area.

4

Area B lies southeast of Area A and west of the dam centerline. More debris litters this area than was found in Area A.
Broken bifaces, bifacial reduction flakes, cores, and a single
dart point were observed and collected.
Evidence of preferential
selection of fine grain chert cobbles was noted. One area of
quarried chert is visible in this section of the site.
Area C lies east of Area B in the vicinity of Borrow Area
No. 3. Dense accumulations of cobbles and flakes occur on this
part of the site; remnants of all stages of biface reduction appear to be present. Again, fine grain chert appears to have been
the preferred lithic resource in the area.
One unidentified dart
point was found in this part of the site.
· Work done by the survey: A north-south grid line was established across area B with stakes set at 25-meter intervals.
East-west lines were set every 50 meters; these grid lines extended beyond area B to encompass the remaining two site areas.
The surf ace collection proceeded in the same manner utilized on
41HY74, for example, any altered material found in the 10 squaremeter area surrounding each grid stake was collected and placed
in labeled bags. A plane table map was made and photographs were
taken.
Recommendations: Most of 41HY75 lies between the dam centerline and Borrow Areas Nos. 3 and 4.
Damage to this site will undoubtedly be extensive. The potential of this site for yielding
evidence relating to definable stages of bifacial manufacture,
preferential selection of chert cobbles, and possible discrete
workshop areas, is sufficient to warrant its nomination to the
National Register of Historic Places.
Site 41 HY 76
Site 41HY76 is 1/4 mile northwest of 41HY75.
It lies on the
dam centerline at the far northern elbow of the damsite.
The southern half of the site lies within the maximum detention pool elevation.
A light chert scatter bisected by the dam centerline extends
northeast to southwest in an area 75 x 175 meters. Cores, flakes,
and some bif ace fragments are strewn across the brushless field.
The site appears to lack discrete artifact or workshop concentrations.
Work done by the survey: Three east-west grid lines were
measured off of the initial base line (laid 35° west of north) and
surface collections were made at each 25-meter interval. Photographs
were taken and a plane table map was made.
Recommendations: This site is not considered to be of sufficient
significance to merit nomination to the National Register of Historic
Places.

5

Structure S-3A
The proposed maximum detention pool elevation (715 feet msl)
will affect eight archeological sites. Three of these sites,
41HY84, 41HY86, and 41HY88, were chosen for assessment as it was
felt they may contain a record of the progressive stages of lithic
tool manufacture.
Only 41HY84 lies completely within the maximum
detention pool elevation. Both 41HY86 and 41HY88 lie partially
within the maximum detention pool elevation and will suffer some
damage. All three sites lie on the first major left bank tributary
to Sink Creek. Site 41HY86 is assessed to merit further work.

Site 41 HY 84
This site is located 2/5 mile north of the dam centerline on
the fenceline dividing the property of Ruskin C. Norman, Jr.,
and the Northwest Hills Investment Company.
It occurs in a narrow
strip of scatter along the west side of the Sink Creek tributary,
following the contour of a low hill. Although the site measures
150 x 200 meters, the majority of the scatter occupies a 40 meter
wide area that closely parallels the creek outline._ A moderate
scatter of flaking debris, cores, and broken bifaces occurs in
this area. An area of quarried chert is visible near the center
of the site, but no discrete concentrations or isolated workshop areas were observed during work on the site.
Work done by the survey: A base line was established across
the long axis of the site, oriented approximately 10° east of north,
with stakes set at intervals of 25 meters.
East-west grids were
placed across the northern and southern thirds of the site and
surface collected in the same manner as those on Damsite S-3R.
Photographs were taken and a plane table map was made.
Recommendations: Nomination of this site to the National
Register of Historic Places is not considered to be justifiable.
Site 41 HY 86
Site 41HY86 is located 1/2 mile southwest of 41HY84.
It is
situated 200 meters west of the intersection in the pasture road
and directly beneath a powerline which crosses it northwest to
southeast. The dam centerline will end on the eastern edge of
the horseshoe-shaped site. The Sink Creek tributary runs north
of the site, marking the boundary in that direction. Measuring
200 x 275 meters, the site follows a contorted clearing around a

6

low, rocky knoll.
Dense lithic debris occurs at all parts of the
site. Cores, bifaces, dart points, and numerous flakes were
visible with the flakes concentrated in at least a dozen discrete
workshop areas on the site. No other site equaled this one in
abundance and diversity of lithic tools and debris -- every
phase of biface reduction appears to be represented in the materials
at this site. One small area of battered chert visible in the
exposed limestone on the eastern edge on the site may be an
example of a true "quarrying" process.
Work done by the survey: A collection grid was placed along
the long axis of the east side of the site, oriented approximately
25° west of north. An east-west grid was established across the
northern edge of the site to ensure that each portion of the site
was adequately sampled. All stakes were set at 25 meter intervals
and surface collected utilizing the 1.787 meter-long radius "dog
leash" method employed on the other sites. A plane table map was
made and photographs were taken.
Recommendations: The information yield potential for this
site is considered to be substantial. Nomination to the National
Register of Historic Places is certainly warranted.
Site 41 HY 88
Site 41HY88 is almost 1/4 mile due north of 41HY84.
It lies
on top of a moderately steep knoll and slopes eastward, extending
to the edge of the tributary at the base of the hill.
It is 500
meters north of the point at which a pasture road crosses the
creek. The site measures 150 x 175 meters, extending from the
south to the west side of a limestone knob, through the oak woods
to the south then into a clearing running east-west. Cores and
flakes were observed at the site; workshop areas were apparently
nonexistent. One dart point was mapped in place on the alidade
map.
Work done by the survey: A single grid line was established
through the clear area with stakes set every 25 meters.
It was
oriented 30° north of east, running east-west. After surface
collecting the artifact samples, a plane table map and photographs
were made.
Recommendations:
In the absence of discrete concentrations
it is not suggested that this site be nominated to the National
Register of Historic Places.

7

Structure S-1
Two sites were recorded within the maximum detention pool
elevation of this damsite (840 feet ms!).
Lithic resource procurement locality 41HY93 was recommended for further work.
This
damsite will cross Sink Creek 4 miles west of San Marcos and 1
mile north of Ranch Road 12, crossing both the Scrutchin Ranch
property and the Freeman Ranch property.
Site 41HY93 lies entirely
on the Scrutchin property, 1/4 mile south of the ranch headquarters.
Site 41 HY 93
Description:
The site extends 50 x 150 meters through a
clearing 80 meters south of the creek.
It is characterized by
a thin scatter of debris and cores interspersed with unbroken
cobbles.
One dart point was collected and plotted on the alidade
map.
No workshop areas were found.
As the site lies well within
the detention pool elevation, it will be affected by construction
of the floodwater retarding structure.
Work done by the survey:
Surface collection of artifacts
along a north-south grid line at stakes placed every 25 meters,
compilation of a plane table map, and photographic documentation
were accomplished by the field crew.
Recommendations: The scatter is insufficient to warrant
further work.
Nomination to the National Register of Historic
Places is not suggested.

41HY74

Disrupted topsoil due to bulldozing has
seriously damaged information yield potential of this site. Flakes, cores and
bifaces were abundant.
It is not considered eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places.

41HY75

Areas A, B, and C of the site exhibit
discrete artifact concentrations. Flakes,
cores, bifaces, and dart points occurred
on all areas of the site. Variable concentrations of chert may provide evidence
of preferential selection of lithic material.
Stages in biface manufacture and
significant spatial relationships may be
reconstructable from the discrete concentrations. Dart points could provide time depth.
It is considered eligible
for nomination to the National Register
of Historic Places.

41HY76

A moderate scatter of debris covered the
site, containing cores, flakes, and a few
bifaces. No discrete concentrations were
noted. This site does not warrant nomination to the National Register of Historic
Places.

41HY84

Dart points, bifaces, cores, and flakes
were thinly distributed across the site.
One small area of quarried chert was present. No discrete artifact clusters were
found on the site. Nomination to the
National Register of Historic Places is
not warranted.

41HY86

Numerous discrete concentrations and artifacts were present on this site. A large
quantity of cores, bifaces, and dart points
give this site an extremely high information yield potential.
Stages of biface
manufacture and significant spatial patterning of discrete clusters is possible.
Nomination to the National Register of
Historic Places is warranted.

SUGGESTED PLAN OF MITIGATION

One archeological site each at floodwater retarding structures
S-3 Revised and S-3A warrant further investigations. The following
plan of mitigation is designed to utilize the outstanding qualities
of sites 41HY75 and 41HY86 in an attempt to suggest answers concerning the aboriginal selection and use of lithic resource procurement
localities.
Structure S-3 Revised, Site 41 HY 75
An intense program of mapping and controlled surface collecting should be undertaken at 41HY75. The boundaries of the site need
to be more accurately defined than was possible with the time
allotted during assessment field work. All discrete concentrations should be located and mapped in an effort to highlight
spatial relationships which may occur in the site. Areas A, B, and
C should be individually scrutinized and mapped to establish more
definite boundaries between the areas and to differentiate the
nature of lithic debris which occurs at each. Discrete flake
concentrations should be examined to identify predominant types
of flakes and to isolate stages of biface manufacture.

---------------------------

------- ------------ -

----- -

10

Artifacts should be located, plotted on plane table maps, and
collected to document any spatial significance that may exist
among the artifacts and to enhance the interpretation of discrete
clusters. A time range for use of the area may be established if
diagnostic artifacts are found.
Controlled surface collection was undertaken in the assessment
of this site. Lab time will need to be allotted for close examination of this material to accompany data derived from discrete
cluster and artifact mapping.
Examples of flaking techniques,
preferential selection of chert, and tools other than bifaces or
dart points should be closely examined in this collection.
The problem of preferential selection of chert on this site
is quite perplexing. Two primary questions should be examined in
the course of mitigation:
Is the finer quality chert widespread
at a certain elevation? Or, is it localized in the vicinity of
this lithic resource procurement locality? An inventory of the
naturally-occurring cherts on the site and on the gravels to the
east and west of the site will be necessary.
It remains unclear
why a great number of chert cobbles of adequate size and texture
occurring on Area A would be so wholly ignored in favor of the
slightly more fine-grained variety utilized on Areas B and C.
Ratios
of one type of cobble to another would have to be noted in defined
areas at several locations on and off the site.
Examples of the
predominant cherts should be collected for lab use to determine inherent differences in fissuring, grain quality, and knapping ability
which may exist and which possibly influenced selection.
One final question should be explored during work on this
site; no hammerst6nes or remains of anything resembling a flaking
implement were found.
The local limestones and cherts are unsu~table for use as hammerstones -- they are either too soft or
too brittle to withstand the repeated blows necessary to remove
cortex and/or flakes from rough cobbles~ Heavy use of the area
as the debris indicates -- suggests that a number of hammerstones
were utilized, but the remains or discards of these items have not
been found.
The lack of these tools suggests their importance and
also suggests that tool kits were transported to the site rather
than being collected from locally available materials.
Structure S-3A, Site 41 HY 86
A plan of mitigation for this site should emphasize the
surface collection of diagnostic artifacts and identification of
discrete lithic concentrations.
A number of definable discrete
areas exist on the site; these should be mapped and examined for
spatial placement and types of flaking debris. Location, mapplotting, and collection of artifacts would enable a time range

11

to be established and compared to that of 41HY75.
Spatial relationships may appear among the collected artifacts or in conj unction with discrete concentrations.
Hammerstones were not present; this suggests that, as at
41HY75, lithic tool manufacturing kits were transported to and
from the site, and were not collected from local materials.
Careful examination of the site for battered stones or fragments must
be undertaken here to determine the validity of this initial
observation.
Mapping will be necessary to define the boundaries of the
site more precisely than was done during assessment. The west
side of the site in particular requires more time to complete
contour elevations and the exact extent of the site.
The collection ·made during this assessment will require
lab time to properly scrutinize any materials which may show signs
of having been utilized as tools.
In conjunction with continued
mapping of artifacts and discrete areas, this collection should
reveal significant data in isolating recognizable stages of biface
manufacture. Any changes in manufacturin~ technology over time
might also be emphasized in this fashion.
