Abstract
Flatrock Engineering and Environmental, Ltd. of San Antonio, Texas contracted with Tierras
Antiguas Archaeological Investigations (TAAI) to conduct a cultural resources background
review of the 0.9-mile Dickinson F 4H Pipeline to be installed by Chesapeake Energy in northcentral McMullen County, Texas. Based upon the cultural resources background review that
identified an area of high potential for buried and intact archaeological deposits to exist, (TAAI)
then conducted a cultural resources field investigation of approximately 700 meters of the rightof-way. The project was entirely privately funded, and the properties across which the pipeline
will cross are privately owned; therefore, no Texas Antiquities Permit was required.
A 100-percent pedestrian survey with shovel testing along 700 meters of the right-of-way was
conducted by two archaeologists on May 11, 2011, resulting in no evidence of cultural material
observed either on, or below the surface. Therefore, Tierras Antiguas recommends that the
development of the Dickinson F 4H Pipeline be allowed to proceed as planned. However, Tierras
Antiguas further recommends that if any additional, undiscovered cultural resources are
encountered during development, such finds should be examined and evaluated by Tierras
Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant.

Acknowledgments
There are mainly four individuals who are greatly appreciated, and whose efforts contributed to
the successful planning, organization, and completion of this project. They are: Mr. David Black
Project Manager, and Ms. Judy Vader and Mr. Ryan Debarros, assistant Project Managers at
Flatrock Engineering and Environmental, Ltd; and, Permitting Specialist, Mr. Ronnie

Introduction
Flatrock Engineering and
Environmental, Ltd., requested a
cultural resources background review
of the proposed 0.9-mile Dickinson F
4H Pipeline right-of-way in central
McMullen County, to be installed by
Chesapeake Energy, and hereinafter
referred to as the Project Area (PA)
(Figures 1 - 4). Following the
background review, Flatrock then
requested a field cultural resources
survey of approximately 700 meters of
the right-of-way. Tierras Antiguas
Archaeological Investigations (TAAI)
conducted a 100-percent pedestrian
survey with shovel testing along that
portion of the right-of-way on May 11,
2011.

Dickinson F 4H Pipeline project in Texas.

Modern Environmental
Setting
Climate and Vegetation
McMullen County is located in southcentral Texas mid-way between the
Gulf of Mexico to the east, and the Rio
Grande to the west (see Figure 1). Its
current political boundary encompasses
1,159 square miles. The generally flat
to rolling terrain ranges in elevation
from about 150-450 feet above mean
sea level. Clayey and loamy soils
support the growth of small Figure 2. Location of the Dickinson F 4H Pipeline in
predominately mesquite trees, and central McMullen County.
thorny scrub brush with assorted cacti,
chaparrel, and grassy understory. With its semi-arid environment, the county is generally frostfree from mid-February through early December, allowing for a 290-day growing season. The
average annual rainfall is about 24 inches (Leffler 1996).

1

However, rainfall amounts vary
significantly from year to year, and the
high evapotranspiration effects in the
area effectively offset any beneficial
surplus of annual rainfall. This is
another reason irrigation systems are
so necessary, and commonly found in
use today throughout the area.
Summers are indeed hot and dry, with
temperatures consistently hovering
above 1000F, although humidity is
generally low compared to
environments closer to the Gulf Coast.
Overall, the county’s climate can be
classified as subtropical steppe.

Hydrology
The Nueces River and the Rio Grande
are the major southeasterly trending
rivers draining the South Texas region.
A subtle divide through the county
causes numerous intermittent creeks to
flow south into the Nueces River, and
others to drain toward the north, and
into the Frio River. Many drainages
intermittently flow into both rivers
during infrequent seasonal periods of
abundant rainfall. Although there are
many springs in McMullen County,
very few are active due primarily to the
dip of the substrate shales which carry
these subterranean seeps to the south
and east. Ancient springs that may
have existed in the area at one time
have likely succumbed to overgrazing
and irrigation pumping during modern
times (Brune 1981). During our
investigation of the project area in
April 2011, we observed no water
flowing, or niche pools.

Flora and Fauna
The project area lies within the South
Texas Plain/Brush Country vegetation
area as defined by Gould (1975), and
the regional flora of South Texas has
been classified as being part of the
Tamaulipan biotic province extending
out from northeast Mexico (Figures 5
and 6). This is the only part of Texas
where some vegetation exhibits growth
throughout the year (Blair 1950; Map
2011). Thorny brush is the dominant
vegetation today, but this is a relatively
recent occurrence, with a mix of woody
and grassland species providing a
savanna environment during prehistoric
times (Archer 1995; Black 1989;
Hester 1980; Inglis 1964). The original
vegetation was an open grassland
mixed with brushy chaparral. Oaks,
pecan, and ash were common along
perennial streams. Due in part to
overgrazing and the exclusion of fire, Figure 5. Physiographic regions of Texas
the invasion of woody species has (http://www.lib.utexas.edu/geo/pics/txphysio.jpg)
changed the vegetation into “Texas
brush country” dominated by mesquite,
acacia, spiny hackberry, brazil,
whitebrush, lotebrush, and others
(Diamond et al. 1987:203-221). On
sandy soils, the brush includes
mesquite with mixed grasses. In
contrast, clay soils support mesquite
(Proposis juliflora), various species of
Acacia, and mimosa, granjeno or desert
hackberry (Celtis pallida), lignum vitae
(Porliera angustifolia), cenizo
(Leucophyllum texanum), white brush
(Aloysia texana), prickly pear (Opuntia
lindheeimeri), tasajillo (Opuntia
leptocaulis), and species of Condalia
and Castela (Blair 1950).
The South Texas Plains/Brush Country
exhibits some of the greatest

mammalian species diversity in
the state. Sixty-one species of
mammals, 36 snakes, 19 lizards,
and several species of turtles,
salamanders, and frogs are
present in the region (Blair
1950). Approximately 50
species of fish have been
identified in the lower Rio
Grande (Lee et al. 1980).

Paleoenvironment
The paleoenvironment of south
Texas is as varied as the
landscape, and the South Texas
Paleoclimatic record contains
significant gaps primarily due to
the scarcity of deep, finely
stratified, and well-dated
deposits (Stahle and Cleaveland
1995:51). To date, the best
record of paleoenvironmental
reconstruction in South Texas
has been accomplished by
Robinson (1982) from analysis
of phytoliths from three
archaeological sites in Live Oak
County. Overall, the data there
along with data from other sites
in Texas suggest that the waning
of the Pleistocene, or late-glacial
period, marked a transition from
a cooler, wetter environment to
one that steadily grew warmer
and drier, and more seasonal,
with intermittent moist periods
through about 6,000 years ago.
Most researchers then generally
agree that the period between Figure 7. South Texas Archaeological region cultural
6,000 and 3,000 years ago was chronology.
much warmer and drier than
4

today. Since that time, intermittent moist and dry intervals have occurred over the past 3,000
years.
It is unlikely that the climate has changed significantly in the past few thousand years in the area
that would significantly induce vegetation changes. The greater changes have been induced by
human intervention through the clearing of wooded areas along the river and streams for
construction purposes, pumping more water for irrigation which has lowered water tables, and
overgrazing by livestock. Although there are still many seeps, springs, and streams in the area,
they most probably flowed with greater abundance during wetter intervals than exist at the
present time, providing an abundant resource for prehistoric occupants.

Cultural Chronology
The Dickinson F 4H project lies within the South Texas Archaeological region as defined by
Hester (1980, 1995, 2004; Figure 7). Refining a cultural chronology for south Texas is
problematic, due to the compressed nature of the archaeological record and the scarcity of
stratified sites excavated within the region. Hester (1995:433) acknowledges the paucity of
information that exists for south Texas and as such offers only a “general framework” for
prehistoric periods particular to the region (Figure 6). All dates are given as approximate years
before present (B.P.), i.e., before 1950.

Paleoindian (11,200 - 7950 B.P.)
This period is estimated at between ca.11,200–7950 B.P. in south Texas (Hester 1999). The
Paleoindian period began toward the close of the Pleistocene. Diagnostic artifacts of the early
Paleoindian interval include Clovis and Folsom projectile points. The wide distribution of
Clovis-type points across most of North America and even into Central America suggests a wide
dispersal and interaction of the people who made them. Other artifacts associated with the Clovis
culture include bifaces and prismatic blades, engraved stones, bone and ivory points, stone bolas,
ochre, and shaft straighteners. During the late Paleoindian interval, the first stemmed lanceolate
points, such as Angostura, Golondrina, St. Mary’s Hall, and Barber (among a few others) appear.

In general, the Paleoindian adaptation has been considered to be one of small bands of nomadic,
big-game hunters following herds of Late Pleistocene fauna, including mammoth, mastodons,
bison, camel, and horse, across North America (Black 1989). More recently, emphasis has been
placed on the wide diversity of plants and animals used for subsistence by these early Americans,
such as turtles and tortoises, alligators, mice, badgers, and raccoons, although they undoubtedly
hunted the large animals as well (Collins 1995:381). Known Clovis sites include killsites,
quarries, caches, open campsites, ritual sites, and burials (Hester 1995:433–436). A Folsom
interval follows the Clovis. Folsom artifacts are fairly common in south Texas; however, no
camp sites or killsites have been found south of a large workshop, Pavo Real (41BX52), in Bexar
County (Hester 1995:434–435). Most Paleoindian finds in south Texas have consisted of surface
5

lithic scatters on upland terraces and ridges (Black 1989).
As the warming that marks the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene climates began to take
effect in Texas, prehistoric inhabitants adapted with changes in lifestyle. This climatic shift is
also marked by the decline and extinction of mammoth, mastodon, horse, camel, and giant bison
(Bison antiquus). Large gregarious game animals were perhaps extinct in Texas. Human hunters
were forced to concentrate on deer, antelope, and other medium-size or smaller game. Changes
in the subsistence base required technological shifts that mark the beginning of a new cultural
period known as the Archaic.
Early Archaic (7950 - 4450 B.P.)
Hester (1995:436–438) identifies the Early Archaic, with Early Corner Notched and Early Basal
Notched dart points, as roughly dating between 7950 to 4450 B.P. The extinction of large herds
of megafauna and the changing climate at the beginning of the Holocene stimulated a behavioral
change by the Prehistoric inhabitants of south Texas (McKinney 1981). While the basic huntergatherer adaptation probably remained intact, an economic shift away from big game hunting
was necessary. In general, more intensive exploitation of local and smaller resources such as
deer, fish, and plant bulbs is indicated by greater densities of ground-stone artifacts, fire-cracked
rock cooking features, and more specialized tools. Weir (1976) speculates that Early Archaic
groups were small and highly mobile, an inference based on the fact that Early Archaic sites are
thinly distributed and that diagnostic projectile point types are seen across a wide area, including
most of Texas and northern Mexico. Story (1985) believes that population densities were low
during the Early Archaic, and that groups consisted of related individuals in small bands with
“few constraints on their mobility” (Story 1985:39). Their economy was based on the utilization
of a wide range of resources, especially such year-round resources as prickly pear and lechugilla,
as well as rodents, rabbits, and deer.
Middle Archaic (4450 - 2350 B.P.)
Hester (1995:438–441) suggests that the period between 4450 and 2350 B.P. reflects the Middle
Archaic in south Texas. The Middle Archaic appears to have been a time of increased
population, based on the large number of sites from this period (Story 1985:40; Weir 1976:125,
128). On the South Texas Plains, exploitation of widely scattered, year-round resources such as
prickly pear continued (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13–15), as did hunting deer and rabbit.
Weir (1976) believes that the widely scattered bands prevalent in the Early Archaic now began
to coalesce, at least during the acorn-gathering season, into larger groups who shared the
intensive work of gathering and processing the acorn harvest (Weir 1976:126). Many researchers
believe burned rock middens are a result of this endeavor (Creel 1986; Prewitt 1991; Weir 1976).
The common presence of deer remains in burned rock middens encourages the view that deer
processing took place at burned rock midden sites. Bison bone is encountered in archaeological
sites in south Texas, at least occasionally, during all but the earliest part of the Middle Archaic
(Dillehay 1974). Cemeteries make their first appearance during this period, suggesting a
movement toward less mobility and perhaps territorialism. One of the earliest occurrences dating
to the south Texas Middle Archaic, is Loma Sandia in Live Oak County, which dates between
ca. 2550 and 2750 B.P. (Taylor and Highley 1995).
6

Late Archaic (2350 - 1250 B.P.)
Hester believes the Late Archaic in south Texas may be defined as between 2350–1250 B.P,
Some researchers believe populations increased throughout the Late Archaic (Prewitt 1985),
while others feel populations remained the same or fell during this period (Black 1989:30).
Subsistence is assumed to have become less specialized on acorns, in favor of a broad spectrum
subsistence base (Black 1989:30). Story (1985:44–45) believes the presence of cemeteries
indicates that Late Archaic populations in central and south Texas were increasing and becoming
more territorial. Although inhabitants of the South Texas Plain near Brownsville and Rockport
had begun to make pottery by about 1750 B.P., the northern part of the plain was still “preceramic” until 1,000 years later (Story 1985:45–47). Late Archaic points tend to be much smaller
than Middle Archaic points.
Transitional Archaic (2250 - 1250 B.P.)
A late subperiod or interval of the Late Archaic is frequently referred to as the Terminal Archaic
or Transitional Archaic. Turner and Hester (1993) cite data placing the Transitional Archaic as
2250–1250 B.P. Although Hester may lump current data into a Late Archaic period, he cautions
that more evidence will likely result in what may be termed as a “Terminal Archaic” period
during the latter part of the Late Archaic in south Texas. This Terminal Archaic period is
represented by diagnostics such as Ensor, Frio, and Matamoras points which appear to overlap
the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods (Hester 1995:442). Weir (1976) believes this
marked a transition period to localized area sites, a disappearance of burned rock middens and
bison, and a reappearance of highly mobile hunters and gatherers. Others (Black and McGraw
1985; Peter 1982; Skelton 1977) argue that in some locations burned rock middens did not
disappear and sites were more intensely occupied during the Transitional Archaic period.

Late Prehistoric (1250 - 420 B.P.)
The term “Late Prehistoric” is commonly used to designate the period following the Late Archaic
in south Texas. Generally, the Late Prehistoric period is thought of as spanning the period
between A. D. 700 - 1530 ([1250 - 420 B.P.] [Hester 1995]). A series of distinctive traits mark
the shift from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric period, including the technological shift to the
bow and arrow and the introduction of pottery to central Texas and the northern South Texas
Plain (Black 1989:32; Story 1985:45–47). Two distinct phases recognized within the Late
Prehistoric are the Austin and Toyah. During the Austin phase, there appears to be a subtle
transition from expanding stem projectile points that may have been used as dart points, as well
as early arrow points. The most prevalent point found in Austin phase sites is the Scallorn arrow
point. Settlement shifts into rockshelters such as Scorpion Cave in Medina County (Highley et
al. 1978) and Classen Rockshelter in northern Bexar County (Fox and Fox 1967) have been
noted. Cemeteries from this period often reveal evidence of conflict (Black 1989:32).
Beginning rather abruptly at about 650 B.P., a shift in technology occurred. The Perdiz arrow
point may best represent the appearance of a distinct culture in south-central Texas lasting for
about 300 years, which archaeologists have labeled the Toyah phase. Hester (1995:444)
7

recognizes this phase as the “best documented Late Prehistoric pattern” throughout south Texas,
with dates ranging between ca. 650/700 to 300/350 B.P. (A.D. 1250/1300 to 1600/1650).
In addition to Perdiz points, evidence of a Toyah culture is manifested as bone-tempered pottery,
bone spatulates, awls, and beads, stone endscrapers, beveled knives, and expediently utilized
flakes. Briefly, expedient lithic technology involves removing flakes from a core in a
nonstandard manner; the purpose is to knock off sharp flakes for immediate use, selecting the
ones that best suit the need at the time. This technology differs from formal, standardized core
reduction and the manufacturing of formal, usually bifacial tools. Expedient lithic technology
is a continent-wide phenomonon indicative of increased sedentism, and is observed in Toyah
assemblages in Texas.
Whether the Toyah phase seen in the south-central Texas archaeological record is a result of a
group of people moving into the region, or adapted technologies from the region’s periphery is
a matter of conjecture. Steele and Assad-Hunter (1986) argue for the occurrence of a distinct
change in diet between the Late Archaic and the Late Prehistoric components in two sites in the
Choke Canyon Reservoir area in south Texas. Analysis of the number of identified specimens
(NISP) shows a marked increase in artiodactyla elements present during the later part of the Late
Prehistoric, an increase largely due to the addition of bison to the “menu” (Steele and AssadHunter 1986:468).
Whether or not agriculture was practiced during this period in south Texas has not been
documented. There simply is not enough evidence to postulate there was ever a significant
presence of maize in the area. The later arrival of the Spanish during the later
Protohistoric/Historic period brought significant cultivars to south Texas.
Protohistoric/Historic (420 B.P. - present)
The end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic period in south Texas is
characterized by written accounts of European contact with indigenous groups. The Protohistoric
period begins in 1528 when Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca traversed parts of southeast and
south Texas and left a diary of his five years spent traveling among the hunter-gatherers of Texas
and northern Mexico (e.g., Hallenbeck 1971). Cabeza de Vaca’s account of his stay with the
Miriami in 1533-34 indicates that groups of Native Americans would normally tether themselves
to the easily exploitable riverine environments in the fall, winter and summer, occasionally
sending a hunting party onto the grasslands to hunt deer. In the summer, many groups would live
near each other in the semiarid environs of South Texas to harvest prickly pear pads and other
succulents (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13-37).
Linguistically, early protohistoric accounts of the late 1500s indicate that a large group which
spoke Cohuilteco inhabited the area now known as south-central Texas. Coahuiltecan is a term
coined by Mexican linguists in the 1800s, and the name refers to the many small bands of Native
Americans who lived in northeastern Coahuila, Mexico and south Texas. The Coahuiltecans
were rapidly dispersed or killed during the Protohistoric period.

8

By the 1540s and 1550s Spanish ranchers had established large ranches in northern Mexico, with
several hundred thousand cattle, using Indian slaves as labor. Large mining ventures in northern
Mexico did the same. This encroachment from the south forced Native Americans to escape into
the south-central Texas region.
The period between de Vaca’s written account and the advent of Spanish missions in the late
1600s and early 1700s is referred to as the Protohistoric; a time when few, scant written
documents exist detailing Native American life outside the missions. The Historic period then,
is generally thought of as beginning in the 1700s.
Some 30 miles south of Eagle Pass, the Spanish established Mission San Juan Bautista in 1700
(now modern-day Guerrero). Early Spanish explorers then repeatedly traveled the Camino Real
enroute to newly established missions and settlements in today’s modern Texas throughout the
1700s and 1800s. Mexican families from across the river expanded into Texas, and these families
trace their roots to the early development of the area. In the ensuing years, lawlessness prevailed,
with saloons, gambling houses, outlaws, and slave hunters prevalent.

McMullen County Prehistory and History
Indian artifacts found in McMullen County indicate that the area has been occupied for about
11,000 years. Plentiful food sources such as wild game, fruits, seeds, and roots made the land
hospitable. Early technology included tools from wood and stone, woven basketry, sewed
rabbitskin robes, and a very effective weapon was the atlatl, a throwing stick that greatly
increased the deadliness of their spears (Leffler 1996). Perhaps as early as 1,300 years ago, they
learned to make pottery and to hunt with bows and arrows. During the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries, the Coahuiltecan Indians native to McMullen County were squeezed out
by other Indian who were migrating into the area and by the Spanish, who were moving up from
the south. Many of the Coahuiltecans were taken to San Juan Bautista in Coahuila. Apaches and
Comanches moved in to take their place (Leffler 1996).
“In the earliest of written accounts, no permanent Spanish settlements seem to have been
established in the area now known as McMullen County. In 1828, the land was assigned to John
McMullen and James McGloin, who contracted to settle the area with 200 Catholic immigrants.
By 1835 the Mexican government had issued perhaps fifteen grants of land in the area of present
McMullen County to colonists associated with the McMullen-McGloin project. None of these
grantees actually settled on the land assigned to them, however. By 1836, when Texas seceded
from Mexico, the area remained populated almost entirely by the Indian bands that roamed
through the area.
When William Bollaert, an English land speculator, traveled through the area between the
Nueces and Frio rivers in 1844, for example, the only people he encountered were convicts who
had escaped from a prison in Laredo. Even after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo definitively
assigned the Nueces Strip to Texas, outlaws and unfriendly Indians delayed development of the
9

area for years. By 1860, there were perhaps 100 settlers in the county. By the late 1860s and
early 1870s, a number of ranches had been established, mostly in the northern part of the county.
For protection, ranchers often grouped their dwellings together” (Leffler 2011).

Results of A Cultural Resources Background Review
The research by TAAI included:
1) A review of the most current literature documenting the prehistory and history of the
immediate area
2) A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas to identify
what cultural resource surveys have been conducted, and what archaeological sites have been
documented within one mile of the project area
3) A search of various websites that offer old maps of the PA
4) A literature review of both published and unpublished reports and manuscripts that describe
the types of archaeological sites that have been documented, and thus provide insight as to the
types of sites that may be expected either in the PA, or immediately adjacent to it
5) A review of a local soils map in order to evaluate the potential for intact and buried cultural
materials either within or immediately adjacent to the PA.

Archaeological Atlas Site Results
A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Atlas of Texas Archaeological sites indicated
that no documented cultural resources surveys had been conducted within one mile of the PA,
nor had any archaeological sites been documented within one mile of the PA (Atlas 2011). The
PA lies to the northwest of a large archaeological survey conducted in anticipation of the
construction of the Choke Canyon Reservoir (e.g, Hall et al. 1981). During that survey conducted
in the 1980s, 116 prehistoric archaeological sites located in both Live Oak and McMullen
counties were documented, ranging in age from 350 years ago to 11,000 years ago. Through all
the periods of Choke Canyon's history, humans subsisted by hunting and gathering natural food
resources available in the area. Many of the prehistoric sites are situated on terrace deposits,
ridges, and ridge promontories overlooking streams in the upper reaches of second and third low
order tributaries.
In addition, archaeologists from the Center for Archaeological Research at the University of
Texas at San Antonio conducted archaeological investigations at eight historic sites at Choke
Canyon Reservoir. A number of different types of structures were investigated, the purpose
being to extract as much information as possible about architecture, lifestyles, and settlement
patterns during the last half of the 19th century within the reservoir. Artifacts recovered helped
10

recreate the life of the people, demonstrating how they met the challenges of living in a frontier
area, and how life changed after the Civil War and the coming of law and order, railroads, and
modern communications (Fox and Ward 1986).

Prehistoric Site Potential
Without written or oral accounts before the 1700s, it is difficult or impossible to truly say what
bands or tribes were within the modern political boundaries of McMullen county before then.
Only cultural affiliations can be assigned to those groups, equating their technologies and
apparent lifestyles to the successive Paleo-Indian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric periods.
Archaeologists have documented an assundry of prehistoric archaeological sites, including large
open campsites that are most commonly located along stream or river terraces with numerous
campfires, where a wide variety of stone tools, grinding stones, pottery sherds, and butchered
animal remains are found. Where gravels outcrop, either along eroded streambeds, or on higher
terrain where more ancient gravels are sometimes exposed in isolated pockets, one can expect
stone chipping stations, or prehistoric quarries.

Historic Site Potential
The earliest historic accounts of Native Americans in south Texas and perhaps the McMullen
county areas, are those of Cabeza de Vaca. In the 1500s, Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca
traversed parts of southeast and south Texas and left a diary of his five years spent traveling
among the hunter-gatherers of Texas and northern Mexico (e.g., Covey 1961). His account of
his experiences in 1533–34 indicates that groups of Native Americans would normally tether
themselves to the easily exploitable riverine environments in the fall, winter, and summer,
occasionally sending a hunting party onto the grasslands to hunt deer. In the summer, many
groups would live near each other in the semiarid environs of south Texas to harvest prickly pear
pads and other succulents (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13–37).
By the 1540s and 1550s, Spanish ranchers had established large ranches in northern Mexico with
thousands of cattle, and using Native Americans as slave labor. This encroachment by the
Spanish forced groups from northern Mexico to flee into south Texas. In the 1700s and 1800s,
there are documented accounts of Spanish entradas passing through the area, but none have been
noted to establish any sort of permanent bases in present-day Mc Mullen county (Chipman
1992).
It was not until about 1865, that the surrounding frontier hinterlands that are now politically
known as Mc Mullen county were considered safe enough for white settlers to begin establishing
smaller ranches and farmlands without complete annihilation by the many roving bands of angry
Comanche raiders from the north, as well as other displaced Native American groups (Leffler
1996). In sum, there may be rare and isolated occurrences of early ranching activities along the
Dickenson F 4H Pipeline, but the expectations of encountering any archaeological site of
significance from the 1500s through the mid-1900s along the line were minimal.

Old Maps and Aerial Photographs Research

A standard source of review is the extensive collection of online maps and aerial photographs
available at the Perry Castañada Library at the University of Texas at Austin (Perry Castañeda
Library 2011). The only old map found here was a 1925 State of Texas Board of Water
Engineers topographic map. No historic development was mapped at that time in the way of the
proposed Dickinson F 4H Pipeline.
A second standard research source consulted for old maps and aerial photographs was a very
comprehensive and large compilation of old maps and aerial photographs compiled by the Texas
Department of Transportation from dozens of historic archives throughout the state of Texas.
Once again, the Dickinson F 4H Pipeline route appears to be in a rural area of McMullen County
that either warranted little attention, or the area was void of historic structures.
Nevertheless, the lack of comprehensive historic map and aerial information, coupled with the
paucity of cultural resources surveys within the area is possibly, and perhaps probably, why no
information is available regarding the presence of historic structures, ranching or industrial
activities, or persons of historic significance to the immediate area. These maps are not exact by
today’s standards, and it is possible that historic water tanks, corrals, outbuildings other
structures related to early ranching activities could be encountered along the Dickinson F 4H
Pipeline.
Technically, any structures old than 45 years are now considered of interest by the Texas
Historical Commission, and this should be considered when the pipeline right-of-way is
excavated. Historic sites recorded in McMullen County consist of local family cemeteries with
just a few burials in each, house sites and farmsteads from as early as the 1850s, and trash
scatters.

Soils Maps
As illustrated in Figure 8, there are five soil types along the pipeline route. These soils types are
consistent with the varying terrain in the central portion of McMullen County, and as such, the
potential for buried and intact cultural resources varies with the terrain and soils (Web Soil
Survey 2011). Table 1 provides a brief description of the soil types, and their potential for buried
deposits, and thereby implying their potential prehistoric significance.
The soils along the Dickinson F 4H suggest at best a moderate probability for buried and intact
archaeological deposits to exist, and it is unlikely that significant sites are extant in the upland
areas. However, soils along streams are more likely to contain intact archaeological deposits.

Field Survey Goals,
Methodology, and Levels of
Effort
Goals
The project goals focused on
archaeological issues that could be
addressed by the types of data obtained
through pedestrian survey, along with
limited shovel testing. The topics
addressed were site type, distribution,
density, size, depth, and stratigraphy.
The theoretical framework is structured
around patterns of settlement, mobility,
subsistence, and social systems for the
South Texas region.
The goals of the project were to:

quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy; and,

3)

place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.

Methods and Levels of Effort
Two archaeologists conducted an
intensive pedestrian survey of
approximately 700 meters of the 0.9mile right-of-way (ROW), meandering
back and forth across the 100-foot wide
corridor. Surface visibility ranged from
50 to 100 percent, and all cutbanks, and
rodent and mammal backdirt piles were
thoroughly examined. (Note: In
addition, at the time of the survey, we
observed survey stakes heading in a
southwesterly direction from the
Dickinson F 4H well pad. While there,
we examined that route also; see Figure
9).
Six shovel tests were dug along the
700-meter portion of the right-of-way
(Figure 9). Shovel tests were dug in 20cm levels, and all sediments were
screened through 1/4-inch wire mesh.
Following our designed research plan,
any artifacts recovered from shovel
tests were not to be collected, but were Figure 9. Location of shovel tests and surface areas

backfilled shovel test. The results of
shovel testing were fully documented on Shovel Test forms, are on file at the Tierras Antiguas
Archaeological Investigations office in Martindale, Texas, and may be made available upon
request.

Results of the Field Investigations
Surface Examination and Shovel Testing
During the survey it became readily apparent that much of the right-of-way examined was
eroded, and deflated. Sparse to dense vegetation along the right-of-way examined consisted of
small mesquite trees, shrubs, mesquite brush, and native grasses, with vegetation increasing in
density in close proximity to the stream channels (Figure 10). No evidence of cultural material
was observed beneath the surface within any of the six shovel tests, or eroding from the shallow
exposed cutbanks.

Survey Summary,
Conclusions, and
Recommendations
A background review of the proposed
0.9-mile Dickinson F 4H Pipeline
indicated that there were very selected
areas which suggested a moderate to
high probability for deeply buried,
stratified, and intact prehistoric cultural
deposits to be extant. A 100-percent
pedestrian survey with shovel testing
along those portions was conducted by
two archaeologists on May 11, 2011. Figure 10. Ephemeral stream bottom of a tributary of

buried within any of the few cutbanks
available for examination. As such, Tierras Antiguas recommends that the development of the
Dickinson F 4H Pipeline be allowed to proceed as planned. However, Tierras Antiguas further
recommends that if any additional, undiscovered cultural resources are encountered during
development, such finds should be examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any
qualified archaeological consultant.
