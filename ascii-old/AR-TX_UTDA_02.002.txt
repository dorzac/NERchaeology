Introduction
The Harroun Site (University of Texas Site No. 41UR10), in the
extreme northeastern corner of Upshur County, Texas, is one of several
sites excavated in the Ferrell's Bridge Reservoir area as a part of the
Inter-Agency Archeological Salvage Project. The site, which consisted
of four small mounds on the south floodplain of Cypress Creek, was
located and recorded by E. Mott Davis and Bernard Golden in October, 1957. It promised to produce valuable archeological data, and since
it was scheduled to be completely submerged by Ferrell's Bridge Reservoir in the summer of 1959, immediate steps were taken to provide for
salvage excavations prior to its inundation.
In December, 1957, a National Park Service field party excavated the
smallest of the four mounds, Mound A. A single extended burial containing two pottery vessels and an arrow point, was found in a shallow
grave beneath the mound. It appeared that Mound A had been erected
for the purpose of covering the burial. While Mound A was being excavated, the entire site was mapped, several trenches and test pits were
dug in the floodplain of Cypress Creek near Mound A, and some of the
trees and bushes were cleared from the other three mounds.
In September, 1958, under terms of a co-operative agreement between The University of Texas and the National Park Service, a crew
of the Texas Archeological Salvage Project returned to Harroun to
complete the investigation of the site. Because of time limitations it was
apparent that all three of the remaining mounds ( B, C, and D) could
not be entirely excavated. Therefore, it was decided to concentrate on
Mound C since it appeared superficially to be the least disturbed of the
three. After excavation of Mound C was well under way, a portion of
the crew was moved to Mound B and it was also opened. Both mounds
were found to contain burned remains of house structures.
Investigation of Mound D was begun late in September a few days

before the termination of the dig. Time did not permit complete excavation of Mound D that season, but it was tested sufficiently to reveal
that it-like Mounds B and C-contained the burned remains of at least
one house.
During the 1958 season, in addition to the work at Mounds B, C, and
D, several trenches and test pits were dug in the floodplain near the
mounds in a fruitless search for additional occupational features.
A final trip was made to the site in February, 1959, by L. F. Duffield,
W. A. Davis, and E. Mott Davis of the Texas Archeological Salvage
Project. They spent three days exposing and recording the portion of
the house at Mound D which had been left unexcavated the previous
fall.
As a result of the investigations at the Harroun Site in 1957, 1958, and
1959, all four of the mounds were completely excavated except for certain marginal portions and several check blocks. In addition, the area
surrounding the mounds was tested sufficiently to show that there
was no general area of occupation near the mounds. The excavation of
the Harroun Site was supervised by the senior author. The junior author
served as an rassistant archeologist during both the 1957 and 1958
seasons.
The artifacts recovered indicate affiliation with the Fulton Aspect of
the Caddoan Area ( Suhm et al., 1954: 151-161). The Fulton Aspect is
the later of two aspects that have been recognized in the Caddoan
Area as belonging to the agricultural, ceramic Mississippi culture pattern of the Southeastern United States.
To the Corps of Engineers, whose personnel at Ferrell's Bridge extended many courtesies and co-operated with the archeological field
parties in every possible way, we express our sincere gratitude. Special
acknowledgment is due Dr. E. Mott Davis and Dr. J. F. Epstein, staff
archeologists of The University of Texas, who visited the site while the
dig was in progress, and who not only aided the progress of the excavations by flexing their muscles over shovels and wheelbarrows, but also
offered much valuable advice toward solving the technical problems
encountered in the field. Their prowess with their guitars contributed
greatly to the conviviality of the field camp in the evenings. ·
A word of thanks and appreciation is due the shovel hands who
worked at the Harroun Site in 1957, 1958, and 1959. All extended themselves beyond normal expectation in order to accomplish a maximum

3

amount of work in the limited time available. They are John B. Johnson,
Robert L. Brockman, Thomas V. Loveday, W. Brent Hempkins, Floyd
W. Sharrock, Andrue Moore, A. C. Harvey, and \V. C. Jones. \Ve wish
also to thank Mr. Sam Whiteside of Tyler, Texas, a frequent visitor to
the site who spent many hours on the dig as a volunteer shovel hand.
Especially to· be commended are the assistant archeologists, John
Allen Graham, L. F. Duffield, W. A. Davis, and LeRoy Johnson, Jr.,
all of whom carried out their duties in exemplary fashion despite the
continuous pressure under which they were working.

The Site
ENVIRONMENT
Ferrell's Bridge Reservoir is located in the northwestern part of the
Gulf Coastal Plain ( Fenneman, 1938: 109-110), which is characterized
topographically by rounded hills sculptured from the superficial clays
and sands of the region. The subsoil-a sandy clay in various shades of
yellow, orange, and red-is capped by a thin mantle of gray sand which
evidently derived by differential erosion from the sandy clay. The exposed geological formations recognized in the general region are clays
and sands of the Eocene Claiborne group (Sellards et al., 1958: 606666 ).
The reservoir is situated in the Austroriparian Biotic Province (Blair,
1950: 93-117). The uplands are thickly timbered, principally with
pines, while the stream valleys sustain heavy stands of mixed hardwoods (oaks, cypress, gum, walnut, hickory, holly, and others) in addition to some pines. All the virgin forests were completely timbered out
years ago. Bear and panther, which were formerly common, have long
since disappeared from the area, but a large population of deer, raccoon, opossum, fox, rabbit, beaver, and other small mammals survives to
the present day. The streams abound with several varieties of fish.
The climate is relatively humid, the annual rainfall at the Gilmer station averaging 43.5 inches (U.S. Dept. of Commerce, Climatological
Data, Texas, V. 63, No. 13: 361). The mean annual temperature for
Upshur County is 65 degrees (Ibid.: 357).
SITE DESCRIPTION
The Harroun Site was situated on the south floodplain of Cypress
Creek on the outside of a large bend (Fig. 1). The only occupational
features visible on the surface were four small mounds, round to slightly

5

oval in shape, with rounded tops. They were designated Mounds A, B,
C, and D. A long, narrow lake, evidently surviving from an old cut-off
channel of Cypress Creek, lay beside the creek channel in the northwestern part of the site.
Mound A, located 75 feet south of the creek and 350 feet east of the
lake, was by far the smallest of the four mounds. It measured about 30
feet in diameter and rose to a maximum height of approximately two
feet above the surface of the floodplain. Mound B stood at the south end
of the lake, Mound C was on the west bank of the lake, and Mound D
was situated in a precarious position on the brink of the floodplain at
the creek channel, 150 feet downstream from Mound A. A shallow depression beside Mound C and two small depressions by Mound B
marked possible borrow areas. Mounds B, C, and D were all approximately the same size, about 50 feet in diameter and 2.5 to 3.5 feet high.
The floodplain of Cypress Creek in the vicinity of the Harroun Site
was overgrown with an almost impenetrable tangle of underbrush and
second growth timber. Old-timers, however, reported that many years
ago, before the virgin timber was cut, the stream valleys in this region
supported a tall growth of timber with virtually no underbrush.
GEOLOGICAL CONTEXT
The geology at the Harroun Site may be summarized in tabular form
as follows:
Zone IL A stratum of sand forming the surface of the floodplain, varying
from about 5 to 12 feet thick. Zone II was divided into three
parts, Ila, Ilb, and Ile.
Zone Ile. Humus-stained topsoil, the superficial portion of the Zone II
sand member, 0.6 to 1.1 feet thick.
Zone Ilb. Grayish to whitish sand with irregular-shaped patches of
brownish sand. The brown patches probably represent subsurface staining of the gray-white sands by iron salts carried
by percolating water. Zone Ilb was 2.0 to 3.1 feet thick
where exposed.
Zone Ila. Grayish to whitish sand similar to Ilb, but without the patches
of brown sand. This zone was heavily saturated with subsurface water wherever encountered, and the pres'ence of the
water may have kept the iron salts in solution, thereby explaining the absence of the stains. The thickness of Zone Ila
was not determined since seeping ground water prevented
excavating down to its base.

6

Zone I. A reddish clay member observed in natural exposures along the
edge of the creek channel. The top of Zone I was undulating, and
it lay at a depth of approximately 5 to 12 feet below the surface
of the floodplain in the exposures examined. The thickness was
not determined, but was in excess of 10 feet. The top of Zone I
was not reached in any of the excavated squares because seeping
ground water prevented carrying the excavations deeper than 4
to 5 feet.

7

Excavation and Recording Methods
The same general procedure was followed in excavating each of the
four mounds at the Harroun Site. A stake was placed near the center of
the mound and a grid of 5-foot squares was established which tied in
with the centrally located stake. Then each quadrant of the mound was
excavated separately. Beginning at the top of the mound, an entire quadrant was taken down by regular vertical intervals, usually of 0.5 feet
each. The floor of the excavation was cleaned and examined after each
level was removed, and measured drawings were prepared to record
any zoning or occupational features that were observed in the excavation floor.
The four profiles radiating in the cardinal directions from the central
stake were always left intact until measured drawings had been prepared, and other profiles were recorded when deemed necessary. Strategically located check blocks were left at all the mounds, at least until
the structure of the mound was determined. In some cases the check
blocks were ultimately removed in order to completely expose a house
floor or other feature.
For vertical reference, the base stake at Mound A was assigned an
arbitrary elevation of 100.0 feet, and all vertical measurements for the
entire site were keyed to that stake. For horizontal control a separate
grid of 5-foot squares was established for each mound and the area
adjacent to it. While the use of a separate grid for each mound had some
disadvantages, this method was adopted for two main reasons: ( 1) so
that a key stake with co-ordinates in whole numbers could be located at
the center of each mound, and ( 2) to avoid the use of unwieldy 4-digit
numbers for co-ordinates. For each grid a base stake, set well away from
the mound, was assigned an arbitrary designation of 0-0, and all other
stakes of that grid were labeled with the co-ordinates measured from
the base stake in the cardinal directions (as Nl00-W50, N85-W80,

8

etc. ) . All the grids were oriented on magnetic north. The designation for
each 5-foot square was taken from the co-ordinates at its southeast
corner.
Because of the press of time it was impossible to screen all of the
excavated soil. Each structural component was spot screened, however,
in order to obtain a representative sample of artifacts and other material. Both 1/3-inch and 1/4-inch hardware cloth were used for screens.
All artifacts and other specimens were placed in paper bags, on which
were recorded the square, vertical interval, geological or structural zone
(wherever possible), associated features (if any), appropriate grid,
date, and any other pertinent data. For specimens found in situ the
exact vertical and horizontal position was also recorded to the nearest
I/10th foot.
In addition to work in the mounds themselves, several exploratory
trenches were dug in the immediate vicinity of Mounds A, C, and D.
In each case these tests were tied in to the grid for the appropriate
mound. Small tests were made with a post hole digger or a shovel over
the entire area between the mounds, and also for some distance beyond
the general mound area. These small tests were irregularly spaced from
10 to 100 feet apart. Recording the location of each of them would have
required the clearing of a vast amount of underbrush; consequently,
since they were all unproductive, only the general areas tested were
noted.
Measured drawings, descriptive notes, and photographs were made
of the mounds, the burial at Mound A, the house plans at Mounds B,
C, and D, and the other occupational features. General site notes were
also taken, and a daily log of activities was maintained.

Mound A
Mound A, the smallest of the four mounds, was situated 75 feet south
of Cypress Creek and 100 feet west of Mound D (Fig. 1). It was
roughly oval in shape with the long axis running due east and west
(Figs. 2 and 11). The length at the base was 35 feet; the basal 'width
was 28 feet. The maximum height above the modern floodplain was
approximately two feet. No potholes or other disturbances were evident
from the surface.

9

After several trees and bushes had been cleared away, the Mound A
area was staked on a grid of 5-foot squares. A stake near the base of
the mound on the south side was arbitrarily selected as the base or
0-0 stake, and the designations for the other stakes were determined by
measuring their distance from the base stake in terms of the cardinal
directions. The elevation of the ground surface at the 0-0 stake was assigned an arbitrary value of 100.0 feet, and all vertical measurements
for the entire site were keyed to that point.
As an initial test, most of the southwestern quadrant of the mound
was excavated to undisturbed sub-mound soil so that two radial profiles
were left standing, one running south, the other west, from the approximate center of the mound. Since time did not permit complete excavation of Mound A, the only squares excavated in the remaining three
quadrants were the three 5-foot squares cornering on the approximate
center point of the mound and square Nl0-E5 which was excavated in
order to expose Burial No. 1 (Fig. 2). Two additional 5-foot squares
( Nl5-W 40 and S25-EO) beyond the limits of the mound structure were
carried down several feet below the surface of the floodplain. Each of
the latter squares was aligned with one of the two major profiles radiating from the center of the mound. A I-foot wide check strip, running
east-west along the N20 line, was left standing.
All squares were dug in 0.5-foot levels. Those squares in the mound
structure were leveled successively on each 1/2-foot interval of the vertical reference system, while the two squares dug into the floodplain near
Mound A were dug by 0.5-foot levels measured from the surface of the
ground. All the soil from squares Nl5-W40 and S25-EO, and an estimated 50% of the excavated mound fill from other squares, was
screened through hardware cloth of 1/4-inch mesh. All digging was
done with shovels except for close work around Feature No. 1 and
Burial No. 1 where trowels were used.
In the mound, horizontal plans were drawn to scale at 0.5-foot intervals as the squares were leveled, all features, soil changes, and major
disturbances being recorded. Representative profiles were also drawn to
scale so as to provide a record of the mound structure and of the relationship of the mound to the floodplain on which it rested. ·
The major profiles, the burned area near the center of the mound
(Feature No. 1 ), and the sub-mound burial (Burial No. 1) were photographed in both color and black and white.

STRUCTURE OF MOUND A
The profiles revealed that the bulk of the mound fill comprised a
single structural member composed of dark gray, humus stained, sandy,
midden soil (Fig. 3). It reached a maximum height of 1.4 feet above
the surface of the surrounding floodplain and extended down to an
average depth of 1.4 feet below the floodplain surface. The fill of
Mound A contained many tiny fragments of mussel shell, bone, charcoal, and stone chips, as well as a few potsherds, projectile points, and
other artifacts. Some of the shell and bone fragments showed evidence
of burning. The mound fill was unquestionably derived from an occupational area containing an appreciable quantity of cultural detritus.
The top of soil Zone lib in the area surrounding the mound was, on
an average, about 0.7 feet below the surface of the floodplain. The bottom of the mound structure, however, extended to an average depth of
1.4 feet below the floodplain surface where it terminated within Zone
lib ( Fig. 3). Thus the surface of Zone lib immediately beneath the
mound formed a shallow, saucer-shaped depression which must have
resulted from digging away of the topsoil before the mound was
erected. This shallow pit (perhaps originally 1.0 to 1.5 feet deep) was
approximately the same size and shape as the base of the mound.
OCCUPATIONAL FEATURES
Besides the mound itself, two occupational features were found in the
Mound A area: ( 1) an area of burned soil within the mound fill ( Feature No. 1 ), and ( 2) a sub-mound burial (Burial No. 1). Each is described separately below.

Feature No. 1
This was an elongated area of heavily burned, sandy clay lying within
the matrix of the mound fill (Fig. 3). Since the northern end of Feature
No. 1 was not completely excavated, the exact dimensions were not determined; but the maximum length was evidently between 9 and 10
feet, while the maximum width was 4.3 feet. The long axis ran approximately north-south. Profiles revealed a lenticular cross section with a
pronounced thickened area near the mid-point of the east edge. Near
the center the burned zone was 0.5 feet thick; the thickened area near
the east edge reached a maximum thickness of 1.5 feet.

The surface of Feature No. 1 was burned to a conspicuous degree of
hardness and was sharply demarcated from the soft, unfired mound fill
which overlay it. Beneath the central portion, heat had produced a thin
zone of reddish sand which merged gradually with the underlying grayish sand of the mound fill.
Feature No. 1 was situated in the lower portion of the body of the
mound. It did not have the appearance of a carefully prepared hearth,
but the presence of clay in the burned soil suggests that an irregularshaped clay base had been laid down where the fire was to be built. It
appears that after a layer of sand about a foot thick had been piled up to
form the base of the mound, further work on the mound was temporarily interrupted, a crude hearth of sandy clay was prepared near the
center of the basal layer of sand, and a fire of considerable intensity was
kindled on it. The hardness of the burned, sandy clay of the hearth indicates that the fire was quite a hot one and that it must have burnedcontinuously or intermittently-for a period of many hours at least.
After an unknown interval of time the fire was extinguished and the construction of the mound was resumed and carried to completion. The
sharp definition of the hearth surface and the homogeneity of the
mound fill above and below the hearth indicate that no appreciable
time elapsed between the extinguishing of the fire and the addition of
the upper part of the mound fill: otherwise the surface of the hearth
should have shown evidence of weathering and the two different stages
of mound construction should have been visible in the profiles as separate zones.
Burial No. 1

Beneath the southeast quadrant of Mound A a single burial was found
(Fig. 12, A). The skeleton lay in extended, supine position, with the
head to the northeast and the feet to the southwest. Preservation of the
bones was poor, and several of them (including the left femur, most of
the arm and hand bones, the lumbar vertebrae, and the foot and ankle
bones) had been destroyed or displaced by gophers whose runs interlaced the entire burial area. As a result of this disturbance the original
position of the arms could not be determined.
Two pottery vessels-a carinated bowl and a bottle, both of the type
Ripley Engraved (Fig. 12, B-C )-had been placed beside the left hip
as burial offerings, and an arrow point of the Perdiz type (Fig. 15, 0),

lying near the outer side of the left knee, appeared also to have been
included intentionally with the burial.
The first evidence that a burial was present was the discovery of several foot and ankle bones in a rodent run in square NIO-EO. The burrow
was traced toward the north for several feet where the distal end of a
human tibia was exposed in the northeast corner of square NIO-EO.
Since it was apparent that the major portion of the burial lay in square
NI5-E5, that square was taken down. At 0.5-foot intervals the floor of
the square was scraped clean with trowels and carefully examined for
evidence of a grave outline. However, none was detected in the mound
fill.
The burial was finally exposed at a depth of 3.6 feet below the surface
of the mound, the floor of the grave lying at an average depth of 1.0
feet below the base of the mound. A vague area of discolored soil
(which contrasted faintly with the surrounding undisturbed Ilb sand)
marked the location of the lower portion of the grave. The edges of the
burial pit were quite indefinite, having been considerably disturbed by
roots and rodents, but its appearance-both in flat plan and in profilesuggested that a shallow grave about a foot deep and just large enough
to accommodate the body had been dug from the floor of the shallow
sub-mound pit, the body had been placed in the grave, and then earth
had been heaped over both the body and the shallow pit to form the
mound.
The skeletal remains from Burial No. I were examined by Dr. T. W.
McKern, Assistant Professor of Anthropology, The University of Texas.
He has kindly provided the following statement:
"The skeletal material from Burial No. I, Site 41 URIO, Upshur
County, Texas, consists of one skeleton in a state of poor preservation.
Not only are the bones highly fragmented but not one, including the
skull, has escaped the destructive teeth of rodents. The brain case is
complete but the entire face is missing. Only parts of the mandible are
present including both left and right molars (3rd not erupted) and a
lower left 2nd premolar. The lower left dentition is in situ. No single
bone in the postcranial skeleton is anatomically complete. Also, due to
the young age of the remains, most of the epiphyses are missing.
"So far as possible, metric and morphological observations were taken
and recorded. But because of the incomplete nature of these observations, they will not be reproduced here.

15

"The skeleton is that of a 14 year old male with a cranial index of 82
( brachycranic). Although the cranium is slightly distorted there is no
evidence of artificial deformation.
"For pathology, the teeth show very little wear which is consistent
with the observed age. One pronounced cavity was found on the mesiodisto-occlusal surface of the lower left 2nd molar.
"Because of the almost complete lack of knowledge concerning the
range of physical types for the prehistoric populations of Texas it is
impossible to associate this skeleton with any known Indian group on a
strictly morphological basis."
DISCUSSION
Mound A was erected on an alluvial terrace of Big Cypress Creek for
the purpose of covering a grave. Prior to cohstruction of the mound approximately a foot of humic topsoil was dug away from the surface of
the terrace at the selected spot. A shallow grave was then dug in the
excavated area, the body was placed in the grave along with two pottery vessels and an arrow point, and the mound was formed over the
grave. When the basal portion of the mound was in place, the work was
halted temporarily while a fire of considerable intensity was kindled on
the incompleted mound-perhaps for ritual purposes. After the fire had
been extinguished work on the mound was resumed and brought to
completion.
The presence of artifacts in the sub-mound Zone Ilb formation indicates that the surface of the terrace in the Mound A area had been
lightly occupied prior to construction of the mound. The fill of the
mound contained artifacts similar to those in the sub-mound formation,
but also contained burned bone scraps, mussel shells, and fragments of
charcoal in some quantity. This circumstance shows that the soil of
which the mound was built came from a more intensively occupied
area than any discovered in the terrace around or under the mound.
The source of the mound soil was not determined.

Mound B
This low, approximately circular mound was located on the floodplain
of Cypress Creek, about 125 feet south of the stream channel, at the
south end of the lake (Fig. 1). A shallow depression about eight feet
across lay just southwest of the mound, and a similar but smaller depression was recorded at the northeast edge of the mound. These features probably are borrow sources. An instrusive pothole, located near
the center of the mound, was three to four feet in diameter at the surface, but fortunately it proved to be quite shallow and damage to the
mound was slight. The maximum diameter of Mound B, measured
north-south, was 55 feet (Fig. 4), and the mound reached a maximum
height of 2.8 feet above the floodplain.
Mound B was staked for excavation with the usual grid of 5-foot
squares oriented on magnetic north. The base stake was 100 feet south
and 100 feet east of the approximate center of the mound. Excavation
was carried out by the quadrant method as previously described, the
southeast and northwest quadrants being excavated :6rst, the southwest
and northeast quadrants last. Each quadrant was taken down by 1/2foot levels which were keyed to the vertical reference datum. In addition to work in the mound itself, the area immediately south of the
mound was tested by means of trenches (Fig. 4). The trenches were
dug in 1/2-foot levels measured from the surface of the floodplain at
each square.
The excavating and recording methods used at Mound B were generally the same as described for Mound A.
STRUCTURE OF MOUND B
The excavations in Mound B revealed clearly its internal structure
(Fig. 3). An old soil surface, unmistakably defined by a dark humic
zone, underlay the entire mound at an average elevation of 99 feet, or

approximately the same elevation as the modern surface of the floodplain. This evidently represents the surface humic zone (Zone Ile) of
the floodplain at the time the mound was built. Yellow-brown sand
(Zone lib) extended below the buried humic zone to an undetermined
depth. Zones lib and Ile beneath the mound contained a few scattered
stone chips and an occasional artifact, but there were no concentrations
of cultural material.
Resting directly on the old floodplain surface was the basal structural
component of the mound, a rather compact, circular lens of dark brown
sand up to a foot or more thick and averaging about 17 feet in diameter.
This lens, which contained abundant charcoal, burned clay daub, bone,
shell, and a few artifacts, represented the floor level of a house, designated House No. 3. In and above the floor level were the remains of
several charred poles, presumably derived from the burned framework
of the house. A burned area approximately four feet in diameter in the
center of the lens proved to be the remains of a central fire hearth. It
was filled with complex lenses of various shades and textures. A large
post mold was found beneath the hearth in the approximate center of
the house.
Completely encircling the house outline was a poorly defined zone of
yellow-brown sand which lay directly on the buried surface of the floodplain and extended upward a foot or two where it gradually blended
into the upper component of the mound fill. This light-colored sand may
have been banked against the outside of the house while it was still
standing; or it may have resulted from uneven, subsurface staining by
charcoal and other organic material of that portion of the mound lying
directly above the house. In any event, it was virtually devoid of cultural material, only a very few stone chips, widely scattered, being
found in it.
A well defined humic zone, resulting from organic staining after the
mound was built, appeared at the surface of the mound. It averaged
about 0.5 feet in thickness.
Except for the clay in the hearth and in the house floor, the entire
mound was constructed of sandy soil like that of the surrounding floodplain, whence it undoubtedly was derived. The depressions on the northwest and southeast sides of the mound are probably the borrow sources
for the sandy soil. The clay could have easily been obtained from exposures in the cut banks at the edge of the creek channel.

OCCUPATIONAL FEATURES
Besides the two possible borrow pits mentioned above, the only occupational feature found at Mound B was House No. 3.

House No. 3
This house was erected on the surface of the floodplain before the
mound was built. The purpose of the mound apparently was to bury the
remains of the house after it had burned.
Beneath the house floor zone, which was described in the preceding
section, were found 59 post molds measuring from 0.25 to 1.3 feet in
diameter and extending from 0.3 to 2.5 feet below the floor (Fig. 5).
The faint gray stain of the post molds was quite dim and difficult to
distinguish. They were located by cutting a vertical face completely
around the house area, then carefully cutting the face inward from all
sides. As the post molds were located, they were plotted on a horizontal
plan and a measured profile drawing of each was prepared.
Twenty-three of the post molds formed a circular outline representing the perimeter of a house approximately 17 feet in diameter (Fig.
5). The peripheral molds averaged 0.5 feet in diameter and were
spaced, as a rule, about two feet apart. At the southeast edge of the
house were two parallel lines of three molds each which defined an extended entranceway. Because of disturbance in the entranceway area
by tree roots, only the bottom portions of the entrance molds were
preserved. Their arrangement suggests that some of the post molds
related to the original entranceway were not discovered.
Within the external ring of post molds were 30 irregularly spaced
molds, including four very large ones which probably held the bases of
relatively heavy roof supports. Two concentrations of smaller post molds
(one on the northeast side of the house, the other on the southwest
side) possibly mark the location of interior structures such as sleeping
or storage platforms. In the center of the house was a relatively large
post mold, over which the fire hearth had been built. This probably
represented a center post used in construction of the house and then
removed when the house was completed.
The hearth was located in a shallow depression at the center of the
house. It was in the form of a basin about four feet in diameter and one
foot deep. The sandy soil underlying the hearth had been burned to a
deep reddish color.
From all indications this house was constructed in a manner similar

to that described by early Spanish and French explorers in the Caddoan
Area (Swanton, 1942: 148-154). A ring of poles, each with its base end
set in a deep hole, was placed in upright position around a tall center
21

post used as a work platform. The tops of the poles were drawn together
at the center and bound. Small tree branches were then woven, horizontally, between the upright poles, grass thatching was applied, and,
in some cases, the exterior was plastered with a coat of clay mud. (Many
pieces of burned clay daub, some bearing impressions of sticks and
grass, were found on and above the floors of all the houses at the Harroun Site. ) After the house was completed, the center post, used only
to facilitate construction, was removed. Interior support posts may have
been added, and platforms for sleeping or storage were built inside the
house.
DISCUSSION
House No. 3, a circular, wattle-and-daub structure with a southeastern entranceway, was built on the surface of the Cypress Creek
floodplain. There were probably four interior roof support posts, two
or more interior platforms for sleeping or storage, and a centrally located, prepared hearth with a clay base. Possibly, a low embankment
of sand was thrown against the wall around the exterior of the house.
The period of occupation at the house is unknown, but the scarcity
of artifacts suggests that it was of short duration, or else that it was
used for specialized-perhaps ceremonial-purposes. A domiciliary
structure ordinarily would have much more cultural refuse about it
than did House No. 3, unless it was occupied for only a very brief
period of time. Stone chips and a few artifacts in the floodplain beneath
the house floor indicate that the spot had been lightly occupied prior
to the construction of the house.
That House No. 3 burned is evident from the charred poles and bits
of heavily burned, wattle-impressed, clay daub lying on and above the
house floor. Shortly after the burning, a mound of sandy soil, undoubtedly derived from the adjacent surface of the floodplain, was heaped
over the house ruins.
Burial of the house remains beneath a mound implies that the house
had a special significance, possibly of a ceremonial nature. Consequently it may be conjectured that perhaps House No. 3 was a small
temple or chapel which was ceremonially burned and buried.

22

Mound C
:\found C was situated on the west bank of the lake, 350 feet northwest of Mound B (Fig. 1 ) . This mound was in the shape of a broad
oval with its long axis oriented in an east-west direction. It measured
62 by 52 feet at the base and reached a maximum elevation of 102.6
feet, or slightly more than three feet above the modern surface of the
floodplain (Figs. 6 and 11, B).
There was a circular depression approximately nine feet in diameter
in the top of the mound where pothunters had been at work. Excavation revealed that the pothole had been dug to a depth of 4.8 feet and
had later been partially filled by natural agencies. Unfortunately, the
pothole had destroyed most of the central hearths associated with the
two house floors found at the base of the mound.
After the trees and bushes had been cleared from Mound C the
standard grid of 5-foot squares was established with a base stake set
125 feet south and 100 feet west of the approximate center point of the
mound. The initial step in excavating the mound was to dig the southwest quadrant down to elevation 100.0 feet. Next, the southeast quadrant was excavated to the same level so that an east-west profile remained standing completely across the mound. After the profile had
been studied and recorded, the other two quadrants were removed and
the entire mound was levelled at elevation 100.0 feet, where a circular
zone of dark soil containing a large amount of charcoal marked the outline of what later proved to be the remains of two houses, one superimposed on the other.
A narrow east-west trench was next dug across the house area, the
north edge of the trench being on the Nl25 line so that it matched the
bottom of the major east-west profile which had already been removed.
This trench revealed two thin layers of dark midden soil, each of which
represented the floor level of a house (Fig. 7). The two floor levels were
separated by a layer of clean, yellow sand. The lower floor rested on un-

disturbed soil at the base of the mound. Numerous charred segments
of poles lay in a jumble on and just above the upper floor as though the
house walls had burned and collapsed.
The house floors were completely excavated, the artifacts and other
material associated with each floor being collected and sacked separately
wherever possible. Two concentric rings of post molds at the periphery
of the house area were exposed and recorded, as were several interior
post molds (Fig. 8). An entrance passageway was delineated at the west
side of the house area.
In order to determine the relationship of the mound to the floodplain
several short trenches were carried from the edge of the mound out
into the floodplain formation (Fig. 6). A depressed area in the surface
of the floodplain between the mound and the lake was also trenched
in an effort to determine whether it may have been a borrow pit. Several
other trenches were dug south and west of the mound in an unfruitful
search for any middens, houses, burials, or other occupational features
that might have been located near the mound.
Throughout the excavation of Mound C, major profiles, horizontal
plans at 1/2-foot intervals, and occupational features were described in
the field notes and drawn to scale. Major profiles and features were
photographed. Most of the digging was done with shovels, but trowels
were used in part for excavating the two thin floor zones and for several
other situations where close attention to detail was desirable. Because
of time limitations only representative, spot screening was attempted_
STRUCTURE OF MOUND C
Profiles of Mound C revealed remnants of an old stabilized surface
with a well developed soil profile (including a superficial humic zone)
lying immediately beneath the mound fill (Fig. 7). The elevation of
the old surface averaged approximately 99.4 feet which is also the average elevation of the modern floodplain surface around the mound: therefore it appears certain that the first of the two houses was built directly
on the floodplain surface and that there has been no appreciable change
in the surface elevation of the floodplain since the mound was· built.
The first house burned, after which the second house was built over its
remains; then the second house burned and the mound was erected
over the ruins of the houses.

A low embankment of sand similar to that at Mound B encircled the
house area just outside the peripheral ring of house post molds (Fig. 7).
Apparently this embankment was built while one of the houses was still
standing since its inner edge is almost vertical in places as though it had
been banked against the outside wall of the house. After the later house
burned, the mound was heaped over both this embankment and the
house ruins.
The geologic structure of the floodplain at Mound C was apparently
the same as previously described although none of the excavations were
carried deep enough to expose Zone I, the basal member of reddish clay.
The mound structure rested on the surface of Zone Ile (Fig. 7) and
was composed of four distinct structural units as follows (in order from
bottom to top ) :

1. The lower house fioor zone (House No. 1). This zone was composed of blackish sand containing a large amount of charcoal and had
an average thickness of about 0.3 feet. It yielded some artifacts. This
lower house Hoar lay just above the surface of Zone Ile (the Hood plain
surface) from which it was separated by a thin (approximately 0.1-foot
thick) lens of compact sandy clay. The thin clay lens was apparently
a subsurface formation resulting from the deposition of clay by percolating water along the buried surface of the Hood plain.
2. The upper house fioor (House No. 2). This zone consisted of a
slightly compacted, brownish sand containing a large amount of charcoal and a few artifacts. It lay above the Hoor of House No. 1, and was
separated from it by a layer of clean, sterile, yellowish sand 0.1 to 0 ..3
feet thick which probably was placed over the burned ruins of the first
house to provide a clean Hoar for the second one.
3. The embankment of yellow-brown sand encircling the house
area. As was previously pointed out, this member had the appearance
of having been banked against the exterior wall of the house while it
was still standing. Perhaps this provided extra protection from the winter
winds, or its primary purpose may have been to serve as a dike to protect the house when Cypress Creek overflowed its banks. Th~ maximum height of this zone was 2.0 feet above the surface of Zone Ile,
upon which it rested.

4. The final addition to the mound. This was the sand member which

had been mounded over the house ruins. It was virtually sterile of
cultural material.
OCCUPATIONAL FEATURES
The only occupational features discovered at Mound C were the two
house patterns.

HouseNo.l
The lower house floor at Mound C, designated House No. 1, rested
directly on the old surface of the floodplain (Fig. 7). The floor zone was
a circular lens of dark gray-almost black-sand with a greasy texture.
It averaged 0.4 feet in thickness and measured some 18 feet across. This
floor zone contained numerous bits of charcoal and burned clay daub, a
few stone chips, mussel shells and garbage bones, and a small number
of artifacts.
Around the perimeter of the floor was a ring of post molds representing the exterior house wall (Fig. 8). Average diameter of the ring was
18 feet. Each post mold extended downward below the floor level into
the sub-mound floodplain. The individual molds ranged from 0.35 to
0.75 feet in diameter, the bottoms being from 1.3 to 2.0 feet below the
floor level. There was a total of 29 definite molds plus one probable
mold in the peripheral ring, and disturbances on the west and south
sides of the house appeared to have obliterated at least five others. The
posts had been set about 1.5 to 2.0 feet apart on an average. Time did
not permit vertical sectioning of all the molds, but several were carefully sectioned and studied to determine the level from which they had
been dug. All began at the floor of House No. 1, none extending above
that level.
The large pothole observed in the top of the mound continued downward entirely through the floor of House No. 1, although it had narrowed to a diameter of less than four feet where it intercepted the floor
(Fig. 8). Unfortunately the pothole had destroyed the major portion
of a centrally located hearth that must have been associated either with
House No. 1 or the overlying House No. 2. Actually, there was probably
a hearth for each house, the later one constructed directly. above the
earlier one. But since only a narrow segment of burned soil remained
to mark the eastern margin of the hearth (or hearths), the structural

details could not be ascertained. As nearly as could be estimated by the
surviving portion of the hearth, it must have been approximately three
feet in diameter.
Beneath the pothole-which luckily terminated a foot or so below
the floor of House No. I-were the bottom portions of two post molds
(Fig. 7). These were undoubtedly from the center posts used during
construction of Houses No. 1 and 2. Although the exact circumstances
could not be reconstructed because of disturbance, the center posts presumably were removed when the houses were completed and the hearths
placed over the molds.
In addition to the two center molds, there were two other post molds
within the interior of the houses at Mound C. One was just east of the
hearth area, the other was northwest of the hearth (Fig. 8). Both were
exposed in the excavation floor at the level of House No. 1, and since
they were not encountered above that level both probably relate to the
earlier house.
An extended entranceway on the west side of the houses was delineated by an elongated area of organically stained soil and by two
parallel rows of post molds (Fig. 8). The stained area was clearly discernible in the mound fill above both house floors. Despite extremely
careful excavation of this stained area, however, only the bottom portions of the post molds-well below the floor level of House No. 1could be seen. Consequently the level from which the entranceway post
holes were dug could not be determined and it is uncertain to which of
the two houses they belonged. House No. 2 must have had its entranceway on the west side because the organically stained outline showed
clearly in the mound fill well above the House 2 floor level. Possibly
both houses had their entranceways in this same area.

House No. 2
House No. 2 was represented by a distinct floor zone and by a circle
of post molds. The floor zone (Fig. 8) consisted of a lens of brownish
sand averaging about 15.5 feet in diameter, with a maximum thickness
near the center of almost a foot. It lay directly above the floor of House
No. 1, but was separated from it by a thin layer of clean, sterile sand
0.1 to 0.3 feet thick. The sterile sand layer was possibly placed over the
burned ruins of House No. 1 in order to provide a clean floor for House
No.2.

The peripheral ring of post molds (Fig. 8) averaged a little less than
14 feet in diameter (or almost four feet less than that of the underlying
House No. 1) and lay entirely inside the exterior wall of House No. 1.
The two rings were not quite concentric, however, the center point of
House No. 2 being slightly to the west of the center point of House
No. 1. The post molds of House No. 2 were from 0.45 to 0.85 feet in diameter, and they extended from 1.6 to 2.0 feet below the level of the
related house floor. Several of the molds were sectioned vertically to
determine the level from which they had been dug. They could be
clearly traced from the floor of House No. 2 down through the floor of
House No. 1 into the sub-mound floodplain.
As was pointed out above in the description of House No. 1, there
was probably a circular, centrally located hearth associated with House
No. 2, and one of the two center posts whose molds were found beneath
the hearth area must have been used in the construction of the later
house. There appeared to be no other interior post molds associated
with House No. 2. The entranceway was probably on the west side.
DISCUSSION
Excavation of Mound C revealed that a circular house (House No. 1)
was built on the south bank of the Harroun Site lake, was occupied for
an unknown period of time, then was burned-perhaps intentionally.
After a thin layer of sand had been strewn over the burned ruins, a
second, smaller house (House No. 2) was erected on the remains of the
earlier house. House No. 2 was likewise destroyed by fire, after which
the remains of both houses were buried under a mound of sand.
Both houses probably had centrally located hearths, and one or both
of them had an entranceway opening to the west. As at Mound B, a low
pile of sandy soil may have been banked around the outside of one or
both houses before they were destroyed. Architecturally the houses at
Mound C were quite similar to the one at Mound B.
The sparse occurrence of artifacts and other cultural refuse suggests
that neither House No. 1 nor House No. 2 was an ordinary domicile. It
appears likely, rather, that both were ceremonial structures of so.me sort.
This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the houses were considered
important enough to be afforded burial beneath a mound, probably
after having been ceremonially "cremated."

31

Mound D
This low circular mound was located on the south bank of Cypress
Creek about 150 feet east of Mound A (Fig. 1 ) . It was perched at the
very edge of the floodplain overlooking the creek channel. In recent
years the channel had been migrating laterally and had begun to encroach on the north edge of the mound. The average diameter of Mound
D at the base was about 60 feet, and its highest point was at a relative
elevation of 100.6 feet, or about 2.5 feet above the surface of the surrounding floodplain (Fig. 9). A shallow depression about 12 feet across
in the top of the mound marked the location of the usual pothole. This
pothole had originally been only 5 to 6 feet in diameter, but had been
considerably enlarged at the surface of the mound by recent erosion.
Excavation of Mound D was begun shortly before the end of the 1958
field season. It was dug, like the other mounds, by the quadrant method;
but, because there was not enough time for thorough excavation, only
the southwest quadrant was carried down to the sub-mound level in
1958. The other three quadrants were taken down to the 98-foot level,
however, where a circular zone of dark, organically stained soil, 19.8
feet in diameter, clearly outlined the location of a house structure
(House No. 4) similar to those at Mounds B and C. During the final
work at Harroun in February, 1959, the entire northwest quadrant was
exposed, excavated, and recorded. Only the peripheral ring of post molds
was exposed in the other two quadrants.
The southwest quadrant of the mound was excavated in 0.5-foot
levels; all other portions were taken down in LO-foot levels. Horizontal
plans were recorded at all levels and photographs were taken. Vertical
walls 1.5 feet thick were preserved across the mound along the WlOO
and NlOO lines (Fig. 9), and trenches three feet wide were extended
north, south, and west of the mound in order to obtain complete vertical
profiles. Excavation and recording methods were generally the same
as previously described for the other mounds.

STRUCTURE OF MOUND D
The structure of Mound D was clearly indicated by the vertical cross
sections (Fig. 7). An old humus-stained surface underlying the marginal portions of the mound was sharply defined at an average elevation
of 98.0 feet. No artifacts or cultural refuse were found in the floodplain
below this surface. Prior to construction of the mound a shallow, circular pit had been excavated in the surface of the floodplain to an average
depth of 1.5 feet. The sides of the pit sloped sharply downward, and
the floor was approximately level. An embankment of yellow-brown
sand, possibly composed of back-dirt from the pit, was mounded up
about 1.5 feet high and four to six feet wide around the perimeter of
the pit. This light sand zone contained a few artifacts but little or no
charcoal.
A hard-packed house floor about 0.2 feet thick lay on the bottom of
the pit. This floor zone was composed of compact sandy clay which contrasted sharply with the overlying mound fill. Charcoal, ash, and burned
clay daub were found in quantity in the floor zone, but only a few artifacts were recovered. Just above the house floor was a 1-foot thick layer
of dark gray-brown sand containing several charred poles and a large
amount of charcoal, ash, and burned clay daub. Above that was the
sandy fill making up the bulk of the mound. A mantle of surface humus
from 0.2 to 0.8 feet thick covered the mound.
A ring of post molds was discovered around the edge of the floor, and
other molds on the west side of the house marked the position of an
extended entranceway (Fig. 10). No interior post molds were discovered.
The pothole, which extended downward through the center of the
floor, had apparently removed a centrally located hearth, only slight
evidence of burning at the edge of the pothole remaining to show that
the hearth had been there.
The entire mound fill, including the embankment around the house,
was composed of various shades and textures of sand. All of this material was probably derived from the sandy floodplain surrounding the
mound. Small quantities of clay around the hearth and on .the house
floor could have been acquired at nearby outcrops in the stream channel.
As at Mounds B and C, the circular shape of the house at Mound D
was outlined by an area of organically stained soil which extended up-

34

ward from the house floor almost to the surface of the mound. The
ilanks of all three mounds were of light colored sand which contrasted
sharply with the dark, circular house outlines. The only reasonable conjecture thus far advanced to explain this circumstance is that a low embankment of relatively clean sand had been piled against the exterior
wall of each house. Thus when a house burned the embankment would
remain standing, well above the house floor, as a sort of mold of the
lower portion of the house. Then when a mound was erected over the
burned house remains and the standing embankment, the outline of
the house might appear in the mound fill as a cast of the house, delineated by the circular embankment.
OCCUPATIONAL FEATURES
House No. 4 was the only occupational feature discovered at Mound
D.

House No. 4
This house was circular in shape, with an exterior wall formed of upright poles, wattle, and clay daub. Post molds indicated that there were
at least 27 of the upright poles in the exterior wall (Fig. 10). They were
0.3 to 0.6 foet in diRmeter at the base and were set about two feet apart
on :m average. An interior hearth near the center of the house was
probably circular in shape and an estimated three to four feet in diameter. Its exact dimensions could not be determined because of disturbance by the pothole. No interior post molds were found.
Remains of an extended entranceway on the west side of the house
consisted in five post molds which outlined the two parallel sides of the
entranceway. The entranceway was slightly less than three feet wide,
and it sloped downward from the surface of the floodplain into the
house pit.
Burned poles and burned clay daub with wattle impressions showed
that House No. 4 had been destroyed by fire.
DISCUSSION
Investigation of Mound D revealed that the following sequence of
events had taken place. A round, Caddoan type of house (House No.
4) with an extended entranceway on the west side was built in a shal-

low, excavated pit on the south bank of Cypress Creek. Architecturally
the house was quite similar to those at Mounds B and C. Sand was
probably banked against the outside wall of the house to a height of
somewhat more than a foot. After an unknown period of time the house
was destroyed by fire, and then the house remains and the surrounding
embankment of sand were buried beneath a mound of sandy soil. This
duplicates essentially the events reconstructed for Mounds B and C, the
only unique feature at Mound D being the pit in which the house was
built,
Probable ceremonial burning, burial beneath a mound, and a scarcity
of domestic artifacts and refuse suggest that House No. 4 was not an
ordinary residence, but a small temple, chapel, or similar structure used
for ceremonial purposes.

Description of the A.rtifacts
A total of 610 artifacts was recovered from the Harroun Site, consisting of ceramics, chipped stone implements, and a few milling stones and
pitted stones. The first step in ordering the artifacts was to lump them
all together in one heap. Then they were separated into general groups
such as pottery, dart points, arrow points, scrapers, pitted stones, etc.
Next, each group was further divided and subdivided into as many
categories as seemed warranted until a number of small groups resulted,
each containing a series of individual specimens with similar basic
characteristics. 4 Finally, each of the small groups was compared to
similar material from other sites and identified with specific types
wherever possible.
The artifacts are described below by groups. Provenience of the
groups and types within the site is discussed in the succeeding section.
CERAMICS
In addition to the two vessels from the burial at Mound A, ceramic
specimens comprise a total of 562 sherds. The paste of these sherds is
characteristically sherd tempered, occasionally with the addition of
small quantities of sand and/or bone particles. There is no shell tempering. Study of the sherds indicates that bottles, jars with outcurved rims,
carinated bowls, and possibly other forms are represented. Exterior surface treatment includes brushing, smoothing, polishing, and red filming;
smoothing and red filming also occur as interior surface treatments.
Techniques used in applying decorations are incising, engraving, appliqueing, and punctating.
" In the preliminary sorting an effort was made to disregard all previously described types insofar as possible. It is believed by the writers that more realistic
results can be obtained if the artifacts from a specific site are compared and grouped
on a basis of their own characteristics, and not on a basis of preconceived forms,
styles, and types recognized at other sites.

The small quantity of sherds did not permit reconstruction of any
vessels nor of any complete design elements: consequently correlations
between techniques of decorating, design elements, vessel shapes and
surface treatment were impossible as a rule, and a comprehensive typological analysis of the ceramics could not be made.
The ceramics were separated on the basis of decorative technique
into six groups: brushed, incised, appliqued, punctated, engraved, and
plain. Each group is described separately below.

Brushed Pottery
Of the 141 brushed sherds, 13 are rimsherds and 128 arc from body
areas. The brushing is always on the exterior surface, the interior surfaces being poorly to fairly well smoothed. Wall thickness ranges from
5 to 9 mm. Lips are rounded and slightly everted.
Clay lumps of varying sizes-evidently ground up sherds-are visible
in the paste of most sherds, and 39 of the 141 brushed sherds also contain bone tempering. There are particles of sand in all the sherds, a few
having so much that their surfaces have a distinctly sandy feel when
rubbed between the fingers. Paste colors range from creams and buffs
to fairly <lark grays, with most sherds falling into the lighter shades of
buff, brown, and gray-indicative of oxidation during firing. Some
sherds have light exterior surfaces and dark interior surfaces, suggesting
that the vessels stood upside down during firing.
Most of the brushed sherds could not he definitely identified with any
specific pottery types; however, several sherds were assigned to the
types Bullard Brushed of the Frankston Focus ( Suhm et al., 1954: 252
and PL 9) and Pease Brushed-Incised of the Bossier Focus (Webb,
1948: 110-113 and Pls. 11 & 12; Suhm et al., 1954: 338 and Pl. 53).
There are 17 Bullard Brushed sherds, 13 of them from the body of a
single vessel, the other four from the rim of another vessel (Fig. 13,
A-B ). All were found at Mound C. Both vessels were barrel-shaped with
a slight, evenly curved constriction in the neck area. There were one or
more horizontal rows of punctations made with a blunt stick separating
the body area from the rim area on both vessels, but there was no angle
at the juncture of the body and the rim. On the vessel represented only
by body sherds, the brushing consisted of short, overlapping strokes in
random directions, creating a roughened exterior of uneven appearance.
The rim treatment of this vessel could not be determined. The other

39

Bullard Brushed vessel was represented by four rimsherds which fitted
together. The rim of this vessel curved outwardly and was evenly
brushed in a diagonal direction. A horizontal row of punctations appeared at the bottom of the rim. Both Bullard vessels were relatively
large with wide mouths.
Six of the brushed body sherds (Fig. 13, C, D, G) were identified as
type Pease Brushed-Incised because they have vertically brushed sections separated by vertical applique strips. Five are from Mound D, the
other from Mound A. Five of the six have closely spaced punctations
or indentations pressed into the strips. One of the Pease body sherds
(Fig. 13, D) is attached to a portion of the rim which is brushed horizontally. On this sherd there is a marked angle at the juncture of the
body and the rim, and a horizontal row of small punctations made with
the blunt end of a stick is impressed along the line of the angle. Other
Pease sherds with incising instead of brushing are described later.
The other ll8 brushed sherds were not assigned to definite types, but
will be described here as a group. In all or most of the vessels represented by the miscellaneous brushed sherds the coiling method was
employed. Fractures along coil lines, and vessel curvature on some of
the larger sherds, made it possible to orient 30 of the brushed body
sherds with respect to the vessels from which they came. The brushing
on all 30 is in an approximately vertical direction (Fig. 14, C-D). The
nine rimsherds, in contrast, are all brushed horizontally (Fig. 14, A-B)
except for one which is brushed diagonally. On one sherd containing
portions of both body and rim, the body is brushed vertically and the
rim horizontally. The body and rim areas are separated on this sherd by
a horizontal row of small, closely spaced punctations made with a
pointed instrument. On three of the nine rimsherds there are similar
single rows of punctations just below the lip.
The miscellaneous brushed sherds appear to have come, by and large,
from jars with outcurved rims, the bodies brushed vertically and the
rims brushed horizontally. The body and rim areas were probably separated in most cases by a horizontal row of closely spaced punctations
made with the end of a stick, and similar rows of punctations were
placed on some rims just below the lip at the top of the brushed zone.
The juncture of the body and the rim usually formed a distinct angle.
There is the possibility that some vessels with brushed bodies had plain

or incised rims, or, conversely, that some with brushed rims had plain
or incised bodies. The horizontally brushed rims, some with punctations, are quite similar to the rims of type Pease Brushed-Incised, and
it is quite likely that some of the brushed sherds came from Pease vessels. It is also possible that some of the brushed body sherds are from
vessels with incised rims of the Maydelle Incised type ( Suhm et al.,
1954: 324 and PI. 46) described later.

Incised Pottery
Thirty-nine sherds with incised lines were found at the Harroun Site,
31 of them body sherds and the other eight from rims. The incised
sherds are all sherd tempered with varying amounts of sand included
in the paste. Bone tempering is also present in eight. Surface colors are
predominantly light browns and grays, indicating an oxidizing atmosphere during firing. The characteristic surface treatment of the exteriors
is smoothing (done before incising), and all the interiors are smoothed.
Wall thickness varies from 4 to 8 mm. Two sherds have red slips.
Eleven of the incised sherds have vertical or diagonal applique strips
marking off the vessel body into panels, each panel being decorated
with parallel incised lines (Fig. 13, E-F). These have all the characteristics of Pease Brushed-Incised body sherds, and they have all been
assigned to that type.
One sherd (Fig. 14, E) with punctation-filled incised panels is unmistakably from a bowl of type Crockett Curvilinear Incised of the Alto
Focus, Gibson Aspect (Newell and Krieger, 1949: 98-101 and Fig. 36).
This sherd has a straight rim with a squarish lip; the exterior was
smoothed before decorating and the interior is poorly smoothed. Decoration consists of a portion of one curvilinear panel outlined with incised lines and filled with small, crescentic punctations. Part of a cracklacing hole is retained on one edge of the sherd. This specimen was
found in a disturbed area at Mound B.
A sharply incurving rimsherd (Fig. 13, H) with four parallel incised
lines in the broad, flat lip is from a vessel which was not of traditional
Caddoan shape or decoration. It was found over four feet deep in Zone
lib of the floodplain near Mound A. The incurving rim, the flat lip, and
the position of the incised lines are all quite similar to styles of the
Lower Mississippi Area-especially as exemplified by the types Coles
Creek Incised and Chase Incised (Ford, 1951: 74-77). Another inter-

41

esting feature of this sherd is a bright red slip which covers both the interior and the exterior surfaces.
A second sherd (Fig. 13, I) with characteristically Lower Mississippi
design is also from Zone Ilb of the floodplain. This sherd came from the
neck area of a jar and has portions of a decorated rim and a plain body.
The decoration consists of two sets of parallel lines crossing each other
at an angle so as to form a series of diamond-shaped elements. Inside
each diamond is a triangular punctation made with the corner of an
angular instrument. There is an abrupt decrease in wall thickness at the
bottom of the rim so that a typically Lower Mississippian "overhanging
line" effect is produced. In design and general execution this sherd is
similar to the type Beldeau Incised (Ford, 19.51: 81-83) of the Coles
Creek period in the Lower Mississippi Area, but its paste appears to be
more in the Caddoan than in the Baytown tradition.
The 25 incised sherds not assignable to any specific type comprise
five rimsherds and 20 body sherds. Fifteen of the body sherds bear thin
lines sliced into the plastic clay with a sharp instrument; the other 10
were incised with a blunt-tipped implement which gouged out, rather
than sliced, the lines. Two sherds (Fig. 14, G) have a horizontal row of
closely spaced punctations in the neck area. Of the five rimsherds, one
has three widely spaced, horizontal, incised lines; three (Fig. 14, F)
have a design of widely spaced, cross hatched incised lines; the fifth
bears traces of two horizontal incised lines on the lower part of the rim
above a plain body. Some of the smaller body sherds could have come
from Pease Brushed-Incised vessels and the three rimsherds with cross
hatched design could well be from Maydelle Incised vessels.
Thus the 39 incised sherds include at least 11 from vessels of type
Pease Brushed-Incised, one is type Crockett Curvilinear Incised, and
two appear to be intrusions from the late Coles Creek period of the
Lower Mississippi Area. The unidentified sherds are all typically Caddoan in their general characteristics, and three of them may represent
type Maydelle Incised of the Frankston Focus.
Appliqued Pottery
The decorative technique of appliqueing occurs commonly at the
Harroun Site, principally in combination with brushing and incising on
the type Pease Brushed-Incised described above. However, there are
five sherds with applique strips but with no traces of brushing or incis-

42

ing (Fig. 14, J). Paste characteristics of these sherds are the same as for
the previously described appliqued sherds of the Pease type, and it is
believed that they are from vessels similar to Pease Brushed-Incised
except that the panels on the body were left plain instead of being filled
with brushing or incised lines.

Punctated Pottery
As stated in previous sections, horizontal rows of punctations occur
commonly in combination with brushing on the rims of jars, and punctations also appear in vertical rows on applique strips applied to the
bodies of Pease Brushed-Incised jars. Thus punctations seem to occur
most commonly in association with incising, brushing, and appliqueing.
However, eight sherds have punctations as the only decorative technique. Four of them have sections of single rows of closely spaced punctations, all made with the ends of sticks or similar implements (Fig.
14, H). The other four sherds (Fig. 14, I ) are covered with small, free
punctations. On one of the latter the punctations were made with a
blunt stick; the other three have paired fingernail impressions.
The punctated sherds are all similar in paste characteristics. All are
sherd tempered and one also has a small amount of bone temper. Exterior colors are light to medium brown and gray, while the interiors
tend toward darker shades of the same colors. The exterior surfaces
were smoothed before the punctations were applied; the interiors are
also smoothed.
The punctated sherds are not distinctive enough for typological
identification.

Engraved Pottery
Only two complete pottery vessels were found at the Harroun Site, a
carinated bowl and a bottle, both engraved and both associated with the
burial beneath Mound A.
The carinated bowl (Fig. 12, B) has a flat, round base and a compound rim which turns sharply inward at the shoulder to form a narrow,
almost vertical panel approximately 1.5 cm. high. Above this panel the
rim turns sharply outward to form a second panel extending to the lip.
Four equally spaced peaks rise from the upper panel of the rim. The
bowl stands 9.5 cm. high and measures 21.0 cm. wide between opposing
rim peaks. Both the exterior and the interior surfaces have been well
43

smoothed, and marks of the smoothing tool are clearly visible both inside and outside the vessel.
The lower rim panel of the carinated bowl bears a stylized version of
the interlocking scroll design, featuring broad, deep, engraved lines
with small excised zones. The upper rim panel has elongated triangular
designs on the rim peak areas with broad, parallel, vertical, engraved
lines within the triangles. An almost identical bowl is pictured by Suhm
et al., ( 1954: PI. 57, I) as an example of the type Ripley Engraved.
The engraved bottle (Fig. 12, C) has a broad, squat body and a tall
neck with expanded rim. Total height is 23.l cm. The body is 12.8 cm.
high by 18.3 cm. wide; the height of the neck is 10.3 cm., its minimal
diameter is 4.5 cm., and the oral diameter is 5.5 cm. An interlocking
scroll design is repeated twice (slightly asymmetrically) on the body,
and some of the engraved lines have small, pendant triangles which are
hachured or excised. There are also several cross hatched, triangular
elements. The exterior surface is dark gray in color and has been well
smoothed. The bottle has been identified as an example of type Ripley
Engraved ( Suhm et al., 1954: 346 and Pl. 59).
In addition to the two vessels from Burial No. 1, examples of the
engraving technique appear on 107 sherds from the Harroun Site. The
paste of these sherds is fairly consistent in being fine grained and relatively hard, and all appear to have sherd temper. The paste of the engraved sherds also contains moderate amounts of sand, and 23 of them
have bone particles added as a supplementary tempering agent. Surfaces are smoothed, both on the interior and exterior, and the exterior
surfaces of several sherds are highly polished. Fractures along coil lines
indicate that manufacture was by the coiling method. Wall thickness
ranges from 3 to 7 mm.
A big majority of the engraved sherds are from the rims of carinated
bowls with rounded, out-turned lips, but several are from the bodies of
bottles and one is from the rim of a jar. Most of the sherds are small,
having sections of from one to four engraved lines which are too incomplete to reveal any distinctive design elements: consequently no typological affiliations can be determined for them. There are some, however, which can definitely be assigned to previously recognized typological categories.
On four sherds (Fig. 14, L) are small, excised, diamond-shaped element!> enclosed by concentric diamond-shaped lines, and two sherds
44

(Fig. 14, K, M) are decorated with swastikas enclosed by circles. Both
of these designs are known only on the type Ripley Engraved; therefore there is no hesitation in identifying these six sherds as Ripley. Two
other sherds with portions of Ripley-like designs were assigned to the
same type.
One sherd (Fig. 14, 0) from a small carinated bowl is decorated
with a curvilinear interlocking scroll design characteristic of the type
Taylor Engraved ( Suhm et al., 1954: 360-362 and Pl. 65). Another
sherd (Fig. 14, N) from an engraved bottle appears also to be of the
Taylor type, as does an engraved rimsherd (Fig. 14, P) from a jar.
Four sherds came from the lower neck region of a bottle. A single,
fairly heavy, engraved line filled with red pigment encircled the base of
the neck, and the neck contracted sharply toward the top in typically
Gibson Aspect style. The paste is fine grained in texture and almost
black in color. The exterior is well smoothed and polished, but the interior is very poorly smoothed, as is usual for Caddoan Area bottles. The
wall of the neck is 6 mm. thick. This bottle is almost certainly a Gibson
Aspect form, possibly type Hickory Fine Engraved of the Alto Focus
(Newell and Krieger, 1949: 90-91 and Fig. 33; Suhm et al., 1954: 294
and Pl. 31). It was associated with the floor of House No. 3 at Mound B.
The other 92 engraved sherds could not be identified with any specific types. However, they all are from carinated bowls and bottles
characteristic of the Fulton Aspect, the forcefully engraved lines of
many suggesting Titus Focus in particular. An interesting note is the
occasional widening of an engraved line by a series of closely spaced,
gouged out lines, creating small zones which are not quite completely
excised (Fig. 14, K). The identical technique was noted by E. Mott
Davis ( 1958: 61) at the Whelan Site, located on Cypress Creek about
15 miles below the Harroun Site. This treatment is similar in a general
way to that of the type Poynor Engraved of the Frankston Focus, but
the design elements on which it occurs, both at Harroun and Whelan,
are characteristic of Titus Focus (types Ripley, Taylor, and Wilder
Engraved) and not of Frankston Focus.
In general, the engraved pottery at the Harroun Site indicates Titus
Focus affiliation, the only exception being the one Gibson Aspect bottle
fragment. Ripley Engraved is the most common type, but type Taylor
Engraved and probably type Wilder Engraved are also present.

Plain Pottery
A total of 260 plain potsherds was recovered from the four mounds
and the trenches in the floodplain. Paste of the plain pottery contains
varying amounts of sand, and all or most of the sherds are tempered
with ground potsherds. Bone tempering is present in 31 plain sherds.
Wall thickness varies from .3 mm. for the thinnest body sherds to 1.3 mm.
for some basal sherds.
The surfaces are smoothed and some are highly polished. Sixteen
plain sherds are red filmed, seven of them on the exterior surface only
and the others on both the inner and outer surfaces. Paste colors are
mostly browns and grays, with shades ranging from very light to quite
dark.
Carinated bowls, bottles, and probably other vessel shapes are represented. Many of the plain sherds undoubtedly came from vessels which
were partially decorated; others probably are from entirely plain vessels. Of the 14 rimsherds, seven are large enough to show that the rims
of some vessels were not decorated. No definite types were recognized.
Miscellaneous Ceramic Ob;ects
A perforated pottery disc (Fig. 14, Q) made from a sherd was found
at Mound C. It is 32 mm. in diameter, 8 mm. thick, and has a biconically
drilled hole 10 mm. in diameter in the center. The outer edge has been
partially ground smooth and the two Hat sides are fairly well polished.
The sherd from which this artifact was made is buff in color, clay
tempered, and the paste is fine textured and compact.
A small, conical, ceramic object (Fig.14, R) was unearthed at Mound
B. It appears to be the tip of an appendage that has broken off an effigy
vessel or a pipe bowl. It is oval in cross section, and the distal end contracts to a blunt point. The buff-colored paste is fine grained and compact; the surface is poorly smoothed. This object measures 18 mm. long
and its maximum diameter at the proximal end is 8 mm.
STONE ARTIFACTS
The 46 lithic artifacts include dart points, arrow points, bifacial
blades, worked nodules, pitted stones, and other objects. All the chipped
stone implements are made of local quartzites and cherts which occur
as very small nodules in the older stream terraces near the Harroun

Site. The sandstone and hematite employed for the other stone artifacts
were most likely collected from local sources also.
Dart Points

Of the 19 dart points recovered, 15 have contracting stems, 3 have
expanding stems, and one has a rectangular stem. Eight of the contracting stem series (Fig. 15, A-D) fall within the shape range of the
Gary type (Newell and Krieger, 1949: 164-166 and Fig. 57; Suhm et al.,
1954: 430 and Pl. 94), but are smaller (3 to 4 cm. long) than most Gary
points reported from other sites. The Gary type has been used as an
inclusive group embracing most of the contracting stem dart points
of the eastern United States. Several investigators (Ford and Webb,
1956: 52-54 and Fig. 17; Baerreis et al., 1958: 65-69 and Pis. 14-18; Bell,
1958: 28 and Fig. 14) have recognized variants within the broad Gary
group, but only a bare beginning toward the definition of the different
varieties of Gary has been made.
Three of the Gary points from the Harroun Site (Fig. 15, B-D) are
quite similar to a small variety of Gary which seems to be restricted to
northeastern Texas. The shoulders are slight and project laterally; the
stem and blade are of approximately equal length. Similar points from
the Hogge Bridge Site, Wylie Focus, have been illustrated by Stephenson ( 1952, Fig. 95, A). Many specimens of this variety were also recovered from the Yarbrough Site on the upper Sabine River by The University of Texas in 1940, and others have been reported from sites in
the Iron Bridge Reservoir area on the upper Sabine (Johnson, 1957: 7
and Pl. 3, H-L).
Two of the contracting stem points from the Harroun Site (Fig.
15, F) have been assigned to the Wells type (Newell and Krieger,
1949: 167 and Fig ..58; Suhm et al., 19.54: 488 and PL 12.3). They feature
long, narrow stems which are rounded off at the base and the stem edges
are ground smooth. One specimen is virtually complete except for a
small portion of the tip. This point has narrow shoulders and a blade
with slightly convex edges. The second Wells point is represented only
by the stem, but it was probably attached to a blade similar to that of
the more complete specimen.
Four of the contracting stem dart points (Fig. 15, J-M) are not assignable with certainty to any recognized type. All are relatively small for
dart points. One (Fig. 15, J) is slender and shoulderless; the stem area

47

is somewhat reminiscent of the Wells type. The other three are vaguely
suggestive of the Gary type, but are too aberrant to be identified affirmatively with that or any other type.
The other contracting stem point (Fig. 15, N) has a concave base,
basal thinning, and ground stem edges. At first glance it reminds one of
the Plainview type (Krieger, 1947; Suhm et al., 1954: 472 and PL 116).
However, a drastic expansion just above the base is characteristic of
the San Patrice type (Webb, 1946: 13-15 and Pl. 1) and we are confident that this specimen is a San Patrice point.
One of the expanding stem dart points (Fig. 15, H ) has a triangular
blade, slight shoulders, and a fairly large stem with smoothed edges.
This point is similar to the Trinity type ( Suhm et al., 1954: 484-486 and
PL 82) but is also somewhat reminiscent of type Yarbrough (Ibid.: 492
and Pl. 125).
Another point (Fig. 15, E) of the expanding stem series has been
assigned to the Ellis type (Newell and Krieger, 1949: 166-167 and Fig.
58; Suhm et al., 1954: 420-422 and PL 89).
The third expanding stem dart point (Fig. 15, I ) is the crudest of the
series. The stem is relatively small and the basal portion is missing. It
falls in the general range of the Palmillas type ( Suhm et al., 1954: 462
and PL 110).
The dart point with a rectangular stem (Fig. 15, G) is easily the
largest projectile point found at the site. The triangular blade has mildly
convex edges, and the moderate sized shoulders are slightly barbed. We
are reluctant to identify this specimen with any specific type, but in
general style it is suggestive of the Bulverde type ( Suhm et al., 1954:
404 and Pl. 81). Extreme varieties of the Yarbrough and Morrill types
also approach the form of this specimen.

Arrow Points
Only six arrow points were found, including the one associated with
Burial No. 1. The burial point (Fig. 15, 0) is of the Perdiz type ( Suhm
et al., 1954: 504 and PL 131). It has a relatively short pointed stem and
sharp barbs.
Of the remaining five arrow points, three (Fig. 15, P-R) have contracting stems and are of the Perdiz type; the other two (Fig. 15, S-T)
have expanding stems and could not be identified with any known type.
The three Perdiz points are almost identical in form and are remarkably

uniform in size, all falling between 18 and 19 mm. long by 11 to 12 mm.
wide at the shoulder. One of the expanding stem arrow points (Fig.
15, S) is in the same size range as these three Perdiz points, the other
is somewhat larger. All of the arrow points except the one from the
burial have serrated blade edges.
Bifacial Blades
The two bifacial blades could have been used as small knives,
scrapers, or even projectile points. One (Fig. 16, E), represented by the
basal portion, is a triangular blade with a straight base. It is 3.6 cm. wide
at the base and is estimated to have been approximately 7 cm. long
when complete. It is fairly thin and of reasonably good workmanship.
The second bifacial blade (Fig. 16, F) is smaller than the other,
measuring 4.2 cm. long by 2.8 cm. wide at the base. It is crudely pointed
at the distal end and has a convex base. The blade edges are sinuous
and show little evidence of wear.
Worked Nodules
Six small nodules of chert have been worked and show signs of wear
along the worked edges (Fig. 16, A-D). All were fashioned from small
elongated nodules by chipping a sharp edge at one end of the nodule,
leaving the basal end smooth and unworked. They are from 4 to 6.5 cm.
long. Two of them (Fig. 16, A-B) are chipped only across one end of
the nodule; the others are chipped across one end and down both sides,
only the basal end of the nodule being unaltered. Similar artifacts are
quite common in sites over most or all of East Texas, but their purpose
is unknown.
Drills
An elongated, pointed implement (Fig. 16, G) with the basal portion
missing appears to be the shank of a drill. It has been chipped from gray
chert. This fragment is 4.3 cm. long and is from 5 to 13 mm. wide. It is
triangular in cross section and the distal end is slightly worn along the
edges as though from use.
Fragmentary Chipped Stone Artifacts
Four fragments of chipped stone implements are too incomplete for
accurate description. Some or all of them are probably blade fragments
from projectile points or bifacial blades.

49

Milling Stones
One incomplete milling stone is made of light gray quartzite (Fig.
16, J). It has been pecked around the edges into a broad oval shape
and it is smooth from use on both faces. It is 9.8 cm. long, 8.2 cm. wide,
and 3.6 cm. thick.
Three small stone fragments smoothed on one face are probably
pieces of milling stones, but all are too fragmentary for their original
shapes to be determined.

Grooved Stones
An irregular shaped piece of hematite (Fig. 16, I) has several narrow, intersecting grooves running across one face. The grooves are set
at apparently random angles. On the opposite face of this fragment is
part of a deep, gouged out pit where the red pigment was evidently
scraped away for use as paint.
A piece of fine grained sandstone (Fig. 16, H) has a broad U-shaped
groove across one face. The groove is 20 mm. wide and 6 mm. deep.
Several small pieces of hematite bearing faint scratches were probably used as sources of pigment.
Pitted Stones
There are four pieces of sandstone and hematite with more or less flat
sides that have small, circular pits pecked into them (Fig. 16, K). Three
have one pit each, the other has two pjts on opposite sides of the stone.
The pits are all between 2.5 and 3.0 cm. wide and they vary from 4 to
8mm. deep.
Miscellaneous Ground Stone Artifacts
Three small pieces of stone are smoothed on one face. One is a cobble
measuring 17.7 cm. long, 5.8 cm. wide, and 3.3 cm. thick. The others are
too fragmentary for reconstruction, but seem to be pieces of small grinding slabs.
PROVENIENCE OF THE ARTIFACTS
The provenience of the artifacts at the Harroun Site is summarized in
Table 1. It is clear that the artifacts associated with each house, with
the fill of each mound, and with the upper part of the floodplain deposits are quite similar, in the main, throughout the site. Or put another

50

way, each major type or category of artifacts is more or less evenly
distributed over the site. This supports the conclusion that the burial,
the four houses, the four mounds, and most of the artifacts in the upper
part of the floodplain are associated with a single occupation of the site
by one cultural group. Architectural and structural data from the
mounds point toward the same conclusion.
The only apparent variation from the general provenience pattern is
the occurrence of all 17 of the Bullard Brushed sherds at Mound C.
However, only two vessels are represented by the Bullard sherds, and
because of the small sample it is probably of no particular significance
that they all were found at one mound.
Some of the projectile point types may have derived exclusively from
a light pre-mound occupation of Archaic affiliation. But the Gary and
Perdiz types are unquestionably associated with the mounds and the
houses. The Coles Creek Incised (?) and Beldeau Incised (?) sherds
may pre-date the mounds.

Summary and Discussion
Excavations at the Harroun Site in Upshur County, Texas, revealed
abundant evidence of a Fulton Aspect occupation related to four small
mounds on the floodplain of Cypress Creek. An earlier pre-mound occupation was indicated by the presence of a-few scattered artifacts and
stone chips buried as deeply as four feet below the surface of the floodplain. Remains of the pre-mound occupation are very sparse, however,
and it is not possible to make an accurate statement of its character. The
predominance of stone chips and crude stone artifacts suggests Archaic
affiliation, but Fulton Aspect sherds also occurred well down in the
floodplain and no pure Archaic zones were found.
The internal structure of each of the four mounds was determined in
some detail. Beneath Mound A, the smallest one, was an extended
burial of an adolescent male. Offerings associated with the burial were
a Perdiz arrow point, a small carinated bowl, and a bottle with an expanding neck. Both vessels are of the Ripley Engraved type. The grave
had been dug from the bottom of a broad, shallow pit excavated in the
surface of the floodplain; the mound had then been erected over the
grave.
A prepared clay hearth in the middle of the mound fill indicated that
Mound A had been built in two stages. However, the uneroded condition of the hearth and the absence of a discernible break between the
upper and lower portions of the mound disallow the possibility of an
appreciable lapse of time between the two construction stages. Since
the mound fill contained a quantity of cultural refuse, it must have been
taken from a nearby area of fairly heavy occupation. The floodplain
near Mound A was tested by means of trenches and small pits, but the
assumed occupation area was not discovered.
Mounds B, C, and D each contained evidence of at least one circular
house structure which had been burned and then mounded over with

54

sand. Because of the consistent pattern of burning, paucity of domestic
artifacts, and burial of the house ruins beneath mounds, it is believed
that the structures were ceremonial in function and that the burning
was intentional. The few artifacts associated with the house structures
indicate that they all were built by a single group of people related to
the Titus Focus of the Fulton Aspect.
The house at Mound B was 17 feet in diameter. It had an extended
entranceway on the southeast side, a centrally located hearth prepared
of clay, and several interior roof supports. This house had been built
directly on the surface of the floodplain.
There were two houses at Mound C, the smaller one ( 14 feet in diameter) superimposed over the larger one ( 18 feet in diameter). Each
apparently had a centrally located hearth and one, or possibly both, had
an extended entranceway on the west side. Two interior roof support
molds were related to the earlier house, but none were found for the
later one.
Beneath Mound D was a single house with traces of an interior hearth
situated near the center and an extended entranceway on the west side.
Instead of being built directly on the surface of the floodplain as were
the houses at Mounds B and C, the house at Mound D had been built in
a shallow excavated pit.
Underneath each of the interior hearths associated with the houses at
Mounds B and C was a relatively large post mold. It is uncertain
whether there was a similar post mold at Mound D because the large
pothole there had removed the central portion of the house floor, including the hearth. These molds at Mounds B and C apparently mark the
locations of center posts which were used as work platforms during construction of the houses and then removed after the houses were completed. Ridges of sand around the perimeters of all the houses seem to
have been banked against the exterior walls while the houses were
standing. The floodplain between and around the mounds was tested
by pitting and trenching, but no occupational features or concentrations
of cultural material were found away from the mounds.
Circular houses of the same general architecture as those at the Harroun Site are typical of the Caddoan Area, especially during the Fulton
Aspect period (Webb, 1940; Harrington, 1920; Newell and Krieger,
1949; Goldschmidt, 1935; Davis, 1958). Harrington ( 1920) reported

55

several circular houses with extended entranceways found beneath sand
mounds one to three feet high in southwestern Arkansas. Some of these
houses had been built on the surface of the ground, some had been built
in shallow pits, and others had been placed on low mounds. Most of
them had been burned, and all were associated with typically Caddoan
artifacts and with burned clay daub. Harrington thought the houses
were earth lodges which had burned and collapsed, the earth from the
walls and roofs falling over the house floors so as to form mounds. Webb
( 1940) reported architecturally similar houses at the Belcher Site in
northwestern Louisiana, but presented a strong argument that they were
wattle-and-daub houses and not earth lodges.
It appears certain that the Harroun houses were also wattle-and-daub
structures without any covering of earth. This conclusion is based on the
following points:
1. The bodies of the mounds were composed of soft sand entirely
unsuited for covering the sides and roofs of houses. It is doubtful if sand
of this consistency would stick to a vertical or steeply sloping wall at all;
but even if it did, it would surely be washed away with the first heavy
rain.
2. The central portions of the Harroun mounds stood from two to
three feet above the floors of the houses. If all this sand had fallen in
from the tops of earth lodges, then the lodges must originally have had
sand piled at least two or three feet thick on the middle of their roofs.
This does not seem probable.
3. Fragments of burned, wattle-impressed, clay daub at all the Harroun houses indicate that the houses were plastered with clay, presumably on the outside. Burned clay daub apparently does not occur
archeologically in association with true earth lodges in the plains.
4. Remains of true earth lodges in the Plains area show superficially
as depressions, often with a low ring-shaped mound around the perimeter (Wedel, 1936: 24; Lehmer, 1954). Sometimes the depressions result
in part from the shallow pits in which the lodges were built. But even
when an earth lodge was built directly on a flat surface rather than in a
pit, the mound left behind when the lodge collapsed has a concavity in
the center instead of being convex as were the mounds at the Harroun
Site. It is significant that Mound D was prominent and convex in shape
even though the house it covered had been built in a pit. Certainly it is

difficult to visualize an earth lodge-whether built in a pit or notcollapsing in such a manner as to produce a smoothly convex mound
like those at the Harroun Site.
In view of the foregoing factors, it is concluded that Mounds B, C,
and D at the Harroun Site were purposely erected over the ruins of the
burned houses.
It appears certain that the four houses at the Harroun Site were typical Caddoan houses. Perhaps they were of the traditional "beehive"
shape, or possibly they had wattle-and-daub walls and thatched roofs
like those photographed by Soule about 1870 and pictured in Webb
( 1940: Pl. 8, 1 ) .
Historical descriptions and sketches of Caddoan houses indicate that
they did not usually have extended, covered entranceways as do a majority of the prehistoric houses that have been excavated in the Caddoan
Area. This suggests that the extended entranceway was used at a relatively early period but was abandoned prior to the 17th century. However, Caddoan houses of the early historic period will have to be excavated before a definite statement can be made in this regard.
Ceramics at the Harroun Site consisted mainly of brushed, incised, engraved, and appliqued styles, including types Ripley Engraved, Taylor
Engraved, Bullard Brushed, Pease Brushed-Incised, and Maydelle Incised. One sherd of Crockett Curvilinear Incised was also found, and
two other sherds are similar to the types Coles Creek Incised (or Chase
Incised) and Beldeau Incised. Ripley, Taylor, Bullard, and Maydelle
are all indigenous types of the Titus Focus ( Suhm et al., 1954: 192),
Ripley in particular being considered diagnostic of the focus. Beldeau
Incised and Coles Creek Incised are Lower Mississippi types and they
are surely intrusive in the site. Both were buried between 2.5 and 4.0
feet deep in the floodplain (but at different locations) and they may
pre-date the mounds. The sherd of Crockett Curvilinear Incised came
from a disturbed area at Mound B, but four sherds from a Gibson
Aspect engraved bottle are anomalies that are apparently associated
with the mound period at Harroun.
The most common type in the small sample of arrow points is Perdiz,
generally considered to equate in time (in East Texas) with the Fulton
Aspect, but usually thought of as a trait of the Frankston Focus-not
the Titus Focus. Dart point types Gary, Ellis, and Wells-all found at

57

the Harroun Site-are widely distributed in East Texas, and any or all
of these types could be affiliates of the Titus Focus or related complexes,
although such associations have not been previously demonstrated. The
few miscellaneous stone artifacts are relatively non-distinctive in form.
The Titus Focus has been defined on the basis of data derived almost
entirely from burials ( Suhm et al., 1954: 191). As pointed out by Davis
( 1958: 67) there is a possibility that mortuary offerings of pottery, arrow points, and other objects may represent selected items and do not
necessarily provide a complete catalog of traits actually used by the
Titus Focus people. Trait lists compiled from burial data include the
arrow point type Talco and the pottery types Ripley Engraved and
Harleton Appliqued as focus diagnostics. Other types listed as Titus
Focus traits are shared with other foci.
Davis ( 1958: 67-68) has noted that Talco points are reported by local
collectors to occur only in burials. If this is so, the absence of Talco
points in the occupation zones at Harroun does not necessarily negate
Titus Focus affiliation for the site. The Perdiz arrow point associated
with the burial, however, does seem out of character for Titus Focus as
it has been defined.
By and large, the ceramics at the Harroun Site are typical forms and
styles of the Titus Focus. However, the absence of diagnostic pottery
type Harleton Appliqued and the presence of Pease Brushed-Incised
are incongruous with previous concepts of the Titus Focus.<:> At the
Whelan Site, on Cypress Creek 15 miles below the Harroun Site, Davis
( 1958) has recently reported a series of superimposed houses within a
small mound, associated with an assemblage of artifacts remarkably
similar to those at Harroun. Ripley Engraved and Pease Brushed-Incised
were both present in significant quantities at Whelan, while Harleton
Appliqued was totally absent. No Talco arrow points were found, but
six arrow points with expanding stems and one Perdiz point were recovered. Since more than 15,000 artifacts were collected from the
Whelan Site, it adds considerable substance to the inventory of artifacts
from Harroun, and virtually eliminates any possibility that the Harroun
" The anomalous presence of two Lower Mississippi sherds and five Gibson
Aspect sherds at the Harroun Site must be considered intrusive, although a reasonable hypothesis to explain their occurrence in a site of Fulton Aspect date does not,
it must be confessed, come readily to mind.

58

inventory, because of the smallness of the sample, is not truly representative.
On a low ridge near the edge of the Cypress Creek valley, about a
half mile west of the Harroun Site, R. R. Nicholas and E. M. German
(personal communication) recently excavated several burials. They reported finding vessels of Ripley Engraved and Pease Brushed-Incised
associated in the same graves. This spot may be the location of the main
village occupation related to the Harroun mounds; in any event the
burials there confirm the association of Titus Focus and Bossier Focus
ceramic types found at the Harroun and Whelan Sites.
The traits observed at the Harroun Site indicate affiliation with the
Titus Focus, but with the following notable deviations from previous
conceptions of the focus:
1. Talco points-thought to be a diagnostic trait of Titus Focusare absent. However, Talco is alleged to occur only in burials, and consequently its absence in occupational areas is not necessarily significant.
2. Perdiz points are present, although they have not been listed as a
trait of Titus Focus.
3. Harleton Appliqued pottery-one of the two ceramic types considered diagnostic of Titus Focus-is absent. Since Harleton has been
found only in graves, however, it may be a specialized type used solely
for burial purposes.
4. Pease Brushed-Incised pottery is present in significant quantity.
Pease has been previously assigned only to the Bossier and Haley Foci,
and has been thought a bit too early for association with Titus Focus.
Its presence here may indicate that the Harroun Site dates from the
earlier part of the Titus Focus.
5. The entire artifact assemblage is directly associated with mounds.
Mounds have not previously been reported as a Titus Focus trait.
The following alternative hypotheses were advanced by Davis ( 1958:
67-68) as possible explanations of the circumstances found at the
Whelan Site. They are equally applicable to the Harroun Site.
1. The site was occupied by "classic" Titus Focus peoples whose artifacts used in every day life differed in some respects from those usually
placed in graves. If the Harroun Site served primarily for ceremonial

59

purposes as has been suggested, this might also help explain some of
the observed trait differences between it and the Titus Focus cemeteries
previously reported.
2. Occupation was by Titus Iiocus peoples, but at a slightly earlier
date than the establishment of the large cemeteries from which the
focus has been defined. Conceivably, the trait inventory of early Titus
Focus peoples may have been slightly different from that of their descendants. If a temporal factor is involved, it is assumed that the Harroun Site dates early in the sequence rather than late because of the
associated Pease Brushed-Incised pottery. There are no stratigraphic
data to support this conjecture.
3. The site was not occupied by Titus Focus peoples at all, but by
some contemporaneous group who acquired Titus Focus artifacts
through trade or by imitation.
We believe that the first and second hypotheses are most likely to be
the correct ones, with a distinct possibility that a combination of the
two may best explain the association of traits found at the Harroun Site.

6o

Conclusions
The following conclusions have been reached regarding the Harroun
Site.
I. Principal occupation was by Fulton Aspect people closely related
to-or identical to-people of the Titus Focus. There is an excellent
possibility that this is a relatively early Titus Focus site.

2. The four houses probably were used for ceremonial purposes;
ultimately each was "cremated" and buried beneath a mound of sand.
3. Mound A was for the purpose of covering Burial No. I.
4. If the above conclusions are correct, the following archeological
traits may be added to those previously recognized for the Titus Focus:
a. Mounds over human burials.
b. Mounds over burned house structures.
c. Circular houses of wattle-and-daub construction with centrally
located hearth, interior roof supports in some cases, extended
entranceway on the west or southeast side, soil banked against
the exterior wall, and a centrally located center post used during construction of the house; the houses were sometimes built
in shallow excavated pits.
d. Probable ceremonial use of the above-described houses.
e. Pottery type Pease Brushed-Incised in occupational sites.
f. Dart point type Gary in occupational sites.
g. Arrow point type Perdiz in occupational sites and in burials.
