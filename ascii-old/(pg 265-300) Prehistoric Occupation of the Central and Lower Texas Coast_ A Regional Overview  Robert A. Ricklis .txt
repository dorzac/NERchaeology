Prehistoric Occupation of the Central and Lower
Texas Coast: A Regional Overview
Robert A. Ricklis

ABSTRACT
The prehistoric human occupation of the central and lower Texas coastlines is reviewed in light of recently
acquired archeological and environmental information. Greatest attention is devoted to the central coast, which
has seen more systematic research that the lower coast. A relatively long series of radiocarbon dates is now
available for this area, permitting the development of a basic chronology of adaptive change for the long-lived
Archaic, as well as the subsequent Late Prehistoric period. The chronological data suggest that shoreline
occupation over the long term was not continuous through time, but tended to fall into three distinct time intervals
that likely correlate with the emergence of biotically rich estuaries during periods of stable Holocene sea level.
Although understanding of the chronology of occupation and adaptive changes for the lower coast is limited by
a paucity of systematic research, some important work has also been accomplished within the framework of
cultural resource management projects.

INTRODUCTION
In 1960, T. N. Campbell published an
archeological synthesis of the central and lower
coasts (Campbell 1960). At that time, it was possible
to identify, for the central Texas coast, basic Archaic
and Late Prehistoric (or, as then termed, "NeoAmerican") cultural patterns involving human
occupation of the shoreline and exploitation of
shellfish and fish resources. Chronology was strictly
relative, since no radiocarbon dates had yet been
obtained in the area, and a cultural sequence could
be defined only on the basis of the stratigraphic
positions of identifiable artifact assemblages.
Based upon previous excavations at a few key
sites such as Kent-Crane (41AS3), Johnson
(41AS1), and Live Oak Point (41AS2) on Copano
Bay, and Webb Island (41NU1) in upper Laguna
Madre, Campbell (1947, 1952, 1956, 1958a, 1960)
suggested a bipartite chronology in which an
Archaic Aransas focus preceded a Neo-American
Rockport focus. The former was characterized by
shoreline shell middens yielding a variety of stone
dart point forms (later assignable mainly to the
Kent and Ensor types as defined by Suhm and Jelks
[1962]), various bone tools, including awls and pins
with engraved geometric decorations, and a suite of
shell tool forms consisting of perforated oyster

shells, conch columella gouges, bi-pointed
columella sections, adzes cut and ground from conch
whelk body whorls, and knives/scrapers of edgeflaked sunray venus clamshells. The Aransas focus
was also negatively defined by the absence of arrow
points and ceramics.
The Rockport focus, linked with the historic
Karankawa Indians of the region (Campbell 1960),
was identified on the basis of several arrow point
types and more or less abundant sandy paste ceramics, often decorated and/or coated with asphaltum, a natural tar which washes up on Gulf of
Mexico beaches. On the basis of the virtually consistent presence of sand in ceramic clay bodies, and
the occasional use of geometric incised line decorations below vessel rims, Campbell (1961) suggested
that central coast ceramic technology diffused from
the upper Texas coast.
Subsequent work on the central coast provided
additional insight into questions of prehistoric chronology and adaptive patterns (see summary review
in Shafer and Bond 1985). Dee Ann Story’s 1967
work at two sites in the region (Story 1968) was the
first professional excavation since the earlier work
reviewed and reported by Campbell. At the Anaqua
site (41JK8) on the lower Lavaca River, Story identified an important Late Prehistoric component with
plain, sandy paste ceramics similar to upper coast

Goose Creek Plain (Suhm and Jelks 1962), in apparent association with Scallorn and Granbury
(Scallorn preforms?) arrowpoints. At the Ingleside
Cove site (41SP43) on Corpus Christi Bay, Story’s
excavations revealed stratified deposits, with a Late
Archaic shell midden overlain by a midden pertaining to the Late Prehistoric Rockport manifestation.
These excavations provided the first radiocarbon
dates for the central coast: four samples (3 scallop
shell, 1 wood charcoal) were assayed, and appeared
on the basis of uncorrected dates to place the terminal Archaic component at ca. A.D. 1100-1250 (see
Story 1968:40).
In 1974, James E. Corbin published a relative
chronology for the central coast, based mainly upon
a seriation of dart and arrow point types. For the
Archaic, he suggested that the known dart point
types were too varied, and spanned too long a time,
to fit the relatively tight temporal requirements of a
"focus" (Corbin 1974). On this basis, Corbin suggested that the term Aransas Complex was more
appropriate, since the concept of a "complex" did
not imply a clearly bounded spatial and temporal
cultural expression. In a slightly later paper, Corbin
(1976) suggested that Archaic occupation of the
coast probably began ca. 2000 B.C., with the establishment of modern sea level. For the Late Prehistoric, Corbin’s seriation suggested a chronology of
several arrow point types, with Scallorn and Fresno
preceding Perdiz, which was in turn followed during the period of European contact by the Bulbar
Stemmed type.
At the time of Campbell’s 1960 article, the
lower coast was even more poorly investigated than
was the centra! coast. The archeological record,
known primarily from sites in the Rio Grande delta
area, in fact consisted only of surface-collected artifacts which could be related in part to materials
from northern Tamaulipas, Mexico. It was recognized that a long Archaic occupation, characterized
by triangular and subtriangular dart points, preceded an Neo-American one with unstemmed arrow points and a regional shell industry. Later work
has been intermittent, and the lower coast remains
poorly known.

THE CENTRAL TEXAS COAST
The central coast, as here defined, includes the
shoreline zone (including the barrier islands), and
the coastal plain to a point approximately 40-50 km

inland from the mainland strandline, between the
Colorado River on the north and the northern margins of Baffin Bay on the south (Figure 1). The
rationale for this geographic definition is twofold.
First, this is the area of the Late Prehistoric Rockport
phase, which can be quite accurately delimited on
the basis of the distribution of a distinctive artifact
assemblage. Second, while there is internal environmental variability, the area is unified by the
presence of five similar, major bay estuarine systems protected by a continuous barrier island chain,
in contrast to the prograded Brazos-Colorado River
delta to the north and the un-embayed shoreline of
the lower coast.
The following discussion presents, first, a brief
overview of what is currently known about the evolution of the central coast as an exploitable environment. This is followed by a summary of the
current archeological data base, presented chronologically from the Early Archaic through the Late
Prehistoric, along with discussions of fundamental
long-term patterns of human adaptive change.
The Paleoindian stage is not treated here, for
two reasons. First, the period is represented along
the coast only by sporadic surface finds of timediagnostic early and late Paleoindian dart point types
(see Hester 1980a); to date, no intact subsurface
Paleoindian components have been found at excavated sites (though the reader may refer to Lewis
[1988, 1994] for discussions of a Late Pleistocene
faunal assemblage with possible evidence of human presence, on Petronila Creek southwest of Corpus Christi). Second, the scattered Paleoindian
artifacts found within the modern central coast area
do not pertain to a contemporaneous coastal occupation, since the terminal Pleistocene shoreline was
situated a considerable distance seaward of the
present coast, due to lower global sea level. When
and if intact, subsurface Paleoindian components
are found in the region, they will represent terrestrial/riverine, rather than coastal, adaptations.

The Holocene Evolution
of the Central Coast
Environment
The central coast is part of the broad Gulf
Coastal Plain (Fenneman 1938), a nearly flat
physiographic unit that rises very gradually from
the coast to the interior. The surface geology
consists of sandy clays and clayey sands deposited
by major fluvial-deltaic systems during the

Pleistocene interglacials. The most recent geological
unit is the Beaumont Formation, a thick
accumulation of Pleistocene clays and sands that is
the geological foundation of the present coastline.
The Ingleside unit of the Beaumont is a long, narrow
deposit of sandy clays, representing a Pleistocene
barrier or strandplain; this overlies the main part of
the Beaumont Formation along the modern
strandline (Brown et al. 1976; Solis 1981).
During the last glacial maximum, ca. 20,000
B.P., sea level was as much as 100 meters lower

than at present, since much of the global water
supply was locked in massive continental ice sheets
and extensive montane glaciers. At that time,
coastal streams downcut deeply into the Beaumont
Formation. After ca. 18,000 B.P., global warming
resulted in rapid sea level rise, so that by ca. 9000
B.P. the river valleys along the central Texas coast
were inundated by transgressive marine waters,
thus creating the prototypes of the modern bay
systems (Byrne 1975; Brown et al. 1976;
McGowen et al. 1976).

Although there is not complete agreement on
the timing of Hotocene sea level rise, there is a
general consensus that marine transgression was
stepwise, with periods of rapid rise interrupted by
intervals of markedly slowed rise, slight regression,
or sea level stillstand (Curray 1960; Nelson and
Bray 1970; Frazier 1974; Paine 1991; Anderson
and Thomas 1991). The more recent geologic studies have suggested that sea level rose relatively
rapidly prior to 9000-8000 B.P., and then between
7000 and 6000 B.P. (Frazier 1974; Paine 1991).
Paine (1987, 1991) has suggested a rapid rise to an
approximately 1-meter highstand between ca. 4400
and 2600 B.P., and recent work by Anderson et al.
(1992) has suggested final rise and inundation of
river valleys ca. 4000 B.P. There is general agreement that modern stable sea level was established
around 3000 B.P., give or take a few centuries
(Frazier 1974; Brown et al. 1976; McGowen et al.
1976; Paine 1991; Anderson et al. 1992).
The modern coastal environment began to
emerge with the establishment of stillstand ca. 3000
B.P. With a stable sea level, wave action and
longshore drift deposited sand and shell offshore,
and disconnected Middle Holocene transgressive
barriers began to coalesce to form the modern, continuous chain of regressive barrier islands, which
probably approximated their present form by 25002000 B.P. (e.g., Brown et al. 1976). The development of the mature barrier chain created a series of
highly protected lagoons and estuarine embayments,
and ongoing sedimentation resulted in the extensive back-barrier shallows of the modern estuarine
environment. The emergence of broad, quiet-water
shallows played a key role in estuarine ecology,
since vegetated shallows and marshes provide important nutrients for the rich aquatic food chain, as
well as crucial nursery and spawning grounds for
fish (e.g., Odum et al. 1974; Perret et al. 1980;
Reagan !985; Matlock 1990). Thus, the modern
central coast environment is characterized by highly
productive, shallow-water, estuaries protected from
the high-energy wave action of the open Gulf by a
continuous barrier chain.
The terrestrial environment is varied according
to local soil and hydrological conditions. For the
most part, the barrier islands are treeless and characterized by stabilized sand dunes which support various grasses, and are fringed on their land sides with
salt marsh plant communities. Sandy soils on the
mainland shore support dense mottes of live and
blackjack oak (Jones 1983). Farther inland are the

coastal prairies, essentially flat upland areas covered with grasses and scattered clumps of mesquite
and, on sandy soils, live oak (Jones 1983). Faunal
species include various reptiles, amphibians, mammals, and birds (see Blair 1950), and bison were
present in significant numbers on the coastal prairie
in Late Prehistoric and Early Historic times, as indicated by archeological and historical documentation
(see Ricklis 1990, !992a; Huebner 1991).

THECHRONOLOGYOFHUMAN
OCCUPATION ON THE
CENTRAL TEXASCOAST
A Brief Consideration of Taxonomy
In light of chronological data acquired in recent
years, it is apparent that the cultural history of
coastal adaptation in the region was both longer
and more complex than can be adequately
represented by a simple bi-partite chronology
involving an undifferentiated Aransas focus and a
Late Prehistoric Rockport focus. While Campbell’s
early work identified the broadest outlines of
regional chronology and described major artifact
classes, it is now clear that the Archaic occupation
of the region has far greater time depth than once
assumed, and that distinct periods of occupation
with concomitant adaptive changes would be
masked by the continued use of a single taxonomic
label for the entire Archaic period. Thus, the Aransas
focus, or as it has more recently been termed, the
Aransas complex (Corbin 1974; Shafer and Bond
1985; Steele and Mokry 1985; Prewitt et al. 1987),
should be set aside in favor of a chronological
perspective which fits the currently available
empirical evidence.
Recently, Weinstein (1992, !994) has suggested a chronology of "phases" for the central
coast. This chronological construct is not employed
here. Most of Weinstein’s phases are largely conjectural, insofar as distinctive artifact assemblages
remain poorly defined and/or cannot be placed
within definable temporal or geographic limits on
the basis of the available archeological evidence. In
some cases, entire phases are based only on a single
projectile point type which has yet to be found in a
securely dated context. As Johnson (1987) has correctly pointed out, a "phase" must represent, at the
very least, a well-defined spatial-temporal unit of
archeological culture and, at best, a strongly inferred sociocultural entity. At present, these criteria

Rieklis ~ Prehistoric Occupation of the Central and Lower Texas Coast
can be met only by the Late Prehistoric Rockport
phase, which is geographically discrete and which
is in large part, if not entirely, the archeologica!
correlate of the ethnically and linguistically distinct
Karankawa groups who inhabited the central coast
region in Early Historic times (Newcomb 1961,
1983; Ricklis !990, in press).

Radiocarbon Dating on
the Central Coast
Most of the radiocarbon dates now available
from discrete site components in the region are
derived from assays on estuarine shell species found
within shell middens. It is, therefore, important to
point out that shell samples provide reliable results
which are useful in placing site components within
a chronological framework. This fact has been discussed elsewhere (Ricklis and Cox 1991; Ricklis
1993), and the present article is not the place for a
detailed reiteration of these findings. Suffice it to
say that paired samples of shell and wood charcoal,
when extracted from the same cultural depositional
unit or feature, produce virtually identical results,
once the radiocarbon ages on shell are corrected for
the delta ~~C fraction (Table 1, dates nos. 7-13,
which all came from a single, stratigraphically discrete deposit of densely packed shell). Similar results were recently obtained on oyster shell and
hearth charcoal samples from a discrete zone of
Late Prehistoric archeological deposits at the
Mitchell Ridge site (41GV66) on Galveston Island:
when the shell assays were corrected for ~3C, the
radiocarbon ages were statistically identical to those
obtained on the charcoal samples (Ricklis
1994a: 107). To such specific results in paired charcoal-shell samples can be added the fact that multiple dates on shel! samples from within stratified
depositional sequences produce internally consistent results.
All radiocarbon dates from the central coast
that can be determined with confidence to have
come from stratigraphically discrete contexts are
shown in Table 1. The radiocarbon data are additionally reflected in Table 2, which lists discrete
stratigraphic components at shoreline sites and
shows their age ranges as indicated by one or more
corrected and calibrated radiocarbon assays. These
data do not include three early dates from possibly
mixed stratigraphic contexts: two dates on shell
from 41JK35, repol~ed by Weinstein, were extracted

269

from 10 cm arbitrary levels which may have crosscut more than a single stratigraphic zone (Weinstein
1994:159-t60); the third date comes from a handexcavated test unit at 41NU266 on Nueces Bay,
where there is some reason to believe that shells
from the oldest stratigraphic component were mixed
with materials from an overlying stratum (Ricklis
1995a). Because of the uncertain contexts of these
dates, they are not listed in Table 1 or incorporated
into the following discussion. Unless otherwise indicated, all radiocarbon age ranges on shell presented below are corrected for the ~3C fraction and
dendrochronologically calibrated at 1-sigma of error. Since charcoal dates are not significantly altered by ~3C correction, they have been calibrated
directly from the uncorrected assay results.

THE EARLY ARCHAIC
The earliest demonstrable human occupation
and exploitation of the central coast shoreline, as
noted above, can now be placed considerably earlier than once assumed. Numerous sites are currently assignable to the Early Archaic period, prior
to the establishment of modern sea level stillstand
and the emergence of the modem estuarine environment. Two major periods of Early Archaic occupation are indicated: ca. 7500-6800 B.P., and ca.
5800-4200 B.P.

Evidence for Shoreline Occupation,
ca. 7500-6800 B.P.
Occupation during this time interval is well
established on the basis of radiocarbon dates on
discrete stratigraphic components at several sites in
the Nueces Bay area (Figure 2). Cultural components consist of thin but dense lenses or strata of
oyster shells (Crassostrea virginica), resting at the
base of Holocene silty cumulic soils which rest
unconformably on eroded surfaces of the Pleistocene Beaumont Formation (Figures 3 and 4). At
41SP136 and 41SP153, both situated on upland
margins overlooking the north shore of Nueces
Bay, three corrected and calibrated age ranges on
oyster shell and one on scallop shell fal! into this
period (see Tables 1 and 2). At a third site,
41NU266 on the uplands overlooking the south
shore of Nueces Bay, similar oyster strata at several different locations produced age ranges falling

between 7381 and 6737 B.P. (Warren 1993; Ricklis
1995a; Table 1 herein). Finally, an oyster shell
midden at 41NU281, exposed by construction activities on the uplands overlooking the Nueces
River delta, produced an age range of 7525-7390
B.P. (Ricklis 1995b).
Aside from the fact that estuarine shellfish were
obviously exploited, very little is known of this
period. Excavations have been too limited to
produce much useful archeological information. A
scant amount of chert debitage and a chert core
from 41SP153, and a few utilized flakes from
41NU266, are the only lithic artifacts documented
from excavated components of the period. However,
surface finds of Early Archaic points resembling
the Uvalde type (Figure 5), and an excavated
specimen of the Gower type from 41SP154 on
Nueces Bay (found in a somewhat later component
where it may represent re-use and subsequent loss/
discard [Ricklis 1993:33-36]), may eventually prove
to pertain to this early period. Interestingly, the
edge-flaked sunray venus clamshell knife/scraper,
common at later sites (Figure 6), is now well
documented for this period. Two specimens were
recovered at 41SP153 in unquestionable context

within the earliest basal shell stratum there (Ricklis
1993), and a third specimen was recently excavated
from within a discrete dense Early Archaic oyster
stratum at 41NU266 (Ricklis 1995a).
Aside from shellfish (mainly oysters), faunal
remains are almost entirely lacking from Early
Archaic components. Probably, this is in large part
the result of the complete decay of bone. On the
other hand, fish otoliths, which are remarkably
resistant to decay in the silty soils of the area, are
nearly absent; the only specimen, representing a
spotted seatrout, comes from 41NU266 (Ricklis
1995a). Fishing may not yet have played a
significant role in the subsistence economy. This is
an important question which will be addressed only
by extensive future excavations of site components
of the period.

Shoreline occupation,
ca. 5800-4200 B.P.
Better documentation is available for this period of Early Archaic coastal occupation, although
much important work remains to be done. Sites are
considerably more numerous than for the previous

part of the Early Archaic period. As of this writing, 15 discrete stratigraphic components can be
assigned to the latter part of the Early Archaic
period on the basis of 24 individual radiocarbon
assays (see Tables 1 and 2, and Figure 7). Sites
include: 41NU184 (Ricklis and Gunter 1986),
41NU221 (Ricklis 1988), 41NU266 (Warren
1993; Ricklis 1995a), and 41NU267 (Ricklis
1995a), all along the lower Nueces River/delta;
several sites on the northern shore of Nueces Bay
(41SP15, 41SP136, 41SP148, 41SP153, and
41SP156 [Ricklis 1993; Ricklis and Cox 1991]);
one site (41KL71) on the north shore of Baffin
Bay (Smith 1984); an early component at
41SP120 on Ingleside Cove (Ricklis 1993); and
the basal shell stratum at 41JK24, overlooking
the Lavaca River delta (Weinstein 1994).
All components of this period are once again
more or less thin (5-25 cm thick) shell deposits,
usually consisting of oyster (though brackish-water Rangia flexuosa shells predominate in what
were probably more river-influenced areas at
41NU184 and 41NU221). Artifacts are not abundant, and some sites have produced only shells
and occasional chert flakes and fish otoliths.
However, there is some variability in both thickness of deposits and density of artifacts, which
suggests an as yet poorly understood, corresponding variability in the intensity and/or duration of occupations along the central coast. At the
McKinzie site (41NU221), for example, a fairly
extensive and relatively thick (15-20 cm) shell
deposit, with three radiocarbon age ranges falling between 5919 and 5336 B.P., yielded hundreds of chert flakes, utilized flakes, a chert
end-side scraper, and five chert dart points (2
Bell, 1 Early Triangular, 1 Tortugas, and 1
unstemmed, rounded-base form). This component also produced two shell implements, one a
perforated oyster shell, the other an edge-modified oyster shell (Ricklis 1988).
Although relatively extensive excavations
(24 m2 units) at the Means site (41NU184) produced only chert debitage, at least a dozen Early
Triangular dart points (see Turner and Hester
1993) have been surface collected from that part
of the site where a dense Rangiaflexuosa midden
was exposed by cultivation. This site also produced a post mold pattern representing a small
arc-shaped hut wall or windbreak, 3.2 meters
across (Ricklis and Gunter 1986). A cluster of
Rangia flexuosa, possibly associated with the

Ricklis m Prehistoric Occupation of the Central and Lower Texas Coast

structure, yielded a corrected and calibrated age
range of 5592-5325 B.P.
Several artifacts, in addition to chert debitage,
were recovered from a discrete shell stratum at
41SP 156 on the north shore of Nueces Bay (Ricklis
1993), with age ranges spanning the time interval
between 5592 and 4614 B.P. A Gower point from
this stratum, mentioned above, may predate the
dated shell deposit, although its position securely
embedded within dense shell suggests it was
(re)used by the people responsible for deposition of
the shells. The distinctive barb section of an Andice
point (see Figure 5f) probably pertains to this stratum; while it was found on the surface of a machine
cut which transected the site, it appeared to have
eroded from the dated shell stratum.

277

Chert debitage and an Early Triangular dart
point (see Figure 5h) were excavated from deep
colluvial sol! at 4!NU267 near the south shore of
Nueces Bay. The level which produced the Early
Triangular point also contained oyster shells yielding a corrected and calibrated radiocarbon age range
of 4986-4862 B.P. (Ricklis 1995a). Finally, a Bell
dart point from the Swan Lake site (41AS16), although collected from the surface, is believed to
have eroded from a wave-reworked Early Archaic
shell midden at that site (Prewitt et al. 1987; Prewitt
and Paine 1988).
Limited subsistence data are available for this
time period. Fish otoliths have been recovered from
several site components (41NU184, 41NU221,
41NU267, 41SP156, and 41SP148). Species

represented are black drum (Pogonias cromis),
spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus), redfish
(Sciaenops ocellata), Atlantic croaker (Micropogon
undulatus) and catfish (Aureusfelis?). Though not
abundant at any site (the largest n=32, is from the
McKinzie site [41NU221]), it is clear that
procurement of estuarine fish was part of the
subsistence economy by this time. Although
relevant deposits are generally still too old to contain
preserved bone, it can be assumed that hunting was
carried out, since dart points are present. At
41NU267, faunal bone was preserved within welldrained, colluviat fine sand, and bones of fish, deer
and rodents were recovered using fine-mesh screens
(Ricklis 1995a).
There are some limited seasonality data available for this period as well. Seasonality analysis of
oyster shells from several sites on the north shore
of Nueces Bay suggest that most shellfish gathering took place in the winter through early spring
(Cox and Cox 1993; Cox 1994). Since this time of
year, when plant foods were scarce and game was
low in body fat, would have been potentially stressful for prehistoric hunter-gatherers, shellfish may
have served as an important seasonal "back-up"
source of calories and protein. Seasonality analysis
of fish otoliths from the McKinzie site (Ricklis
1988) suggests that fishing was carried out mainly
in the fall through winter/early spring.
The increased number of sites during this time
interval may indicate an overall growth in population, in keeping with a postulated population increase in much of Texas during the Archaic period
(Story 1985). However, it should be noted that
most of the components of both Early Archaic periods rest on an eroded Beaumont (Pleistocene)
surface, and that much evidence for the earlier of
the two periods may simply have been removed by
Early to Middle Holocene erosion. Future
geoarcheological research, designed to place occupations within the context of a dynamically changing terrestrial landscape, will be required for a firm
understanding of long-term relative population
trends in the region.

THE MIDDLE ARCHAIC: AN
APPARENT HIATUS IN SHORELINE
OCCUPATION

One of the striking characteristics of the available radiocarbon data is a virtual lack of dense shell

deposits dating to the interval between ca. 4200 and
3100 B.P. (see Figure 7). This probably is not the
result of a sampling bias, since the lack of dates is
directly reflected in the actual physical stratigraphies at various sites, where physical evidence for
occupation between strata dated to before 4200
B.P. and after 3100 B.P. is not present. Occupational strata have been identified within intact,
cumulic soil profiles at 23 sites (producing a combined total of 47 discrete, radiocarbon-dated strata),
yet no single component falls into the time interval
in question (see Table 2). The sole possible exception is a light scatter of oyster shell at the bottom
of 41SP177 on the north shore of Nueces Bay, with
oyster shells dated to an age range of 3835-3643
B.P. (Ricklis 1993:36-44). However, the sparse
shell rests within a well-sorted massive deposit of
fine sand which may represent an old beachline,
since the site is within 1.2 meter of modern sea
level. Thus, the dated oyster shells may have been
deposited naturally. Even if the shells represent
human activity, occupation must have been quite
ephemeral, judging by the absence of artifacts and
faunal bone, both of which are abundant higher in
the deposit, where far more abundant oyster shell
has yielded an age range of 3156-2843 B.P.
Future research should be conducted with an
eye to locating components dating to between 4200
and 3100 B.P. However, even if such are found, the
present data base is sufficiently large to suggest
that they will be few relative to the numerous site
components dating earlier and later in time. This
time interval appears to have seen relatively little
occupation of the shoreline, the ecological implications of which are discussed further on.

THE LATE ARCHAIC, ca. 3100-950 B.P.
The beginning of the Late Archaic on the central coast, as here defined, corresponds to the approximate time at which sea level stabilized at its
modern position, ca. 3000 B.P. Beginning at about
this date, there is a continuous series of radiocarbon-dated site components at shoreline locations
(see Tables 1 and 2 and Figure 7). Major sites are
considerably larger than the known sites of the Early
Archaic, have thicker middens, and yield a greater
range and quantity of artifacts, all of which suggests more frequent and/or intensive occupations
than previously, and perhaps a higher regional population density.

Ricklis ~ Prehistoric Occupation of the Central and Lower Texas Coast
There is evidence for a significant
intensification of estuarine resource use during the
two millennia of the Late Archaic, a trend probably
keyed to increasing biotic productivity in coastal
estuaries. Beginning ca. 3000 B.P., shellfish
gathering appears to have become, once again, a
more or less important subsistence activity. Faunal
preservation is generally good for the Late Archaic,
and it is clear that fishing was carried out, along
with hunting of game, most significantly whitetailed deer. By ca. 2000 B.P., there was a marked
increase in the importance of fishing, as indicated
by dramatic increases in the numbers of fish otoliths
and bones per unit volume of midden deposit.
The largest investigated sites of the Late Archaic are located near the seaward ends of bays.
The Kent-Crane site (41AS3), on the eastern margin of Copano Bay (see Figure 2), extends along
the top of a shoreline bluff for nearly 1 kin. This
site consists of a massive and dense shell midden
containing shells of a variety of moderate-to-high
salinity mollusks; the most common species are
oyster, scallop, sunray venus (Macrocallista
nirnbosa), quahog (Mercenaria campechensis), and
lightning whelk. At the time of the site’s original
excavation in the early 1940s, the midden was in
places as much as 1.8 meters thick (Campbell
1952). During recent testing, a sample of quahog
shell was extracted from the base of the midden for
radiocarbon dating. This produced an uncorrected
age of 2210 + 60 years (Cox and Smith 1989),
which corrects and calibrates to a 1-sigma age
range of 2773-2740 B.P. (Ricklis and Cox 1991).
Since this dates the very bottom of the midden, it
can be postulated that the site saw initial occupation at this time.
The Mustang Lake Site (41CL3; see Figure 2)
is located on the mainland shore of Mustang Lake,
a small lagoon separated from San Antonio Bay by
Late Holocene spit accretion under conditions of
modern, stable sea level. Recent survey and testing
here (Ricklis 1994b) showed that a dense oyster
shell midden extended along the shoreline for approximately 2 kin. Testing under the author’s direction in 1988 and again in !994 revealed a very
dense shell deposit with a thickness of 1.3 meters.
Shell, bone, and lithic artifacts were found throughout the deposit, but sandy paste pottery sherds were
present only in the top 20 cm. A radiocarbon date
from the base of the midden indicates that initial
occupation began at the same time as at Kent-Crane:
shells from the basal level produced an age range

279

of 2764-2727 B.P. Four other radiocarbon assays
on samples from various excavation levels show
that the midden continued to accumulate at a more
or less constant rate until at least ca. 1400 B.P.
(Figure 8). However, the presence of a Scallorn
arrow point in the 10-20 cm level suggests that
occupation actually continued somewhat later, since
the type dates to ca. 1250-600 B.P. in Texas (Prewitt
1981, 1985; Turner and Hester 1993). The Scallorn
point and sandy paste potsherds may have been
associated with Rangia cuneata clamshells which
were most abundant in the top 10 cm, and which
are, as yet, undated.
One of the most extensive and productive
known locales of Late Archaic occupation is at
Ingleside Cove on the northeastern shore of Corpus
Christi Bay. Two sites have been reported here,
41SP43 (Story 1968; Ricklis 1990, in press), and
41SP120 (Ricklis 1988, 1990, 1993, in press). These
sites (see Figure 2) were actually parts of a single
continuous cultural deposit which extended for several hundred meters along the top of the bluff overlooking the shoreline, prior to segmentation by
modern residential construction. At both 41SP43
and 41SP120, dense Late Archaic shell middens
rest within a fine sand cumulic soil (Figure 9). The

most abundant shell species are oyster, scallop,
lightning whelk, quahog, sunray venus, and crossbarred venus (Chione cancellata). Overlying the
Late Archaic shell deposits at both sites is an extensive deposit of Late Prehistoric cultural materials.
Fish bones and otoliths have been found in profusion in both Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric components; the most common species are black drum,
redfish, spotted seatrout, and Atlantic croaker. Also
present are bones of white-tailed deer and, less
commonly, other mammals and birds (see Story
1968; Ricklis 1990, in press). A relatively long list
of radiocarbon dates (8 from 41SP43 and 14 from
41SP120) clearly indicates that the major occupation of the sites began shortly after 2000 B.P.

stratigraphically discrete deposit of particularly
dense shell at 41SP120, is securely dated to ca. 950
B.P. (A.D. 1000) on the basis of seven radiocarbon
assays (3 charcoal and 4 shell) with 1-sigma age
ranges spanning the time interval between 1161
and 743 B.P. (and with six of the seven calibrated
intercept points clustering tightly between 943 and
915 B.P.). Four Late Archaic dart points (2 Catan
and 2 Matamoros) were found resting within the
dated deposit (Figure 10); arrow points were absent.

41SP120, dated to ca. A.D. 1000: a-b, Catan points; c-d,
Matamoros points.

Figure 9. Dense Late Archaic shell midden
at 41SP120 on Ingleside Cove, Corpus
Christi Bay.

The earliest Late Archaic occupation evidenced
at Ingleside Cove is represented by a thin but
stratigraphically discrete lens of oyster and quahog
shell at 41SP120 (Ricklis and Cox 1991). This lens
was found near the base of the cumulic sandy soil
at a depth of 1 m, and produced a corrected and
calibrated radiocarbon age range on quahog shells
of 3157-2948 B.P. Higher in the soil, usually at
depths ranging between 30 and 80 cm, are dense
shell midden deposits which, on the basis of 18
radiocarbon assays, place the main Late Archaic
occupation in the first millennium A.D. (see Table
2). The terminal Archaic, represented by a

Subsistence patterns during the Late Archaic
involved a dramatic increase in fishing ca. 2000
B.P. This trend is best indicated by the relative
abundances of otoliths in midden deposits, since
otoliths are resistant to decay under most conditions and thus will not be under-represented for
early time periods. As may be seen in Figure 11,
the numbers of otoliths per cubic meter of excavated deposit in the Corpus Christi Bay area shows
a dramatic increase after ca. 2000 B.P. Similarly, in
the thick midden at Mustang Lake on San Antonio
Bay, otoliths show by far the greatest abundance in
the upper 60 cm; radiocarbon dating of shells from
the 55-60 cm level produced an age range of 23032052 B.P. (Figure 12).
The increased economic importance of fishing
at this time can probably be linked to the emergence of the modern estuarine environment. After
the attainment of modern stable sea level ca. 3000

B.P., continuous barrier islands formed, seemingly
reaching essentially their modern configuration ca.
2500-2000 B.P. Concomitantly, broad back-barrier
vegetated shallows emerged, providing extensive
spawning/nursery grounds for the economically important fish species which have historically
abounded in central coast bays and lagoons (e.g.,
Perret et al. 1980; Reagan 1985; Matlock 1990;
Sutter et al. 1986; Lorrio and Perret 1980). The
emergence of such broad, vegetated shallows led to
a considerable increase in estuarine fish carrying
capacity, and human populations shifted to greater
economic focus on fish procurement.
There is some evidence to suggest that major
shoreline fishing camps such as 41SP120 and Mustang Lake were most intensively occupied during
the fall through winter/early spring as part of a
basic settlement pattern involving cool-weather
shoreline occupation and warm-season riverine
hunting camps. This pattern, better documented for
the Late Prehistoric period, is discussed below.
The Late Archaic artifact assemblage consists
of a rather wide array of items of stone, bone, and
shell. Severa! types of flaked stone dart points pertain to the period (Figure 13). At the Kent-Crane
site, most dart points can be assigned to either the
Kent or Ensor types, and an examination of the
information presented by Campbell (1952) indicates that Kent points are more commonly found in
the lower part of the midden, while Ensor points
are better represented in the upper part. Since the
base of the midden dates to ca. 2700 B.P., the Kent
points fall at or somewhat later than that date. Kent
points (and one specimen each of the Godley and
Marcos types), were found eroding from the oyster
midden at 41SP177, which produced a calibrated
age range of 3156-2873 B.P. The Ensor points at
Kent-Crane are presumably contemporaneous with
specimens from Central Texas, dated between ca.
1750 and 1400 B.P. (Prewitt 1981, 1985). Small,
thick, unstemmed dart points assignable to the Catan
and Matamoros types (see Figure 10) are well-dated
to ca. 950 B.P. at 41SP120, and presumably these
types are representative of the terminal Archaic
period in the region. There is no hard evidence to
indicate, as sometimes suggested, that these types
persisted into the Late Prehistoric period. Other
lithic items (e.g., knives, scrapers, Clear Fork
gouges, and Olmos Bifaces [see Turner and Hester
1993]) are known from probable Late Archaic contexts (e.g., Campbell 1947, 1952; Story 1968; Steele

Texas Archeological Society

282

and Mokry 1985), but are never abundant, most
likely because shell was used as a surrogate tool
material at shoreline sites, which were at considerable distances from riverine chert sources (see discussion in Ricklis and Cox 1993).
The shell tool industry during the Late Archaic shows a fair degree of diversity. Perforated
oyster shells and edge-flaked sunray venus
clamshell knives/scrapers, documented for the Early
Archaic, continued to be made. A range of conch
shell tools, on the other hand, seems to appear only
during the Late Archaic (Early Archaic sites have
yet to produce conch tools or conch fragments which
could be interpreted as tool-manufacturing debris).
Adzes (Figure 14) were manufactured from body
whorls of large lightning whelks (see Mokry 1980).
Bi-pointed conch columellae, or central spires, are
quite common in Late Archaic deposits (Campbell
1952; Story 1968; Ricklis 1990); these may be awls
or perforators, or perhaps were used as fishing gear
(i.e., spear points or gorges). Conch shells were
used as hammers (Figure 15a), and gouges (Figure
15b-c) were fashioned from the stout columellae of
large lightning whelks and Florida Horse conches
(Pleuroploca gigantea).

B

Bone artifacts (Figure 16) are well documented
for the Late Archaic. Awls were made from deer
long bone splinters and ulnas, and deer ulnas were
also used as possible flint-flaking tools (e.g., Corbin
1963; Hester 1980b: 121). Bone pins with engraved
geometric designs are documented from several

As a final note concerning the Late Archaic,
it should be mentioned that cemeteries are present,
perhaps for the first time in the region. As discussed elsewhere (Story 1985; Hall 1995), the use
of cemeteries may have accompanied the emergence of well-defined group territories, a systemic
response to growing regional population density.
The cemeteries known from the coast range in size
from a few clustered interments to large cemetery
sites containing the remains of hundreds of individuals. Unfortunately, radiocarbon dates are not
available from cemeteries which were clearly used
by coastal populations; several dates were obtained
on burials at the Blue Bayou Site (41VT94), but
stable isotope analysis on human bone suggested
that the population subsisted on a non-coastal diet
(Huebner and Comuzzie 1991).
Limited bioarcheological analyses have been
carried out on skeletal samples from the central
coast. Late Archaic/Late Prehistoric populations
were relatively tall and robust for Native Americans (Comuzzie et al. 1986; Powell 1989), which
are physical characteristics generally attributed to
the Early Historic Karankawa Indians of the region. An examination of skeletal material from
41NU2 on Oso Bay at Corpus Christi showed that
approximately 24 percent of the burial population
had suffered from endemic treponematosis, a
chronic condition which may have been transmitted to such a large proportion of the population
during periods of seasonal group aggregation (Jackson et al. 1986).

THE LATE PREHISTORIC, ca. 950-250
B.P. (A.D. 1000-1700)
There is clear evidence for the use of basketry
in the Late Archaic in the central coast. Basketryimpressed burned clay nodules have been recovered at the Tucker site (41NU46) near Corpus
Christi, from a stratum with hearth charcoal dated
to ca. 3000 B.P. (Smith n.d.; three charcoal dates
from this stratum are listed in Table 1: no. 40-42).
Fragments of asphaltum with basket impressions
are reported from the Johnson and Kent-Crane sites
on Copano Bay (Campbell 1947, 1952; Cox and
Smith 1989), from the Late Archaic midden at
41SP120 (Ricklis 1990), and from the preceramic
levels of the midden at Mustang Lake (Ricklis
1994b). In all cases, baskets appear to have been
woven using a basic twinning technique.

Several changes mark the beginning of the
Late Prehistoric period. As elsewhere in Texas
(Suhm et al. 1954; Hester 1975, 1980b; Prewitt
1981, 1985), relatively thick and heavy stone dart
points give way to light, thin arrow points, signaling the replacement of the dart and atlatl by the
bow and arrow. Ceramics, although possibly in very
limited use in the terminal Archaic (see Ricklis and
Cox 1991), become common during this period. On
the basis of changes in major artifact form/types, as
well as probable shifts in subsistence patterns, the
Late Prehistoric can be divided into two subperiods
(discussed below chronologically in terms of calendar years, due to temporal proximity to the Early
Historic period).

284

Texas Archeological Society

THE INITIAL LATE PREHISTORIC,
A.D. 1000-1250/1300
The beginning date for this period is based on
findings at 41SP120, where the terminal Archaic is
well-dated to ca. A.D. 1000, and an initial Late
Prehistoric component has produced two dates on
shells, from a discrete stratigraphic unit, with calibrated ages of 928-738 and 926-741 B.P., or A.D.
1022-1212 and A.D. 1024-1209 (Ricklis 1993:51).
Profuse fish bones and ototiths were found in association with the dated shells, as were a number of
triangular arrow points morphologically assignable
to the Fresno type (Suhm and Jelks 1962; Turner
and Hester 1993; Figure 17). Scattered fragments
of deer bone indicate some importance for hunting
at this time.
In the northern part of the central coast region,
the side/corner-notched Scallorn arrow point type
(Figure 18d) appears to mark this time period.
Scallorn points have been recovered at Mustang
Lake (41CL3) (Ricklis 1994b) and 41CL2
(Weinstein 1992) in the San Antonio Bay area, and
in abundance at the Kendrick’s Hill site (41JK35;
Weinstein 1994, and 1994 personal communica-

tion) and the Anaqua site (41JK8; Story 1968),
both on the lower Lavaca River estuary. At Anaqua,
the Scallorn points were apparently in association
with plain, sandy paste pottery.

central coast: a, Alba-like; b, Starr, c, Bulbar stemmed; d,
Scallorn. A-c are from 41SP120; d is from the Mustang
Lake site (41CL3).

Ceramics seem to have undergone a discernible, intra-regional evolution. Weinstein (1992:94)
suggests that plain, sandy paste pottery similar to
the Goose Creek ceramics of the upper Texas coast
are earlier than asphaltum-coated/decorated ceramics. As already mentioned, this kind of pottery was
found by Story (1968) at the Anaqua site in association with Scallorn arrow points, so it presumably is earlier than the asphaltum-treated Rockport
ceramics commonly associated with the later Perdiz
arrow point type. An analysis of attributes of decoration and surface treatment of Rockport ceramics
from 41SP120, according to depths within the excavated deposit, suggested in a preliminary way
that Rockport Black-on-Gray decorated wares were
somewhat later than plain pottery, and that the common vertical squiggle designs found on Rockport
pottery increased in "popularity" with time (Ricklis
1990:Appendix A).

THE FINAL LATE PREHISTORIC, ca.
A.D. 1250/1300-1700

Figure 17. Fresno arrow points, 41SP120. Found in
association with shells radiocarbon dated to ca. A.D. 10001250.

Beginning around A.D. 1250 or 1300, a distinctive artifact assemblage emerges on the central
coast. The diagnostic traits of the assemblage are a
lithic industry consisting of arrow points, mainly of

Ricklis -- Prehistoric Occupation of the Central and Lower Texas Coast
the Perdiz type (Figure 19), small unifacial end
scrapers, thin bifacial knives which are sometimes
alternately beveled, small elongate cheg drills, and
a prismatic blade-core technology (Figure 20). Ceramics include bowls, jars, and constricted-neck
ollas, often coated and/or decorated with asphaltum
(Figure 21d-h). Other kinds of decoration include
geometric incised designs below rim exteriors
(Rockport Incised [see Figure 2 t a-b), and lip modification in the form of neatly executed square
notches which give a crenelated effect to vessel
rims (see Figure 21c). Cylindrical ceramic smoking
pipes, sometimes bearing asphaltum decoration, are
also present. Additionally, Rockport phase components have produced bone artifacts such as points,
awls, deer ulna flaking tools, and small cylindrical
bird bone beads. Shell tools include edge-flaked
sunray venus clamshell knives/scrapers and whelk
shell adzes (Ricklis 1990).
Judging from the distribution of Rockport pottery, the Rockport phase can be geographically defined with a fair degree of accuracy. In a survey of
the Matagorda Bay-lower Colorado River area,
Fritz (1975) found that Rockport ware sherds, with
characteristic asphaltum surface treatment, were
common around Matagorda Bay but gave way to
plain sandy paste and/or grog-tempered ware, similar to the pottery of the upper Texas coast, in the
Colorado River delta area. The southern limit of
Rockport ware is essentially the northern shore of
Baffin Bay; several sites there have produced fairly
abundant Rockport sherds, whereas only a few
sherds have been reported from sites on the southern shore of the bay (see Hester 1969a; Smith
1984). The inland extent of Rockport pottery is

285

only about 40 km from the mainland shoreline.
Sites farther inland are invariably characterized by
a predominance of bone-tempered plainware diagnostic of the inland Toyah phase or horizon (e.g.,
the Berclair site in Goliad County [Hester and
Parker 1970], the Hinojosa site in Jim Wells
County [Black 1986], and the Burris site in
Victoria County [J. Huebner, 1989 personal communication]). Significantly, a survey along the
Aransas River in northern San Patricio County
showed that Late Prehistoric sites with Rockport

pottery, and sites with predominantly bone-tempered plainware, were both present at a point about
40 km from the mainland strandline. Similarly, at
site 41RF21 in Refugio County, also approximately
40 km from the mainland shoreline, both Rockport
and Toyah components were identified on the basis of spatially discrete concentrations of Rockport
and bone-tempered ptainware sherds (Ricklis 1989,
1990, in press).
In terms of adaptive patterns, it is clear that
fishing continued to be of major importance during the Rockport phase, since Rockport materials
have been found in association with abundant fish
remains at numerous sites (e.g., Story 1968; Smith
1984; Ricklis 1988, 1990, in press; Weinstein
1992). Major fishing camps are found on the mainland shorelines of bays and lagoons, as well as on
the landward sides of barrier islands. Fishing may
have, in fact, reached its greatest economic importance at this time, judging by the peak in fish
otolith density at 41SP120 during the Late Prehistoric (see Figure 11).
It is perhaps significant that no major, dense,
shell middens have yet to be reported for discrete
Rockport phase components. At Ingleside Cove,
Rockport phase middens were found at both
41SP120 and 41SP43 that overlie Late Archaic shell
middens; the Rockport deposits contained abundant fish remains and artifacts, but only scattered
shell debris. Similarly, at 41CL2 on Guadalupe Bay,
abundant Rockport phase materials were found to
overlie an earlier, dense shell midden (Weinstein
!992, and 1992 personal communication). Major
Rockport phase components have been identified at
the Kirchmeyer site (41NUll) on Oso Bay
(Headrick 1993), and at the Packery Channel site
(41NU219) at the north end of Padre Island (Warren 1984; author’s personal field observations),
where only scattered shell debris is present. Hypothetically, fishing may have become sufficiently
productive to render shellfish gathering a very minor subsistence activity, a possibility which merits
future investigation.
Around A.D. 1250/1300, bison hunting appears
to have become a significant subsistence activity
among central coast groups, as it did in inland Texas.
Numerous small Rockport phase hunting camps
have been documented within about 40 km of the
mainland shoreline, primarily along the uplands
overlooking stream valleys (e.g., Carlson et al. 1983;
Ricklis 1988, 1990, in press). Fish and shellfish
remains are generally scarce or absent at these sites,

where the predominant faunal remains are bones of
deer and bison. Where faunal samples are adequate
for determination of the relative importance of various taxa, bison is found to have provided the greatest bulk of useable meat weight, with white-tailed
deer as an important secondary meat source (Ricklis
1990, in press).
The repeated presence of Perdiz arrow points
at Rockport phase riverine camps with bison bone
(Ricklis 1990:281-285) suggests that these sites
date to or after ca. A.D. 1250/1300, the generally

accepted time of the appearance of the type across
much of Texas (Prewitt 1981, 1985; Mallouf 1987;
Turner and Hester 1993; Johnson 1994; Ricklis and
Collins 1995). This inference is supported by three
radiocarbon dates from the Mellon site (41RF21),
located on a tributary of Copano Creek in Refugio
County. Here, dense deposits of bison and deer
bone (Figure 22) were found in association with
Rockport ware pottery sherds and both Perdiz and
Scallorn arrow points (Ricklis 1989, 1990, in
press). Assays run on two samples of bison bone
and a sample of associated charcoal produced 1sigma calibrated age ranges of 742-660, 768-675,
and 790-576 B.P., or A.D. 1208-1290, A.D. 11821275, and A.D. 1160-1374. The respective intercept points of the three dates are A.D. 1267, 1252,
and 1265. The fact that both Scallorn and Perdiz
arrow points were found in close association with
the dated bones and charcoal suggests that Perdiz
points were quickly replacing the older Scallorn
type at this time.

Ricklis m Prehistoric Occupation of the Central and Lower Texas Coast
In fact, the Rockport phase lithic assemblage
(see Figures 19 and 20) differs little from that seen
in the contemporaneous inland Toyah phase (Prewitt
t981) or horizon (Black 1986). Perdiz is the predominant arrow point type in both assemblages, and
both assemblages contain more or less abundant
unifacial chert end scrapers, bifacial (sometimes
alternately beveled) knives, and prismatic blades
(see Hester and Shafer 1975 for a discussion of
blade-core technology in the Rockport phase). The
only difference between the two lithic assemblages
is in the respective forms of flaked stone drills or
perforators: Toyah drills are made on flakes or blades
in which the proximal end has an expanded configuration because it is left unworked, whereas Rockport
phase drills, although also made on flakes or small
blades, are elongate or cylindrical in shape. Blades
and scrapers from Rockport phase sites tend to be
smaller than many Toyah counterparts, but this probably reflects the use of small-size raw materials in a
region with limited lithic resources (see Ricklis and
Cox 1993). A similar diminution of lithic forms is
noted at the Toyah horizon Hinojosa site, where the
small size of stone tools is attributed to a local
scarcity of useable cherts (Black 1986).
The available evidence strongly suggests that
Rockport phase people were adopting most of the
items of a widespread lithic technological package,
at about the same time it appeared across much of
Texas. This seems to reflect a correlation between
the appearance of abundant bison on the coastal
prairies--part of a general and widespread increase
in bison populations in Texas (e.g., Dillehay 1974;
Huebner 1991)--and the adoption of a techno-complex well-suited to the procurement of large game
and the processing of meat and hides (cf. Hester
1975; Black 1986; Mallouf 1987; Creel 199t;
Ricklis 1992a).
Settlement and subsistence patterns during the
Rockport phase involved, to some significant degree, shifting seasonal emphases, with occupation
of shoreline fishing camps during the fall through
winter-early spring, and later spring through summer residences at hunting camps commonly located
along the upland margins of stream valleys (Ricklis
1988, 1990, 1992b, in press). Seasonality analyses
of fish otoliths from large shoreline sites (41NU11,
41SP43, 41SP120, 41CL3) place most fish deaths
in the fall through early spring, a pattern which
appears to have emerged at least as far back as the
latter part of the Late Archaic. Winter or very early
spring occupations are also suggested at 41SP120

287

and 41CL3 by seasonality analyses of oyster and
Rangia cuneata shells. Conversely, analyses of
Rangia cuneata seasonality (see Aten t981; Carlson
1988), as well as of fish otoliths, point to springsummer occupations at small prairie-riverine campsites. Additionally, it has been hypothesized that,
since the large shoreline sites are relatively few and
the small prairie-riverine sites are more numerous,
that there was a seasonal aggregation of population
at major fishing camps, and a spring-summer dispersal into smaller groups at hunting camps along
the edges of stream valleys.
This pattern had significant ecological correlates (Ricklis 1988, 1990, 1992b, in press). The
largest economically important fish species, redfish
and black drum, tend to aggregate in large numbers
during their respective fall and winter-early spring
spawning seasons, thus providing the kind of predictable and concentrated food resources required
to support relatively large human groups. On the
other hand, by mid-spring, various plant species
found along stream floodplains and upland prairies
emerged as exploitable food resources, and important game animals such as white-tailed deer and
bison increased rapidly in body weight and fat content. Since many plant foods were widely distributed across the landscape, and since game tended to
be mobile and/or dispersed, the spring-summer
camps were probably occupied for relatively short
periods of time within a more or less highly mobile
warm-season settlement pattern. Available
ethnohistoric documentation appears to support
these inferences of seasonal settlement and resourceuse strategies; archival sources suggest that the Early
Historic Karankawas resided during the fall and
winter in large shoreline camps of 400-500 or more
people, but camped along stream courses during
the spring and summer, in bands averaging about
55 individuals (Ricklis 1990, 1992b, in press).

LONG-TERM ENVIRONMENTAL AND
HUMAN ADAPTIVE CHANGE ON
THE CENTRAL COAST

It is possible to construct a model of long-term
human response to a dynamically evolving
Holocene coastline. A striking aspect of the
archeological chronology is the clustering of
radiocarbon dates from shoreline sites into the three
major periods discussed above. As was seen in
Figure 7, age ranges derived from stratigraphically

288

Texas Archeological Society

discrete occupation components cluster between
7500-6800 B.P., 5800-4200 B.P., and after 3100
B.P. The absence of dated, clearly discrete,
occupational components ca. 6800-5800 B.P. and
4200-3100 B.P. suggest two time intervals, each
lasting about a millennium, during which there was
little shoreline occupation, or at least a significant
reduction of occupation to the extent that it is not
clearly represented in the current radiocarbon
chronology. Assuming that prehistoric peoples
would exploit a rich estuarine environment when
and where it was available, we may infer that the
two intervals of reduced shoreline occupation reflect
a corresponding reduction in the exploitable biomass
of central coast estuaries.
Estuaries are one of the most productive types
of environments, rivaled in primary biotic productivity only by tropical rainforests (Odum 1971;
Whittaker 1975). They are, however, ecosystemically
fragile, insofar as high primary productivity and a
rich food chain depend on certain crucial conditions. High photosynthesis occurs in extensive, shallow sunlit waters with relatively low turbidity.
Extensive shallows are also crucial in that they supply large amounts of organic nutrients through decay of aquatic vegetation and marsh plants (Odum
et al. 1974). When the geometry of shallow-water
estuaries is significantly altered, such that the nutrient-rich shallows are destroyed or greatly reduced
in area, there are corresponding negative effects on
the biotic productivity of the entire ecosystem. On
the Texas coast, for instance, artificial destruction
of shoreline shallows has been shown to reduce
populations of shrimp--a major primary consumer
and an important link in the estuarine food chain-by 80 percent and more (Mock 1966). Similarly, it
has been documented that destruction of shoreline
salt marshes through either draining or flooding has
resulted in reductions of molluscan and crustacean
populations by as much as 90 percent (Cooper 1974).
Inundation of nutrient-rich brackish water marshes
by transgressive high-salinity waters has severe detrimental effects on brackish marsh ecosystems
(Pezeshki et al. 1987).
In light of these basic principles of estuarine
ecology, it may be highly significant that the periods of relatively intensive human shoreline occupation correspond to postulated times of relatively
stable sea level during the Holocene (Figures 23
and 24). Under stable sea level conditions, ongoing
bay-bottom sedimentation produces extensive shallows along bay margins (e.g., Dalrymple et al.

1993), of the sort conducive to high photosynthesis
and establishment of widespread shoreline vegetation communities. At the same time, deposition of
river-borne sediments creates broad, prograding deltas which support extensive and nutrient-rich
marshes. High photosynthesis rates and a rich supply of organic nutrients support high primary consumer populations (e.g., crustaceans, molluscs),
which in turn provide the ecological basis for a
high fish biomass. Additionally, the same vegetated
shallows which provide nutrients also offer ideal
conditions for fish spawning and nursery grounds
for economically important species such as black
drum, redfish, spotted seatrout, and Atlantic croaker
(Perret et al. 1980; Lorrio and Perret 1980; Reagan
1985; Matlock 1990; Sutter et al. 1986).
During times of Holocene marine transgression, when sea level may have risen three meters
or more per century (Anderson and Thomas 1991),
sea level changes would have outpaced bay sedimentation, greatly reducing the area of, if not effectively destroying, critical shoreline shallows
and deltaic marshes. Overall photosynthesis
rates would have been reduced, both by a general
deepening of bay waters and by increased turbidity, as protective barriers were breached and/or
submerged and bays became exposed to high-energy wave action from the open Gulf. Concomitantly, average salinities would have increased,

water estuaries (Odum 1971;
Whittaker 1975; Perlman 1980).
There is general agreement that
modern stable sea level was attained on the Texas coast by ca.
3000 B.P., give or take a few hundred years (Frazier 1974; Brown et
al. 1976; Paine 1991; Anderson et
al. 1992). It is almost certainly relevant that the final period of human shoreline occupation and
estuarine resource use begins at this
time, since modern sea level
stillstand resulted in the formation
of the continuous chain of barrier
islands, and the extensive shallowwater environment, which has historically been a rich source of
shellfish and fish resources. As already observed, the archeological
data strongly suggest a marked increase in fishing around 2000 B.P.,
which was probably an adaptive
response to increased fish biomass
made possible by the emergence
of highly extensive, protected shallows behind the modern barriers.
There is also a growing body
of geologic evidence which suggests a period of rapid sea level
rise just prior to the establishment
of the modem stillstand. Paine has
presented evidence for a rapid rise

rapid rise interrupted by periods of stillstand,
markedly slowed rise, or even slight reversal
(Curray 1960; Nelson and Bray 1970; Frazier 1974;
Paine 1991; Anderson et al. 1992). It can be
postulated, therefore, that the major periods of Early
Archaic occupation, ca. 7500-6800 B.P. and 58004200 B.P., correspond to times of high estuarine
biotic productivity during periods of sea level
stillstand. The apparent hiatus in occupation
between ca. 6800 and 5800 B.P. may match a period
of rapid sea level rise, since some researchers have
suggested stillstand during the eighth millennium
B.P. followed by marine transgression ca. 70006000 B.P. (Frazier 1974, as modified by Paine 199t;
see Figures 23 and 24).
While ongoing interdisciplinary studies will
help to better define the interrelations between
stepwise sea leve! rise, biotic productivity, and human adaptation, it is highly probable that the cultural history of the central coast region was keyed to
fundamental biophysical processes inherent in the
dynamic evolution of the Holocene coastline. The
region’s suitability for human occupation was seemingly not a long-term constant, but fluctuated in
response to local and regional changes which were
linked with environmental change at the global scale.

THE LOWER TEXAS COAST

The lower Texas coast (see Figure 1) can be
environmentally divided into two major subareas.
From the southern shore of Baffin Bay to the middle
of Willacy County, the coastal zone is part of the
South Texas sand sheet, an area in which Pleistocene sediments of the Beaumont Formation are
blanketed with Holocene sands, the result of deposition of surplus shoreline sand by prevailing southeasterly winds. This area, which is characterized by
a hummocky terrain of stabilized sand dunes supporting short grasses and mottes of live oak (Brown
et al. 1977), is virtually unknown archeologically.
A few poorly documented sites are recorded around
ephemeral ponds; these have produced sparse, surface-collected materials in the forms of scattered
chert debitage, occasional projectile points, lumps
of burned clay, marine shell fragments, and rare
pottery sherds (Hester 1969a; Bousman et al. 1990;
site files, Texas Archeological Research Laboratory [TARL], The University of Texas at Austin).
Paleoindian materials have been documented
at the La Paloma Mammoth site (41KN78), located

in clayey sand alluvium of the ancient Palo Blanco
River in the northwestern part of the sand sheet (R.
Suhm 1980). Several dart points, including one possibly fluted, lanceolate specimen, were found in
possible association with bones of mammoth and
Bison antiquus. Three radiocarbon assays on bone
collagen and apatite fractions date the animals to the
tenth millennium B.P. Unfortunately, the dart points
were recovered from backdirt piles, so direct association with the Pleistocene fauna is problematical.
To the south of the sand sheet is the Rio Grande
deltaic plain, a dry, subtropical area which includes
all of Cameron County, southern Willacy County,
and eastern and southern Hidalgo County (Figure
25). Several physiographic zones are included
within the area. Geologically, the mainland is comprised of both Pleistocene fluvial-deltaic sediments
and Holocene fluvi!!-deltaic sediments deposited
at the mouth of the Rio Grande. Upland vegetation
consists of various grasses, prickly pear cactus, and
clumps of mesquite, spiny hackberry, and other
thornbrush species (Johnston 1955, 1963). The area
is bounded on the south by the Rio Grande and its
modern floodplain and delta. Prior to environmenta! alterations associated with modem land-use practices, the delta area supported extensive fluvial
woodlands containing arboreal species such as elm,
ash, hackberry, mesquite, and pahnetto palms. The
mainland strandline is a complex interdigitation of
Pleistocene and Holocene fluvial-deltaic sediments,
clay dunes, and wind tidal flats. Eolian sedimentation during the Holocene deposited the shoreline
clay dunes, many of which have been shown to
contain archeological deposits (Prewitt 1974). Offshore is Padre Island, which formed between ca.
3400 and 2000 B.P., subsequent to establishment
of modern sea level stillstand. The island is virtually treeless, and is characterized by stable and
active sand dunes. Between the mainland and Padre
Island is lower Laguna Madre, a shallow-water lagoon rich in fish resources. Because the Rio Grande
discharges from a prograded deltaic lobe directly in
the Gulf of Mexico, lower Laguna Madre receives
little fresh water through stream discharge, and thus
tends toward hypersalinity and supports little in the
way of economically useful shellfish species (Brown
et al. 1980).
Archeological research in the delta area was
initiated in the first half of this century by A. E.
Anderson, an avocational archeologist who made
extensive surface collections from over 350 sites in
Cameron and Willacy counties (Anderson 1932;

to be better represented south of the

The Brownsville complex, which
may pertain largely to the Late Prehistoric period, ca. A.D. 1000 and later
(Hester 1980b: 160), is apparently confined to the area of the Rio Grande
delta. The Complex is marked by the
aforementioned shell assemblage,
small lithic tools, and unstemmed
arrowpoint types (e.g., Cameron and
Starr [see Turner and Hester 1993]).
Discrete cemeteries are known for the
Brownsville complex (Hester 1969b,
1980b).
Little is known of the antecedents
of the Brownsville complex (Mallouf

nearly devoid of other dateable materials. Finally,
recent testing at the Horse Island site (41CF29) on
the lower Laguna Madre mainland shoreline resuited in the recovery of a human burial which
produced a calibrated age range on human bone of
1352-1261 B.P. (Eling et al. 1993).
The poor understanding of areal chronology is
matched by a general lack of insight into
synchronic patterns of prehistoric resource use and
settlement patterns. Although various researchers
have noted that sites are situated in different topographical settings and environmental zones
(Prewitt 1974; Mallouf et al. 1977; Bousman et al.
1990), the relatively small number of excavations,
and only sparse data on subsistence and seasonality, provide little empirical basis for inferences
concerning intra-regional variations in subsistence
activities at different sites within different ecological zones. It seems clear from the available
ethnohistorical data that the native peoples of the
delta area subsisted by hunting, plant gathering,
and fishing (Salinas 1990), and there is nothing in
the known archeological record to suggest otherwise. Thus, it can be assumed that prehistoric
groups were more or less mobile, establishing temporary/seasonal camps within proximity to economically useful resources.
Recently, Tomka and Bousman (1990) identified several resource zones within the area (see
Figure 25), and ranked them according to biotic
productivity. These different zones are: (a) the Rio
Grande floodplain and delta, (b) the coast, (c) the
lowland plain, (d) the upland plain, and (e) the sand
sheet. Since these zones are based primarily on
assumed productivity, they differ in some ways
from earlier sets of environmental zones based
largely on geomorphic criteria (Mallouf et al. 1977;
Day et al. 1981; Hall et al. 1987).
Tomka (1990) has suggested that different resource zones would have seen variable intensity of
occupation according to the spatial concentration
and predictability of biotic resources. He presents
three alternative models of prehistoric land use,
based on assumptions that: (a) hunter-gatherers in
the area were more or less highly mobile in their
settlement and subsistence patterns, and (b) resource
zones would have been used according to the optimal availability of highly ranked food resources.
Tomka further suggested that mobility would have
operated within one of three hypothetical patterns
of group territoriality, as follows:

Groups moved about within a single large
territory. In this model, intra-areal territorial
boundaries did not exist; people moved
throughout the Rio Grande deltaic plain with
free access to any of the several resource
zones.
Rio Grande territorial groups. Here, each of
several groups operated within its own territory. Territories were elongate and parallel,
ran north-south, and each provided direct access to the Rio Grande floodplain along its
southern edge. Only the easternmost territory
provided access to the coast.
Coastal territorial groups. Again, there were
several parallel, elongate territories, but in
this case, they ran east-west, so that each
provided free access to the coast. Only the
southernmost territory included the Rio
Grande and its wooded floodplain and delta.
Tomka and Bousman (1990) attempted to test
the three models using lithic data from sites in three
of the five resource zones (the sand sheet, the upland plain, and the lowland plain). They based their
analyses on 12 lithic artifact categories, which they
postulated would be differentially distributed within
the region according to patterns of lithic material
transport that reflected movement of goods and
people according to one or another of the territoriality models. The working assumption was that,
since lithic raw material sources were found only
on the upland plain at the inland margin of the delta
region, the kinds of lithics on sites in different
locales would have to reflect established mobility
patterns, since raw material would have been unavailable in most places. Each of the 12 lithic categories was assigned an expected value for a given
resource zone, and its actual representation at a site
was then determined to be greater or lesser than the
expected value. Ideally, one of the three territorial
models would be supported when the actual values
matched those predicted according to the spatial
parameters of the model.
None of the spatial models was either clearly
confirmed or negated by the lithic data, however,
suggesting that either (a) none of the territorial models reflect the actual spatial organization of prehistoric adaptive patterns, or that (b) the distribution of
lithic materials is not a reliable indicator of prehistoric patterns of settlement and biotic resource procurement. It may be relevant to note that the

Rieklis ~ Prehistoric Occupation of the Central and Lower Texas Coast
distributions of lithic artifacts on Late Prehistoric
sites along the central Texas coast do not conform in
a patterned way to basic settlement and subsistence
patterns as defined on the basis of independent criteria; the movement of lithic materials through the
system apparently did not depend on the mobility
patterns involved in the procurement of biotic subsistence resources (Ricklis and Cox 1993).
Regardless of the utility of lithic analyses for
defining patterns of biotic resource procurement,
the environmental zones defined by Tomka and
Bousman may eventually provide the most useful
basis for elucidating prehistoric subsistence and
settlement patterns. Definition of these basic patterns in the Rio Grande delta area will depend upon
data on subsistence and seasonality from a number
of sites within each resource zone.
Recent findings at the Horse Island site
(41 CF29) on the Laguna Madre mainland shoreline
(Eling et al. 1993) suggest that analyses of marine
fish otoliths can provide crucial information on the
seasonality of fishing on the lower coast. Eling
examined 100 black drum otoliths from test excavations at the site, and found that most fish died
during the late fall through spring. Relatively little
fishing seems to have taken place during the summer-early fall part of the annual cycle. More data
from other sites in the area will be required to
determine if this was a recurrent seasonal pattern
along the lower coast. It is interesting that Early
Historic Spanish documents suggest that native
peoples in northern Tamaulipas engaged in fishing
mainly during the winter, when inland plant resources were of low seasonal productivity (Salinas
1990:117). Additional archeological seasonality
studies may show that coastal fishing was an important winter subsistence focus, as it apparently
was to the north along the central Texas coast.
Another point which emerges from
ethnohistorical research is that the Rio Grande delta
was a rich biotic zone that supported a relatively
high human population density. Even as late as the
middle of the eighteenth century, after native populations had generally been reduced b,y Old World
epidemic diseases, the area may have been home to
as many as !5,000 people (Salinas 1990:138). It
remains to be determined whether indigenous populations were as highly mobile as assumed by Tomka
(1990), or whether the rich resource zones of the
delta proper and the Rio Grande and its floodplain
woodlands, along with the productive fisheries of

293

lower Laguna Madre, sustained relatively large
groups for significantly long segments of the annual
cycle. Conceivably, populations may have aggregated seasonally during the cooler months in these
zones, and then dispersed into smaller bands to
gather plant foods and hunt during the summer, as
suggested by the very limited ethnohistorical data.
Sites in Cameron County tend to exhibit higher
densities of cultural debris than sites situated further
from the Rio Grande delta (M. B. Collins, 1990
personal communication). It may be that most professionally investigated sites show low densities of
material, and thus suggest relatively short-term occupations by highly mobile groups, only because
they are located in marginal areas which have fortuitously been investigated within the framework of
cultural resource management projects (e.g., the various sites reported in inland Willacy and Hidalgo
Counties along artificial drainage ditches [see Day
et al. 1981; Collins et al. !989; Bousman et al.
1990]). Indeed, Hester (1969b:163) has suggested
that sizeable cemeteries in the southern part of the
region, in proximity to the Rio Grande, may represent coastal-riverine occupations by groups that practiced only limited mobility and buried their dead
repeatedly at favored locations. Systematic investigations of sites in more highly productive resource
zones on the lower Texas coast may then give a
significantly different picture of aboriginal adaptive
patterns than is presently available from the archeological record of the region.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
Much of the more recent work discussed here
for the central coast, directed by the author, would
have been impossible without the enthusiastic assistance of many people. I would especially like to
thank those individuals who assisted for extended
periods in various field projects: Jerry Bauman,
Nancy and Larry Beaman, Jim and Marion Craft,
Kim and Susan Cox, Alexander N. Cox, John
French, Rita Gunter, Luke Huston, John and Arlene
McGee, Ray Myers, and Gregg Willman. The radiocarbon dates reported by the author were variously made possible by funding from the Donors
Fund of the Texas Archeological Society, the James
R. Dougherty Foundation, The Scientific Research
Society of Sigma Xi, and Koch Industries. Access
to important sites along the Aransas River was made
