ABSTRACT
In November 2006, archeologists from Blanton & Associates, Inc., at the request of Chica and Associates,
on behalf of the project sponsor the Texas Department of Transportation’s (TxDOT) Abilene District,
conducted an intensive archeological survey on US 180 at the North Prong of Hubbard Creek in
Shackleford County, Texas prior to the construction of new bridges to replace the existing northbound
(CSJ: 0011-05-043) and southbound (CSJ: 0011-05-044) bridges. Augmented by backhoe trenching, the
survey found no cultural resources. No artifacts were collected during field investigations so there was no
curation.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
PROJECT TITLE: Archeological Survey for a Proposed Bridge Replacements on US 180 at the North
Prong of Hubbard Creek in the City of Albany, Shackleford County, Texas.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The project involved an archeological records review and an intensive
archeological survey on US 180 at North Prong of Hubbard Creek in the City of Albany, Shackleford
County, Texas prior to proposed construction by the Texas Department of Transportation’s (TxDOT)
Abilene District that would replace the existing northbound (CSJ: 0011-05-043) and southbound (CSJ:
0011-05-044) bridges. All construction would occur within existing right-of-way (ROW), which varies
between approximately 100 and 200 feet wide. The overall area of potential effect (APE) for archeology
is approximately 393 feet east of the bridge and 397 feet west of the bridge for a total corridor of 970
linear feet that varies from 200 to 100 feet in width. Because the creek crossing contains recent alluvium
with the potential to contain intact buried cultural deposits, archeological investigations involved shovel
testing and backhoe trenching.
PROJECT LOCATION: The project area is located in central Shackleford County. The study area is
mapped on the Albany, Texas USGS 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle.
DATES OF WORK: November 28 and 29, 2006.
PURPOSE OF WORK: Blanton & Associates, Inc., is assisting the project sponsor in their compliance
with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (and subsequent amendments) and the
Antiquities Code of Texas.
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Brandon S. Young
TEXAS ANTIQUITIES PERMIT NUMBER: 4325
NEWLY RECORDED SITES: None.
PREVIOUSLY RECORDED SITES: None.
COMMENTS: Based on the lack of archeological deposits discovered within the project area, Blanton &
Associates, Inc., recommends that the proposed construction be allowed to proceed as planned within the
existing ROW without additional investigations. Given the level of surface and subsurface disturbances
the ROW has experienced, there is little to no potential for buried intact archeological deposits within the
APE. However, if the planned construction should require additional work space outside of the existing
ROW, then further cultural resource investigations in those areas would be necessary.
Investigations adhered to Texas Historical Commission (THC) survey standards (n.d.), the guidelines of
the Council of Texas Archeologists (1987), and the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines
(National Park Service 1983). Moreover, the survey was designed and executed in accordance with the
First Amended Programmatic Agreement among the Federal Highway Administration, the THC, the
Advisory Council for Historic Preservation, and TxDOT, as well as the Memorandum of Understanding
between TxDOT and the THC.

INTRODUCTION
On November 28 and 29, 2006, Blanton & Associates, Inc., at the request of Kimley-Horn and
Associates, Inc., on behalf of the Texas Department of Transportation’s (TxDOT) Abilene District,
conducted an intensive archeological survey (as defined in §26.20(1) and 26.20(2) of the Antiquities Code
of Texas (now subsumed in Title 13, Part II of the Texas Administrative Code [TAC]), for proposed onsystem bridge replacement on US 180 over the North Prong of Hubbard Creek in the city of Albany,
Shackelford County, Texas (Figures 1.1 and 1.2). All construction would occur within existing US 180
right-of-way (ROW), which varies between approximately 100 and 200 feet wide.
There is currently one eastbound bridge and one westbound bridge on US 180 at the North Prong of
Hubbard Creek. The existing northbound bridge (CSJ: 0011-05-043) was built in 1926 and widened in
1939 at the same time (1939) the southbound structure (CSJ: 0011-05-044) was constructed, with
modifications to both structures occurring since then. The northbound bridge has four spans covering a
length of 155 feet, an overall width of 35 feet, and a clear roadway width of 26 feet with five-foot wide
sidewalks. The southbound bridge is similar to the eastbound, but with five spans (Figure 2). The
proposed bridges would be 72 feet wide with four 11-foot wide lanes, two in each direction. These lanes
would be divided by an eight-foot wide striped median with a two-foot wide shoulder. Sidewalks, each
seven feet wide, would be present on both sides of the bridge. Overall length of the bridges would be
180 feet and consist of three 60-foot long spans of prestressed concrete beams supported by eight 30-inch
drilled shafts at each end of the bridge and two sets of four 36-inch columns within the creek crossing. No
reconstruction of the roadway is proposed, only a small amount of repaving, therefore the estimated
maximum depth of subsurface impacts would be the bridge columns at 19 feet below the existing ground
surface.
The existing approach roadways consist of four 11-foot wide lanes with two-foot wide shoulders divided
by a four-foot raised median (Figure 3). The same configuration would be retained by the proposed
project; however, two feet of curb and gutter as well as a six-foot wide sidewalk would be added on each
side of the roadway for a distance of 50 feet from the proposed bridge on the northbound side of the
bridge and 63.5 feet on the southbound. This sidewalk would extend on either side and under the bridge.
No detours or temporary or permanent easements would be necessary for the project according to plans.
The overall area of potential effect (APE) for archeology is approximately 393 feet east of the bridge and
397 feet west of the bridge for a total corridor of 970 linear feet that varies from 200 to 100 feet in width.
As the project would occur on property owned by the State of Texas, it is subject to the provisions of the
Antiquities Code of Texas, now subsumed in Title 13, Part II of the Texas Administrative Code. This
legislation defines the necessary conditions for recognition and preservation of State Archeological
Landmarks (SALs) and requires that any state agency must identify potential SALs through survey of
public lands prior to actions that could potentially damage those SALs. The Texas Historical Commission
(THC) Division of Archeology administers the code’s provisions. Archeological survey must be
conducted under a Texas Antiquities Permit issued by the THC in accordance with the provisions of the
code. The current project was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 4325 issued to Principal
Investigator Brandon S. Young.

Because funding for the project will come in part from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the
proposed construction project is also subject to the provisions of Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA). The intent of the NHPA is to protect significant cultural resources that
might be threatened by actions that are federally funded or permitted, or which occur on federal property.
The act, which created the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and the Advisory Council for
Historic Preservation (ACHP), states that the ACHP must be afforded the chance to comment when any
cultural resources eligible for inclusion on the NRHP are present in an area affected by federal agency
actions or actions funded or permitted by federal agencies. The federal regulatory process is described in
detail in the ACHP regulations (36 CFR 800) and in the regulations of the agencies and federal divisions
engaged in historic preservation.
Protection of cultural resources under federal law is tied to eligibility for the NRHP that depends on site
significance as defined by National Park Service (NPS) rules 36 CFR 60. Although the ACHP is the final
arbiter of the Section 106 process, which includes the identification, evaluation, and treatment of
significant properties and impacts, in practice, the process is typically limited to review and concurrence
by the involved agency and the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), represented in Texas by the
THC. The required Section 106 and Antiquities Code of Texas coordination shall be facilitated under the
First Amended Programmatic Agreement among the FHWA, the ACHP, the THC, and TxDOT, as well
as the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the THC and TxDOT.

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The project area is located in the Rolling Plains ecological region of Texas, which is characterized by a
gently undulating to rolling plain. Elevations across the Rolling Plains rang from approximately 1,000
feet in the eastern margins of the region to 2,200 feet at the base of the Cap Rock Escarpment on the
region’s western edges (Jordan et al. 1984).
The bridge locations are underlain by Quaternary alluvium, which consists of floodplain and low terrace
deposits consisting of sand, clay, and silt (Barnes 1972). Quaternary alluvium found along local and
regional drainages has been consistently shown to contain buried cultural deposits. Soils of the project
area are Frio silty clay, occasionally flooded, on both banks of the stream and Nukrum clay, 1 to 3 percent
slopes, in the more upland area east of the bridge. The parent material of Frio silty clay was loamy
alluvium. This soil extends to a depth of 80 inches. Nukrum clay extends to depths of 60 inches and was
formed from mixed clayey alluvium (National Resources Conservation Service 2006).
Shackelford County lies in the Kansan biotic province (Blair 1950). Vegetation is a mixed-grass plain
dominated by little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii) and
western wheatgrass (Agropyrons smithii). A mesquite-grass association is common and dominated by
mesquite (Prosopis grandulosa), with various species of grama (Bouteloua spp.), three-awn (Aristida
spp.) and broomweed (Gutierrezia texana). Shorter grass species include buffalograss (Buchloe
dactyloides) and various grama grasses.
The floodplain of the North Prong of Hubbard Creek on both sides of the existing bridges is used as
parkland by the City of Albany, while residential and commercial properties are located in the
surrounding uplands. The creek has been dammed below the bridge creating a pool under and around the
bridges.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Archeologists from Blanton & Associates, Inc., performed a background review prior to field
investigations to determine the locations of any previous investigations and/or previously recorded sites
within a 1,000-meter radius of the project area. The background review involved an examination of
records at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) and the THC’s online Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas. That review indicated that no previously recorded sites or previous project
areas were located at or near the bridges. However, there are two historic markers present in a park
upstream of the bridge and west of the creek. A 1936 Centennial Marker commemorating Shackelford
County and a more recent marker commemorating the Cook Ranch Oil Field are present. Just north of the
northern limits of the study area is the Shackelford County Courthouse Historic District, a NRHP District
containing 34 buildings, including the courthouse and town square.

METHODS
The intensive archeological survey on US 180 involved surface and subsurface investigations of sufficient
intensity to determine the nature, extent, and if possible, the significance of any discovered cultural
resources. All trenching activities were monitored by archeologists to avoid any unnecessary damage to
potentially buried cultural deposits. Excavated backhoe trenches were approximately 5.0 meters
(16.4 feet) long, 1.0 meter (3.3 feet) wide, and 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) deep. Following excavations,
archeologists immediately cleaned and examined trench walls to locate any in situ artifacts, cultural
features, and/or soil anomalies in the trench profiles. Stratigraphic units identified in each trench were
then described in detail on a Blanton & Associates geologic profile form. Additional documentation
included detailed descriptions of the proposed construction areas, and provenience data obtained with a
hand-held GPS receiver for backhoe trench and shovel test locations. Field work was thoroughly
photographed.
Investigations adhered to THC survey standards (n.d.), as well as the guidelines of the Council of Texas
Archeologists (1987), and the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983).
Moreover, the survey was designed and executed in accordance with the PA among the FHWA, the THC,
the ACHP, and TxDOT, as well as the MOU between TxDOT and the THC.

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS
The US 180 APE has experienced both surface and subsurface disturbances from buried utilities (i.e. fiber
optic cables, waterlines, and sewer), as well as bridge and roadway construction. The project area is on
the south side of Albany and surrounded by municipal parkland in all quadrants of the creek crossing, as
well as commercial and residential use elsewhere (Figure 4). On the east side of the highway between the
north end of the bridge and the northern end of the APE near South 4th Street are seven residential and
commercial lots with houses and businesses (Figure 5).
Surface investigations found no prehistoric or historic cultural materials, only modern trash and debris.
The surface examination did, however, clearly indicate that most of the APE sits atop a substantial fill
section that occupies the majority of the ROW, thereby leaving a relatively narrow strip between the edge
of the fill and the ROW boundary fences. This is particularly noticeable on the south side of the creek
(Figure 6). Moreover, the northeast and southeast quadrants of the study area have a number of buried
utilities that restricted backhoe trenching (Figure 7). The fiber optic cables parallel US 180, while the
water and sewer lines flow perpendicular (east-west) to the highway and APE. Because of these
conditions, backhoe trenching was spatially restricted and by necessity, limited.
A total of three backhoe trenches (BHT) were excavated within the APE. BHTs 1 and 2 were located in
the southwest quadrant of the project area and BHT 3 was located on the opposite bank of the creek in the
northwest quadrant (see Figure 4). BHT 1 was excavated to a maximum depth of 180 centimeters below
ground surface and contained nothing but compacted light brown clay fill with up to fist size water-worn
gravels and rock fragments (Figure 8).
BHT 2 was located west and down slope from BHT 1 and contained three discrete strata from 0 to 140
centimeters below ground surface. Zone I (0 to 33 centimeters) consisted of the same clay and rock fill
(with plastic and metal debris) observed in BHT 1. Zone II (33 to 65 centimeters) was moist and friable
brown (10YR 3/3) silty clay with a subangular blocky structure and an abrupt smooth boundary.
Inclusions included few rootlets and pea gravels that likely percolated down from Zone I. In profile, Zone
II was obviously truncated during road construction (Figure 9) very light brown (10YR 6/8) sandy clay
matrix with approximately 98% gravels ranging in size from pea size to fist size. At depth, further
excavation with the backhoe was virtually impossible due to the dense gravel deposit so excavations were
halted.
BHT 3 was located in the northwest quadrant of the project area roughly five meters west of the edge of
the highway pavement and excavated to a maximum depth of 153 centimeters below ground surface
(Figure 10). A total of four zones were identified in BHT 3. Zone I (0 to 96 centimeters) was clay and
gravel construction fill containing modern nails, barbed wire, and glass fragments. The majority (ca. 95%)
of the matrix consisted of fist size gravels and was very compacted. The lower boundary was abrupt and
smooth.
Zone II (96 to 101 centimeters) was yellowish brown (7.5YR 4/4) dry and slightly hard silt clay loam
with a weak blocky structure and golf ball size gravel inclusions. The lower boundary was gradual and
smooth. Similar to Zone II in BHT 2, this zone represents the natural soil that was truncated during
highway construction. Zone III (101 to 144 centimeters) was dry and hard light brown (10YR 7/6) silty
clay matrix with a weak blocky structure that consisted of approximately 50% gravels. The lower
boundary was clear and smooth. The lower boundary was clear and smooth.

Note the abrupt and smooth boundary between Zones I and II

Zone III is very similar to Zone II, except for a slightly lighter color and an increase in clay content. Zone
IV (144 to 153 centimeters) was yellowish-brown (10YR 7/6) moist and very firm clay matrix that was
99% gravel. This stratum was extremely compacted and appeared to represent poorly consolidated
bedrock. At depth, the backhoe had difficulty excavating through the gravels and the trench was halted.
Because of the construction fill and truncated soils in the APE, numerous adjacent parking lots and
driveways, the density of buried utilities that have disturbed the APE, as well as the front yards of the
residential lots north of the creek that contain municipal utilities (i.e., water and natural gas), shovel
testing throughout the remainder of the project area was deemed unnecessary.
Based on these results, no cultural resources would be impacted within the US 180 at the North Prong of
Hubbard Creek APE by the proposed bridge replacement and roadway improvement construction due to
pervasive disturbances from buried utilities, a substantial fill section associated with the roadway, thin
truncated natural strata, and thick strata of gravels below the truncated soils.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Intensive survey efforts found no cultural resources within the existing US 180 ROW at the North Prong
of Hubbard Creek. Surface and subsurface utilities, residential development, and previous highway
construction has removed or significantly disturbed the soils within the APE. Due to these conditions,
shovel testing was deemed unnecessary. Because of two very large fiber optic cables in the northeast and
southeast quadrants of the study area that could not be located by the utility representative once the cable
conduits leave the bridge and go underground, backhoe trenching was not conducted there to avoid
damaging the massive cables.
Based on these data, Blanton & Associates recommends that, as no prehistoric or historic cultural
resources will be impacted within the APE by the planned construction on US 180, the proposed roadway
improvements should be allowed to proceed as planned without further cultural resource investigations. If
it is determined that the planned construction requires impacts to occur outside the existing ROW, then
additional cultural resource investigations in those areas will be necessary.
In the event that previously unidentified archeological materials are discovered during construction, all
construction in the immediate area will cease and TxDOT archeologists will be contacted to initiate
accidental discovery procedures in accordance with the terms of the First Amended Programmatic
Agreement among the THC, the FHWA, and TxDOT, as well as the aforementioned MOU between
TxDOT and the THC.
