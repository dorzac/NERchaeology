INTRODUCTION
Sporadic archeological activity by the Texas Archeological Survey in
the San Gabriel River drainage in Williamson County, Texas, spans an 11year period.

Initiation of work in 1963 by TAS (then the Texas Archeolog-

ical Salvage Project), The University of Texas at Austin, was the result
of support by the National Park Service through the vehicle of the Interagency Archeological Salvage Program to mitigate expected loss of archeological and historical resources due to creation of three reservoirs along
a relatively short segment of a single drainage--the San Gabriel River
(Fig. 1).

Duration and intensity of the archeological work has varied;

most, however, has been confined to survey and testing.
North Fork Reservoir
First efforts toward systematic archeological investigation in the
North Fork area were by Mark L. Parsons in 1963.

Immediately subsequent

to this brief effort, Harry J. Shafer and James E. Corbin conducted archeological recconaissance in the three reservoir areas (North Fork, South Fork
and Laneport) and reported their results (including Parson's data) in 1965.
Included in this report is the identification of 109 prehistoric sites, 55
of which were located in the North Fork Reservoir area.

Forty-four of these

sites were within the proposed reservoir limits; the additional 11 sites
were located in Dobb's Hollow, a tributary on the north side of the North
Fork of the San Gabriel and immediately east of the main dam axis (Figs. 1
and 2).
In accordance with the recormnendations of the initial report, test
excavations were undertaken at avo sites in 1967.

These were the John Ischy

Site (41 WM 49), a burned rock midden, and the Barker Site (41 WM 71), a
surface site associated with an alluvial terrace (Sorrow 1970).

The following year (1968) a program was designed to test archeological
sites with a potential for substantial scientific return.
were attacked:

Specific problems

these included an attempt at definition of sites which

seemed to represent temporally restricted occupations or those which appeared
to be activity-specific sites.
Four of these sites (WM 56, 73, 88 and 115) are burned rock middens;
the others (WM 33, 34, 56, and 87) are sites buried in terrace deposits
of the San Gabriel River (Sorrow 1973).
Laneport Reservoir
Subsequent to the survey, a second phase of archeological investigations was initiated in the Laneport Reservoir area in 1968.

Three prehistoric

sites which fell within the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods (that is,
within the regional chronological time frame defined as between 7000 B.C.
and A.D. 1700) were tested.

The sites were 41 WM 118, WM 133 and WM 135.

The goal of these limited excavations was the development of quantitative
data regarding the cultural ecology with the ultimate goal of definition
and explanation of the generations of culture persistence and change in the
Laneport area (Eddy 1973: iii).
A fourth site, Loeve-Fox (41 WM 230), has been the subject of excavation
for a period of time by the Texas Archeological Survey and the Department
of Anthropology, The University of Texas at Austin.
a cemetery, has been exposed.

Part of one component,

Future work is anticipated at the site.

Preliminary analysis of the initial season is underway as part of a continuing
contract between the National Park Service and the Texas Archeological Survey.
The 1970, 1974 Seasons in North Fork
Following the three previously described field seasons, a fourth including
survey and testing, was begun in April 1970 and extended through a 3-month
period.

During this time, additional examination of the archeological re-

sources in the North Fork Reservoir and peripheral areas was made under the
field supervision of William M. Sorrow.

Sorrow was assisted by Daymond D.

National Park Service.

An additional 42 sites were identified during this

period and limited tests conducted at four of them.

Further recording at

one of the tested sites (WM 197) was conducted by Vance Holliday and Douglas
B. Comstock of TAS in June 1971.
Finally, five days in March 1974, were spent by the author and Grant D.
Hall, Vance T. Holliday and Michael Thomas in re-examining some of the previously defined sites and searching out others in areas which had been
inaccessible in the past.
were recorded.

During this brief

p~riod

five additional sites

One, Site 41 WM 263, was tested.

It is with data collected during these periods that the present report
is specifically concerned.

However, in the concluding discussion of the

archeological potential of the area, the material collected during previous
seasons will be considered (Shafer and Corbin 1965; Sorrow 1969, 1970, 1973).
Physiographic Setting
The North Fork Reservoir area lies only slightly west of the point where
the north-south running Balcones Escarpment divides the Comanche Dissected
Plateau from the predominantly flat Coastal Plain.

At places along the stream

valley, canyons (particularly the tributary canyons of the mainstem) can be
deep; however, this relief increases as the escarpment moves south.

The

average elevation at Austin is 300 feet, whereas at Del Rio it reaches 1800
feet (Fenneman 1938: 55).

Valley cutting in this area of the San Gabriel

is not so pronounced and the flood plain of the mainstem is broad at the
upper end of the proposed reservoir basin.

A series of hollows or springs

feed into the mainstem all along its course (Fig. 2) and it is within these
tributaries that the greatest relief is encountered.
Outcrops of Georgetown and Buda formations (Cretaceous) are numerous
along the upper terrace of the river and provided an abundance of raw material for manufacture of stone tools by the aboriginals.

These well exploited

areas are easily detected as one walks the landscape.
Regional Archeological Context
Based on the information generated from the archeological work in the
three Williamson County reservoirs as well as that in nearby reservoir basins

6

(primarily Stillhouse Hollow, Belton and Canyon reservoirs), it can be
generally stated that the predominant aboriginal remains in the area belong
to those archeological periods regionally described as Archaic (7000 B.C. A.D. 500) and Post-Archaic (A.D. 500 - A.D. 1700).

Some isolated remains

of Paleo-Indian (? - 7000 B.C.) have been located, but the evidence of this
earlier occupation is mainly limited to fortuitous surface finds.

The exca-

vation of one major site, Levi Rockshelter (Alexander 1958), demonstrated
the existence of such an early occupation in the region in a primary stratigraphic context.
The Archaic remains are the most abundantly represented; they result
from a culture whose subsistence relied on diversified hunting and gathering
techniques.

Material evidence of these peoples contain for the most part

stone implements, including bifacially and unifacially worked tools and,
chopping and grinding implements.

Occasional bone tools are recovered but

the generally poor conditions for preservation characteristic of the region
largely limits the range of materials present in residues of Archaic age.
The advent of the bow and arrow (the accepted time marker for the beginning of the Post Archaic along with limited amounts of pottery) is well
recognized in the area.

With the exception of this technological introduc-

tion, the tool kit has many similarities in kind to the "typical" Archaic
assemblage.
Local chronological periods have been hypothesized from the occurence
of distinctive projectile point styles recovered from stratified contexts
and dated in varying degrees of confidence by radiocarbon date series.

Data

illustrated in Table 1 are the result of a synthesis of the data from Sorrow
and others (1967), Johnson and others (1962) and Eddy (1973).

THE SURVEY
Archeological Site Inventory
The archeological resources defined here are briefly described in terms
of type of site, location relative to major and minor drainages and surface
manifestations.

No recommendations are made specifically by site; comments

on the reservoir as a whole will be made in a concluding statement.
Many of the sites included in the present inventory are located out
of the reservoir, or, more specifically, out of the maximum floodpool elevation (here 858.7 feet elev.).
a survey.

Generally, this sets the arbitrary limit for

It is evident that while a specific elevation may represent the

immediate reservoir impact, peripheral areas which are frequently developed
as recreational areas (camping, marinas) or privately developed for housing
increase the possibility of vulnerability and hence destruction to an even
greater degree.

Unfortunately, a large segment of the archeological past is

lost unrecorded, and the true prehistoric/historic situation in a reservoir
area obscured by this lack of information.
Study of the investigated sites (from extant files and field observation) resulted in the definition of six types.

These types as defined here

for the North Fork drainage and its adjacent uplands and sites on the Middle
Fork include:
Burned rock midden:

(BRM)

This site type is represented by an accumu-

lation of thermally-fractured rock, generally manifest in site shape as round
or oval rises above the surface(s) extant during occupation.

The matrix is

composed of angular, fire-cracked rock and, commonly, lesser amounts of flint
debris, bone, snail and mussel shell and dark, organically enriched sediments.
Rockshelter:

(RS)

In the North Fork area these sites are generally

small, shallow overhangs occuring in the limestone bluffs which bound the
river and its tributaries.

Frequently they have seep springs in them and

8

are damp.

This kind of site is rare in the North Fork Reservoir limits

as there are only a few areas where the river is sufficiently entrenched
for shelters to have been formed.
Open Scatter:

(OS)

Common among the sites recorded are large or small

open areas of highly variable content with exposed flint debris and some
finished tools.

Frequently, these open sites are in close proximity to the

burned rock middens.

The sites vary from areas lightly covered with debris

to large extended areas covering as much as 200· yards by 7 5 yards.

At times

these sites are recognized as contiguous areas of alternating concentrations
and thin scatter.

Horizontal extent varies; vertical extent is frequently

confined to the upper 5 cm. or so of soil.
Buried terrace:

(T)

Aboriginal camps associated with river terraces

and covered by alluvium are commonly found in the North Fork area.

Size

and depth vary greatly; generally the sites contain a variety of artifacts,
thus suggesting that they are of a larger more permanent or more extensive
nature than hypothetical single-activity sites (that is, chipping or processing stations).
Historic:

(H)

Sites with components consisting of European objects

(such as ceramics or metal) or which consist of structural remains post-dating
A.D. 1750 (European entrance into the area) are grouped here.
Sinkhole:

(SH)

"a funnel-shaped depression in the land surface gen-

erally in a limestone region ••• water commonly drains downward and is lost
but the passage is sometimes blocked so that a pond is formed" (Glossary of
Geology, Supplement p. 60).
Such a breakdown of site types was recognized for central Texas generally.
Suhm (1960: 68-89) discussed this in her archeological synthesis of the area.
These types are applied to various site manifestations in the North Fork
Reservoir with the understanding that the following biases do occur, may be
reflected, and must be considered in the final evaluation:
For years there has been much activity in the North Fork area generated
toward relic collecting.

Schuetz (1957: 135-168) reported on a collection

amassed over a two-year period from the North Fork region.

The collection

includes over several thousand examples of projectile points. and there were the fragmentary or "imperfect" examples.

.The individual who dug in the sites kept

10

all perfect, i.e. complete, examples.

There is no doubt that if most of

the recognizable, time-diagnostic projectile points, other finished stone
tools (chipped or ground) are removed from a site, then the description of
something as an "open scatter" might result.

The open upland sites in the

North Fork area are more vulnerable to this kind of collecting.
Individuals reflect a bias themselves.

Objectivity may always be a

goal, but, unless a controlled, systematic collection is made at a site,
then the resultant collection does indeed reflect the bias of the collector,
rather than an adequate sampling of the site.
Therefore, in general, samples taken from any reservoir area reflect
an intrinsic bias--regional topographic situation (for example, deflation)
or man-made changes (such as land modification or relic collecting).
Sites shown in Figure 2 are all registered at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL), The University of Texas at Austin.

According

to that system, each site has been given a unique trinomial designation.
For example, 41 WM 172, indicates that the site is in Texas (41), in Williamson County (WM) and is the one-hundredth and seventy-second site listed (172).
Survey forms, U.S.G.S. 7.5' quads marked with site locations, photographs,
and collections generated from this survey will all be permanently housed
with TARL.
Figure 2 indicates the general locality of the sites within the North
Fork Reservoir and contiguous areas (such as the uplands and the nearby
Middle Fork of the San Gabriel to the south).

Sites recorded and reported

previous to this work (Shafer and Corbin 1965) are also included on the map;
the overall relationships of the sites in the reservoir area will be discussed
in the concluding statement.
In the listing to follow certain abbreviations for the site types are
used for convenience.

They are:

OS for open scatter; R for rockshelter;

T for buried terrace; BRM for burned rock midden; S for sinkhole and H for
historic.

Sites listed on this inventory and marked "tested" are described

in greater detail in a later section of the report.

Artifacts
Artifacts reported here were collected exclusively from the surface.
The entire collection is made up of lithic items.

Although samples of flint

flakes were collected, no attempt was made to examine them for evidence
of utilization.

The artifacts have been broken into the following

cate-

gories:
Arrow Points
Dart Points
Large Stenuned Point
Drills
Gouges
Bifaces
Crude Bifaces
Chopping Tools
Cores
Scrapers
Hands tones
Grinding Slabs
Time diagnostic projectiles (arrows and darts) in the collection serve
to indicate, in the broad sense, at least portions of the temporal extent of
occupation represented by a given site.

Projectile point types are based

on the typology described in Suhm and Jelks (1962) unless otherwise noted.
Characteristics as stated in the description of pre-established types are
those which the specimen(s) under discussion exhibit and, thus, constitute
their basis for categorization.

Measurements of individual specimens are

given within the descriptions and are in centimeters.

Abbreviations used

here include:

L, length; W, width; SL, stem length; SW, stem width at base;

T, thickness.

Gouges (2 specimens)
Characteristics: bifacial or unifacial tools with prominent, carefully
prepared bits.
Corrnnents: Gouges are recurrent tool types in Central Texas site inventories. However, as a category they have not been carefully studied for
technological nor contextural manifestations. As a result, little more than
the recognition of it as a tool type can be made. The two examples recovered
during the survey are quite different. One (Fig. 5 B) is a carefully-shaped
triangular unifacial implement; whereas the second specimen (Fig. (5 C) is
a sub-rectangular, more crudely made bifacial tools with a prominent, though
not so well made, bit end as the former specimen.

Bifaces (118 specimens; 21 complete, Fig. 5 D-P, 45 proximal, 20 medial,
33 distal)
Characteristics: stemless, generally larger, less well made than dart
points, variety of shapes.
Comments: Although frequently these items are subdivided and grouped
under the functional category "knives" or broken up into more finite groups
either by manufacturing technique (Sorrow 1973: 83-95) or morphology, here
they are considered as a homogeneous unit representing a broad tool category.
In shapes, the collection ranges from lanceolate, to triangular, to ovate,
to bipointed (Fig. 5 D-POJ. Table- 3 lists numbers of specimens by site in
medial, proximal and distal or complete specimens from the collection.

Crude Bif aces (26 specimens)
Characteristics: large, thick, crudely chipped bifacial tools.
Comments: The tool class grouped here differs from the more refined
"Bifaces" in that their overall dimensions are larger and workmanship is
cruder; frequently, part of the nodular cortextremains on the specimen.
Two visually distinct groups and a third catch-all category are defined
here:
Type 1 (Fig. 6A, B)
A basically sub-rectangular tool with cortex occasionally present on
one or both of the faces (Fig. 6A). The distal end is rounded; proximal
ends are not regular in shape.
Type 2 (Fig. 6 D, D)
The second distinct type represented within the collection is composed
of round to oval tools with cortex at the base or proximal end. The proximal
end has an incipient stem.
Miscellaneous (10 specimens)
The remaining items grouped with the crude bifaces are categorized
as Miscellaneous. They exhibit a diversity in shape, range of thickness and
size but no additional specialized characteristics which would warrant
individual description.

specimens)

Characteristics: unifacial, one or more edges suitable for scraping.
Comments: With one exception, a large concave scraper, Type 7, all
scrapers are made on flakes. The aberrant specimen, Fig. 8 M, is made on a
core. The collection of flake scraping tools was broken into more finite
groups based on the following criteria: Orientation of the scraping edge
is discussed relative to its position to the bulb of percussion (Fig. 7).
Such a procedure was followed in order to present a uniform base of comparison. This breakdown follows that of Prewitt (ms. in preparation) for similar
items from Laneport Reservoir.

Discussion of Results
The present survey resulted in the recognition of 47 additional sites
in the North Fork Reservoir area and peripheral drainages.

For the most

part, it was confined to the uplands and to the adjacent Middle Fork drainage
(Fig. 2).

The following list illustrates the breakdown by site type as re-

corded in this season.

Table 4 correlates the Shafer-Corbin sites (1965)

to the present nomenclature.

Four sites showed several components on surficial

examination, that is, historic component, burne·d rock midden and/or open
scatter in combination and this is reflected in the percentages where each
component is individually counted.

These categories are thus not mutually

exclusive.

The strong bias toward the open scatter site is a direct reflection of
the survey itself, i.e. conspicuously confined to the uplands.

Previously,

the occurrence of these sites has been noted as a predmminantly upland manifestation (Shum 1960:70).

The information was computed from site descriptions in Shafer and Corbin,
An Appraisal of the Archeological Resources of North Fork, South Fork, and
Laneport Reservoirs, Williamson County,

T~xas,

1965.

The distribution of the open scatter sites can probably be correlated
with the geology of the area.

That is, with the rising Balcones Fault with

the exposed Georgetown and Buda formations throughout.

These exposed outcrops

provided a readily available source of raw material for the manufacture of
stone implements.

As

such, they were efficiently exploited by the aboriginal

occupants of the area, presumably over a long period of time.

The incidence

of these open scatter sites seems predictable since their association with
the geologic situation is manifested by cores, an abundance of flaking residue
and, rarely, finished tools.
The location of only six burned rock middens during this survey again
reflects the emphasis placed on the upland terrain.

The burned rock middens

recorded during the 1965 survey were located at the bases of hills and on
terraces adjacent to the river. The sites are either overlooking the river
in the mainstem valley (WM 189, WM 215) or are confined within smaller tributary valleys (WM 208, WM 218, WM 260, WM 261).

Frequently a relationship

between burned rock middens and contiguous open scatter is implied.

This

implication is one of proximity and observed frequency of association.

A

contemporl.neity of the occupations has not yet been demonstrated; however,
the presumption of diverse yet complementary activities suggests a basis for
systemic interrelationship.

Those sites reexamined or located in 1974 (WM

261, WM 263, WM 218, WM 208) seem to bear out this implied connection.
Assessment of the terrace sites is more difficult since their recorded
presence is of ten merely the result of a fortuitous location of occupational
debris eroding from a bank.

In some cases (WM 214, for example) the aboriginal

42
deposits have been covered by several feet of alluvial sediments.

Predicting

the locus and occurrence of this type of site, then, is difficult at best.
Rockshelters are, of course, naturally determined and bear no obvious
relationship to cultural patterning; however, these overhangs were frequently
inhabited during prehistoric times.

In the North Fork area their numbers

are few and locations predictable as there are only a few places deeply enough
entrenched for shelters to have formed,

Frequently, the rockshelters (which

have little depth or height) contain seep springs which (WM 197, WM 182)
cause them to be constantly wet; it is not known whether this had any bearing
on the prehistoric situation.
Historic settlement in the North San Gabriel Reservoir area has been
neglected or gone unrecognized as a part of the survey of the area.

During

the present survey only one historic component was recognized (WM 200); two
additional sites were recorded during the 1974 reexamination (WM 219, WM 261).
One of these sites can be attributed to the later decades of the 19th century
and perhaps the beginning of the 20th century.
The present collection of artifacts reflects aboriginal occupation
spanning the Archaic (postulated for the North Fork and adjacent areas as the
period of time ranging from 7000 B.C. to A.D. 600).
One early Archaic dart point, Martindale, was recovered from Site WM 262.
Other time diagnostic forms include Pedernales (Sites WM 185, WM 261, WM 262)
indicative of a Middle Archaic occupation in the area, and Fairland and Ensor
points, both of which are Late Archaic or transitional forms (Table 1). The
only Late Prehistoric projectile points, two Scallorn eddy arrow points, came
from the same site (WM 206).

No sites containing ceramics were located.

The above assertation of time diagnostic point types and chronology
reflects data compiled from excavations in nearby reservoirs as well as North
Fork Reservoir (Sorrow and others 1967; Sorrow 1969, 1970, 1973; Eddy 1973;
Johnson and others 1962).

While such chronological indicators have been
14
placed within this framework by controls such as
c dating, their part in

determining age and temporal span of survey sites is to be regarded as a broad
indicator of the potential of the area.
Information generated from this survey closely parallels that indicated
from an earlier examination in the area (Shafer and Corbin 1965).

The sites

43

within this drainage, as now known reflect a predominantly Archaic aboriginal
occupation with sparse Late Prehistoric manifestations.

This predominance

could be the result of sampling errors and such a possibility is not to be
ignored.

Recommendations directed toward an attempt at recording this variable

are presented in the research design.
Within a more specialized framework, artifacts represented in the collection reflect a hunting/gathering (or food collecting) subsistence and
point to a variety of specific activities related to this; for example, hide
preparation (possibly scrapers); food processing (hand stones, grinding slabs,
large bifaces).

A more controlled contextual examination coupled with specific

intra- and inter-site comparison would no doubt result in more activityspecific

elu~idation

of the prehistoric lifeways in the area.

THE TESTING PROGRAM
Introduction
Minor tests were conducted at five sites during the survey (WM 197,
203, 214, 215, 263).

Both machine and hand tests were used in an attempt

to solve basic problems regarding extent, depth and potential for further
excavation at each site.

Site 41 WM 197
This small, partially collapsed rockshelter is located on the south
bank of the Middle Fork of the San Gabriel.

river.

The floor of the shelter is only slightly higher than the surrounding

flood plain.

Results:
Two minor subsurface probes in the two chambers of Site 41 WM 197, a
small rockshelter, resulted in definition of cultural debris at least 1.5
feet thick,

Areas of burning, evidenced by charcoal staining were encountered

in Levels 2, 3, and 4 in Test Pit 2 (in the north chamber).
A possible hearth, consisting of layers of flat limestone spalls, was
encountered near the southeast corner of Test Pit 1 1.5 feet below present
surface (Level 3).

The hearth measured about 1 foot in diameter.

Diagnostic

projectile points recovered from these tests (Granbury bona and Young arrow
points) would suggest a Late Prehistoric occupation of the site; the presence
of a single Pedernales dart point base on the surface may indicate some mixing,
but the presence of this one specimen does not strongly bias the feeling of
a Late Prehistoric occupation as evidenced in the midden zone represented
ca. 1.5 feet below present ground surface.
Bone recovered from the matrix was examined and identified.

Species

represented in the sample (all of which came from the upper levels (O.O 1.0 foot) may represent modern deposition.

Recovery was not of a signifi-

cantly large sample and associations are supported exclusively by prehistoric
materials found at similar levels.

The bulk of specimens identified as ab-

orig!nal in origin came from the third level (that is, 1.0 - 1.5 feet).

Addi-

tional testing within and in front of the shelter should confirm and define
the extent and depth of occupation; information as it now exists is inconclusive.

Site 41 WM 203
When this terrace site was first observed, only fired rock, shell and
flint debris were evident on the surface.

Its location 50 yards south of

51
the North Fork of the San Gabriel suggested that it might have some depth.
In particular, the alluvial sediments in which the site lay appeared to be
the same as those at Site 41 WM 214 (Figs. 2, 12, 13).
A single 5-foot by 5-foot test pit was excavated in arbitrary 1/2 foot
levels.

Excavated material was screened.

Results
The single test pit excavated at this site was taken to a depth of 2
feet.

At this depth absolutely no cultural material was recovered.

Its

topographic similarity of situation to Site 41 WM 214 suggests that cultural
zones might be contacted at greater depths.

The only conclusions that can

be drawn regarding the small test is that surf ace material indicative of
aboriginal occupation was present but not abundant and that at a depth of
2 feet all cultural material stops.

Two other tested sites (WM 203 and WM 215)

Occupational debris was noticed

eroding from the face of the bank; therefore, initially, examination of the

The single test unit (4 feet x 8

feet) was excavated in increments of 0.5 of a foot.

Charcoal samples were

taken from lenses of charcoal evident in the faced bank; however, since these
samples were not found to be in association with any particular feature or
artifact, no series was run on them.

They are on file at the Texas Archeolog-

ical Research Laboratory, The University of Texas at Austin.

Snail shells, limestone spalls and a few flint flakes were found

within the matrix, but no artifacts.

is devoid of cultural material.
Stratum 3, a reddish-yellow zone, extends approximately 3 1/4 to 4 feet
deep.

Several features, including four

Actually, the stratum is bisected by the

cultural zone (Fig. 12).
The lowest stratum, 5, underlies the reddish-brown cultural layer.

A

lens of charcoal was recognized in the east wall and a lens of snails in
the south wall (Fig. 12).
Features
Four hearths were revealed in the course of testing.

These features con-

sisted of circular arrangemeats of limestone spalls or observed stone-lined
pits in the walls.

An ashy matrix filled the center and ranged around it.

The surrounding matrix was a burned red soil.

Snail shells and charcoal

were closely associated with them.
Feature 1:
This single layer hearth was encountered at 7.25-7.75 feet below present
ground surface.

The feature was manifested by fractured limestone spalls.

54
One of these spalls was on edge and may suggest that these rocks lined a
shallow depression.

Much charcoal was found beneath the hearthstones.

Soil

in the immediate area around the rocks was burned.
Feature 2:
A second hearth made up of limestone spalls was present in the east
wall of the unit at approximately the same depth as Feature 1 (Fig. 12).
Ashy soil and charcoal were associated with it.
Feature 3:
A lens of burned red soil and a gray-brown ashy soil were recognized
in the south wall (Fig. 12).

This is presumed to be the remnants of a hearth.

Feature 4:
A hearth in the west wall consisted of a layer of rocks over a layer of
charcoal.

The charcoal was underlain by a lens of burned yellow clay.

Both

Features 3 and 4 occurred at approximately the same level as the other f eatures.
Artifacts
Artifacts recovered from the excavation are made up of occasional flint
flakes in the upper levels (upper 6 feet).

The concentration of aboriginal

tools was located between Levels 16 and 18 (6.0-8.25 feet).

Again the concentration was between Levels 16 and 18 or those strata in which
features were revealed.
Results
A single test excavation at Site 41 WM 214 resulted in the recognition
of a single level occupation buried under approximately 7 feet of alluvial
sediments.

The site, which was identified by the cultural material eroding

from the face of the river bank, can be classed as a buried terrace site (a
common type along the river).

Time-diagnostic projectile points associated with the

occupation are three Fairland dart points.

With the chronological framework

established for the area, that occupation would be postulated as falling within the Late Prehistoric or about A.D. 1 to A.D. 600.
Future work at the site would enable us to examine a discrete unit of
occupation, if the indications from the test give an accurate picture of the
entire situation.

Site 41 WM 215
This burned rock midden is located on the south side of the North Fork
of the San Gabriel about 75-100 yards downstream from Site 41 WM 214 (Fig. 2).
It is situated on an older terrace than the one on which sites WM 203 and
WM 214 are located.

Also, this terrace is 7-9 feet higher in elevation.

A backhoe trench oriented approximately north-south was cut into the
midden on the south.

The trench was directed north toward the center and/or

highest point of the burned rock accumulation.

The back dirt from the trench

was searched and an abundance of burned rocks and snails were observed but
not collected.

Several time-diagnostic projectile points, Nolan, Martindale

and Tortugas were recovered from the trench backdirt.
Results
The midden accmnulation at this site is approximately 50 feet in diameter;
it had no discernible stratigraphic changes within it as seen in the backhoe
trench profile. What was. evidenced was a midden approximately 2 feet deep.
Matrix is composed of dark, organically-stained soil, flint flaked and burned
rock.

The time-diagnostic points (Nolan, Tortugas and Martindale) suggest

an early Archaic occupation (that is, perhaps between 6000 B.C. and 2000 B.C.).
Information on the ages of the point style& is derived from the chronological
data assembled at Stillhouse Hollow (Sorrow and others, 1967, Table 1).

Site 41 WM 263
Surface indications at this site, an open scatter on a bench of a tributary creek on the north side of the North Fork, suggested a horizontally extensive and perhaps vertically deep site.

The site, which is located in an open

area in Taylor Ray Hollow, is on the east side of the main creek.

An abun-

dance of cores, flakes and finished tools were strewn over the entire surface.
Two test pits (each 1 m. square) were dug in 10 cm. levels.

conducted during the Spring of 1974 and metric measurements were employed

to determine the stratigraphy and depth of fill at that point.

At the edge

of the site and the beginning of this erosional §ully, the top layer of soil
was seen to be only several centimeters thick before grading into a mottled
yellow clay and surface clayey loam stratum only to be underlain by yellow
clay with river gravels only several centimeters deeper.

The first test

pit was taken to a depth of 34 ems. at which point the yellow clay and gravels
were encountered.

With the exception of a Marshall dart point on the surface

at the pit, only a few tiny flint flakes were recovered.

At the north end

of the site, the upper zone was deeper; however, after clearing the surface
of the test area where an untyped dart point was found, only a few tiny flint
flakes were encountered in a excavated context.
Results
Two test pits were dug at Site 41 WM 263.

What had initially appeared

as a promising site with some depth was shown to be a def lated area and one
in which occupation was confined only to the surf ace.

The site is typical

of many found in the area and exemplifies what is described as "open scatter"
in the survey descriptions.

Evaluation of Testing
Limited testing at five sites (WM 197, WM 203, WM 214, WM 215 and WM
263) generated information regarding several different recognized site types
in the North Fork Reservoir area.
Temporally, the occupation at these various sites appear largely confined to the latter part of the Archaic.

An inherent problem arising from

the nature of such limited testing is the possibility of misinterpretation
based on a glimpse at a site.

Hypothetical periods of occupation are fre-

quently postulated on the basis of one or two time-diagnostic projectiles.
Therefore, minor subsurface probes verve better to form a basis of judgment
as to whether or not to pursue further excavation than they do as a source
of strong data for cultural reconstruction.
Site 41WM197, a small collapsed rockshelter occupies a vulnerable location only slightly above the flood plain of the Middle Fork of the San Gabriel.

Exposure of intact hearth remains suggests the probability of isolating an
extensive living surface, and, the few diagnostic artifacts recovered indicate

Identification of their use is

important to the elucidation of the prehistoric situation.
Excavation at Site WM 203 was initiated because of it topographic similarities to a deep terrace site, WM 214.

It is not felt that the 5-foot

square test pit was adequate to assess the nature of the site.

If indeed

there is a site buried under deep alluvial sediments , then a machine test
might be the only way to ascertain this.
The deep sediments covering Site WM 214 illustrate a problem associated
with site identification.

The fortuitous cirnumstance of eroding cultural

debris in the bank resulted in the identification of the site.

The presence

of an isolated cultural zone (at least 7.5 feet below present ground surface)
with intact features and artifact associations would encourage further work
at the site.

A single backhoe trench at Site WM 215 enabled the excavator to identify
a midden zone about 2 feet thick over a midden accumulation about 50 feet
in diameter.

As seen in the profile of the trench, the stratigraphy of the

site is confined to sterile deposits and a single zone containing cultural
material.
Brief tests at WM 263, an open scatter location, reconfirmed that these
sites are apparently confined to the surface.

RESEARCH DESIGN
The identification of the archeological resource base along the North
San Gabriel River is now closer to a reality because of the investigation
of a large segment of its physical manifestations which cover thousands of
years.
Examination of that segment of the drainage where the North Fork Dam and
Reservoir are being constructed has resulted in the location of 109 prehistoric
sites.

The variety of sites found in the area is diverse enough to warrant

individual attention.

With the task of location and preliminary evaluation

done, more serious attention should be paid to the retrieval of complementary
d~na

which would not only enhance the growing record of the North Fork Reser-

voir but supplement information being obtained downstream at the nearby Laneport Reservoir.

The fact that these two reservoirs, North Fork and Laneport,

are nearby on the same stream (Fig. 1), yet in clearly contrasting environmental situations, enhances the possibility for good comparative data.
The research orientation suggested is:
1.

A refinement of the chrortology.

Although a basic areal chronology

has been established (cf. Sorrow 1967), additional data from excavated contexts should refine and extend this time scale.

The location of a site such

as WM 214 which has several recognizable structural features (hearths) strengthens the possibility for extracting

well~assoeiated

dating samples and definable

cultural debris.
2.

The occurrence of burned rock middens and open scatter sites in

close proximity suggest a systemic relationship.
has yet to be demonstrated archeologically.

However, this suspicion

Do these open scatter sites

reflect the exploitation and utilization of good flint outcrops/colluvial
deposits near the main living areas (i.e. burned rock middens)?

Is the

scatter evidence of the utilization of areas off the major rock accumulation?
The contemporneity or lack of it between these two site types should be
investigated.

3.

Evidence of historic settlement along the San Gabriel drainage

although present has not been clearly defined.

It does, though, represent

an extension through time of the total settlement relationship of man to
the area and should be documented more completely.
4.

Is there a recognizable influence of physiographic variation (i.e.

the Edwards Plateau-Balcones Escarpment as opposed to the Coastal Plain)
on settlement and site types in the San Gabriel drainage?

The comparison

of the North Fork and Laneport data--each of which cover significant segments
of the San Gabriel River drainage--should aid in assessing this.
