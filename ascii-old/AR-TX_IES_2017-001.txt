ABSTRACT
This report documents the substantive findings and management recommendations of a
cultural resource inventory conducted by Integrated Environmental Solutions, LLC (IES)
for the American Airlines Trinity River Complex Building 6 Project, Dallas/Fort Worth
International Airport (DFW), Tarrant County, Texas. As the DFW will need approval
from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to modify their Airport Layout Plan to
reflect the permanent alterations, the project requires compliance with Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act. Additionally, as the DFW is a political subdivision
of the State of Texas, the project will be subjected to the provisions of the Antiquities
Code of Texas (ACT).
The goal of the survey was to locate, identify, and assess any cultural resources that could
be adversely affected by the proposed development, and to evaluate such resources for
their potential eligibility for listing as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) or eligibility
for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
The cultural resources inventory was conducted by archeologists Kevin Stone and Anne
Gibson on 23 May 2017, under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8034. During the IES
survey, one newly recorded prehistoric site (41TR304) was encountered within the 12.15acre Area of Potential Effects (APE). Based on the degree of disturbance, it was deemed
ineligible for listing on the NRHP or as a SAL. In addition, portions of the FAA Air
Route Traffic Control Center and the American Airlines Training and Convention Center
greater than 50 years in age were assessed within the indirect APE.
No artifacts were collected as part of this survey. All records will be temporarily curated
at the IES McKinney office and permanently curated at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL). No further work is warranted. However, if any cultural
resources are unearthed during construction, the operators should stop construction
activities, and immediately contact the project environmental representative to initiate
coordination with the Texas Historical Commission (THC) prior to resuming any
construction activities.

CHAPTER 1: PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This report has been written in accordance with the guidelines for reports prepared by the Council of
Texas Archeologists (CTA 2002). The report presents a brief description of the project area or Area of
Potential Effects (APE), environmental setting, and methodology; followed by the results of the
investigations and recommendations. This report serves as the cultural resources report to satisfy the
Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT).

1.1 Introduction
As the project cultural resources consultant for Crescent Real Estate Development, LLC (Crescent),
Integrated Environmental Solutions, LLC (IES) performed a cultural resources inventory to locate any
prehistoric or historic-period cultural resources that could be considered potentially eligible for inclusion
on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or listing as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL)
within the 12.15-acre APE. The APE was located southeast of the intersection of American Boulevard
and FAA Boulevard in Tarrant County, Texas. The project was plotted on recent aerial photograph and
the Euless 7.5-minute series U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Quadrangle sheet (Figures 1.1 and 1.2).
As the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) needed approval from the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) to modify their Airport Layout Plan (ALP) to reflect the permanent alterations, the
project will subsequently require compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). In addition, as the DFW is a political
subdivision of the State of Texas the project will be subjected to the provisions of the ACT.
The goal of the survey was to locate, identify, and assess the APE for previously unrecorded
archeological sites, buildings, structures, or other cultural resources for potential eligibility as a SAL or
NRHP listing. All work was conducted in accordance with 13 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) 26, and
with 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 60.4, which outline the regulations for implementing the
ACT and Section 106, respectively.

1.2 Area of Potential Effects
Direct APE
The direct APE for the project encompassed approximately 12.15 acres. Current project designs for the
American Airlines Trinity River Complex Building 6 (AA TR6) project call for the construction of a fourstory office building, a seven-level parking garage, a central utility plant, associated road infrastructure,
and landscaping (Appendix C). Ground disturbances associated with tree removal, grading, utility
installation, and paving are anticipated for this project. Although the extent of subsurface impacts is
unknown at this point, field investigations assessed to the depth of proposed construction or the bottom of
soils capable of containing cultural resources.
Indirect APE
As the project will require approval from the FAA, an assessment of indirect effects was required to
comply with the NHPA. The sole potential indirect effect of the undertaking was related to visual effects
associated with the construction of multiple above-ground buildings and structures. To account for
potential visual impacts associated with these above-ground elements, a 600-foot indirect APE was
considered surrounding the direct APE. Thus, any standing structure or building of historical age within
the direct and indirect APE was photographed and assessed for potential NRHP eligibility.

CHAPTER 2: ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
2.1 Environmental Setting
Climate
Tarrant County is in the North-Central part of the state of Texas. This region has a humid subtropical
climate and an annual rainfall averaging between approximately 35.01 to 40.00 inches. About half of the
rain usually falls between April and May, with July and August being the two driest months of the year.
The subtropical region tends to have a relatively mild year-round temperature with the occasional
exceedingly hot and cold snaps (Estaville and Earl 2008).
Topographic Setting
The USGS Euless 7.5â Quadrangle map illustrates that the APE is located on the southern margins of a
broad upland ridge that separates the West Fork Trinity River from Big Bear Creek. The headwaters to
an unnamed tributary are located within the western portion of the APE. The unnamed tributary flows
south and confluences with a second unnamed tributary located adjacent to the APEâs southern boundary.
The APE is located within a transitional topographic setting, which transitions from a very gently sloping
upland setting north of the APE to a steeply sloped setting south of the APE. The APE is directly
adjacent to developed urban land to the north and east; while dense woods are located to the west and
south.
Geology and Soils
The APE was located within an environmental interface, known as an ecotone, between the Northern
Blackland Prairie and Eastern Cross Timber ecoregions (Figure 2.1) (McGowen et al. 1987). Variation
among each ecoregion is a direct result of the underlying geology (Diggs et al. 1999). The natural divide
between these two geological formations parallels Big Bear Creek, which runs from the northwest to the
southeast through the western portion of the DFW property.
The Northern Blackland Prairie is characterized by low-relief topography containing dark, thick, plastic
clay soils typical of the Houston Black, Heiden, and Wilson soil series (Ressel 1981). The Eagle Ford
Formation (Kef) underlies these soils, which is the westernmost and oldest geological group within the
Blackland Prairies (McGowen et al. 1987). This formation dates to the late Cretaceous and is comprised
of sedimentary rock consisting of shale, siltstone, and limestone, which grades upward into highly plastic
clay (McGowen et al. 1987, USGS 2017).
The Eastern Cross Timbers region was historically characterized by a narrow strip of timbered, low hills
that are orientated along a north/south axis spanning Tishomingo, Oklahoma to Waco, Texas (Ferring
1994; McGowen et al. 1987). This region contains countless hills that were once heavily wooded and
contained oak, walnut, blackjack, and hickory trees that grow in deep sandy soil (Hill 1901). Early
pioneers referred to the region as the Monte Grande (Grand Forest) and later the Lower Timbers.
However, due to urban expansion, agricultural development, and other modern activities, the natural
vegetation has become highly fragmented and only a few large tracts of undisturbed woodlands remains
today (Griffith et al. 2007). The APE was underlain by the Woodbine (Kwb) geological formation. The
Woodbine dates back to the Late Cretaceous and primarily consists of sandstone and contains a small
percentage of siltstone, mudstone, and clay (Griffith et al. 2007; McGowen et al. 1987).
As shown by the Soil Survey of Tarrant County, Texas, there are three mapped soils within the APE
(Figure 2.2; Table 2.1) (Ressel 1981). Approximately 96.7 percent of the APE contains soils typical of
upland settings within the Northern Blackland Prairie and Eastern Cross Timbers regions. The remaining
3.3 percent pertains to frequently flooded soils near unnamed tributaries of West Fork Trinity River. Soil
data was viewed from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) NRCS Web Soil Survey (Web Soil
Survey 2017).

CHAPTER 3: CULTURAL BACKGROUND
3.1 Previous Investigations
A file search within the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) maintained by the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) identified that there are no previously recorded archeological sites, National Register
Historic Properties, historical markers, or cemeteries were located within or directly adjacent to the APE
(TASA 2017). According to the TASA records, there is one previously recorded archeological site and
three previously conducted cultural surveys located within one-mile (~1,600 meter [m]) of the APE
(Tables 3.1 and 3.2; Figure 3.1).

3.2 Cultural Resources Potential
In addition to the TASA review, several additional sources were referenced to determine the overall
potential for encountering cultural resources within the APE. These sources included the Soil Survey of
Tarrant County, Texas, the Geologic Atlas of Texas, Dallas Sheet, the USGS topographic map, the NRCS
digital soil database for Tarrant County, the Potential Archeological Liability Map (PALM), the National
Archives and Records Administrationâs (NARA) 1940 Census Enumeration District Maps for Tarrant
County, the Texas Historic Overlay (THO) georeferenced maps, and both past and current aerial
photography.
Direct APE
Prehistoric Resource Potential

Data presented within the PALM for Tarrant County indicates the vast majority of the APE contains a
low potential for containing shallow and deeply buried cultural materials within a reasonable context.
The southern boundary of the APE, closest to the unnamed tributary, contains moderate to high potential
for containing prehistoric materials. Historical aerial photography illustrates the APE as being largely
comprised of mixed woods as early as 1957. The vast majority of the APE has remained undeveloped
until modern day. However, between 1979 and 1990, an approximate 0.8-acre area within the northeast
corner of the APE was cleared and converted to a parking and storage space. In addition, the eastern
margins of the APE are located within the footprint of existing roads and parking lots for the American
Airlines Training and Conference Center (AA TCC). As such, the vast majority of the APE contains a
reasonable context and features a low to high potential for containing prehistoric archeological sites.

Historic-Period Resource Potential

Historical maps indicated the APE was void of historic-period resources as early as 1920. This was
visually confirmed through historical aerial photography from 1957, and modern aerial interpretations.
Although potential exists for historic-aged resources to have been constructed and demolished within the
APE prior to 1957, the APEâs distance from historical roads lends to a low probability of this occurrence.
Indirect APE Resource Potential
During background review, two building complexes were identified east and north of the direct APE. The
eastern complex is the AA TCC. While the vast majority of the construction within the AA TCC has
occurred within the last 50 years, portions of the AA TCC that were constructed as part of the first two
phases of construction (1953 to 1957 and 1963 to 1968) are greater than 50 years in age and are within the
viewshed of the AA TR6 APE.
The northern complex is the FAA ARTCC. The majority of the general development has occurred within
the last 50 years, which includes the construction of new buildings, building additions, parking lots, and
roadways. However, portions of the campus are greater than 50 years in age (circa 1957 to 1963) and are
in the viewshed of the AA TR6 APE.

CHAPTER 4: METHODOLOGY
The archeological inventory for the AA TR6 Project was conducted on 23 May 2017. The methods and
density of excavating shovel tests met the minimum requirements for field operations stipulated by the
THC and CTA Archeological Survey Standards for Texas. Prior to field work, the IES staff conducted a
historical and archeological records search to determine what cultural resources have been recorded
within the APE and within a one-mile radius of the APE. This information was detailed in Chapter 3.
Additionally, IES staff reviewed ecological, geological, soils data, as well as, historical and recent
topographic maps and aerial photography.

4.1 Survey Methods
The 100 percent intensive pedestrian survey consisted of a careful examination of the ground surface and
existing subsurface exposures for evidence of archeological sites within the APE. The survey consisted
of a multiple transect scheme with transect lines spaced at 30 m intervals orientated east and west across
the APE. Areas displaying high levels of disturbance were photographed to document the lack of
potential for intact archeological deposits. Other documentation methods included narrative notes, maps,
and shovel test records.

4.2 Shovel Testing
In areas with potential for archeological materials, shovel tests were excavated to 80 centimeters (cm) or
the bottom of culturally sterile deposits, whichever was encountered first, unless otherwise specified.
Each shovel test was 30 cm in diameter and was hand excavated in natural stratigraphic levels not
exceeding 20 cm in thickness. Excavated soil was screened using Â¼-inch hardware cloth to test for the
presences of buried cultural material. All tests were recorded on maps and plotted using hand-help
Global Positioning System (GPS) units. Investigators documented the results of each test on standardized
shovel test forms. According to the Archeological Survey Standards of Texas, for projects displaying
little to no disturbance, an APE larger than 10 acres requires one shovel tests per two acres. As such, an
APE of 12.15-acres requires six shovel tests. All positive shovel tests, cultural features, and other site
data were geospatially recorded using Trimble Geo XT handheld GPS unit.
Standards for archeological methods require that measurements be recorded in metric units. For this
reason, while general distances and engineering specifications are described in feet or miles within this
report, archeological measurements and observations are listed in meters or centimeters, unless artifact
diagnostic elements must be presented within Imperial unit measurements.

4.3 Site Recording
Archeological site delineation standards require that no fewer than six shovel tests (when applicable) are
required to assess the horizontal extent and to characterize the depth of archeological deposits. Negative
shovel tests, the distribution of surficial artifacts/features, topography, and/or the APE extent delineated
the boundaries of each site. For the purposes of this survey, an archeological site was defined as five or
more surface artifacts within a 10 m radius, a cultural feature observed on the surface or exposed during
shovel testing, a positive shovel test containing two or more subsurface artifacts, or two or more positive
shovel tests located within 30 m of each other. All newly-documented sites were assigned a temporary
field number and were recorded on State of Texas Archeological Site Data forms.

4.4 Site Assessment
A scaled map was prepared for each identified archeological site, and each site was plotted on the
appropriate 7.5-minute USGS topographic map. The data from any encountered site was recorded in the
field was processed at the IES office in McKinney, Texas to determine site significance and potential
NRHP eligibility. When applicable, a variety of data was used to assess site significance including
date(s), artifact density, artifact variety, features density, feature variety, feature preservation, and
stratigraphic integrity.

4.5 National Register Evaluation Criteria
When evaluated within its historic context, a cultural resource property must be shown to be significant
for one or more of the four criteria for evaluation (A, B, C, or D) (36 CFR 60.4 [a-d]). These criteria
pertain to cultural resource properties, which include districts, sites, buildings, structures, objects:
Criterion A:

that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad
patterns of our history; or

Criterion B:

that are association with the lives of persons significant in our past; or

Criterion C:

that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or
that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a
significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction;
or

Criterion D:

that have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or
history.

Overall, the property must also retain the defining features and characteristics that were present during the
propertyâs period of significance to be considered eligible NRHP listing. The NRHP defines seven
aspects of integrity as; location, setting, design, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association.

4.6 Curation
The survey employed a non-collection strategy. Records, files, field notes, forms, and other
documentation will be included in the curation package. All field-generated documents will be
temporarily curated at the IES office and permanently curated at TARL. These documents and
photographs will be organized and catalogued according to TARL curation standards.

CHAPTER 5: RESULTS
During the pedestrian survey, archeological site delineation, and architectural assessment, one
archeological site (41TR304) was encountered within the 12.15-acre direct APE. In addition, two
properties were assessed for potential visual impacts within the indirect APE. Shovel test locations and
archeological site boundaries are illustrated in Figures 5.1 and 5.2, a photograph location map and
photographs are located in Appendices A and B, engineering designs are in Appendix C, and a site
location map in Appendix D.

5.1 Archeological Survey
Survey Observations
Past Disturbances within APE

Historical and modern aerial photographs assessed during background research verified that the majority
of the APE avoided significant ground disturbances between 1953 and 2016. Aerial photography from
1953 illustrated that the APE was dominated by mixed woods and contained two small tributaries.
Through time, various footpaths and unimproved roads began to crisscross the project area, which
resulted in minor surficial disturbances within very limited portions of the APE. The Stewardess College
(part of the current day AA TCC campus) was constructed directly east of the APE in 1957. As the AA
TCC campus expanded through time, a large parking lot and private road were constructed within the
eastern margins of the APE between 1958 and 1970. Between 1957 and 1962, the FAA ARTCC campus
was constructed adjacent to the APEâs northern boundary, but appeared to not have caused any
disturbance within the APE. Between 1970 and 1979, construction of American Boulevard impacted the
APEâs western edge. Between 1979 and 1990, an overhead transmission line and small parking lot
resulted in ground disturbance along the northern boundary of the APE. The most significant ground
disturbances occurred within a few months prior to the IES survey. Recent activities including tree
grubbing and grading have disturbed the majority of the APE. At the time of the survey the vast majority
of the woods had been removed and mulched. The woods that once dominated the APE were restricted to
a thin corridor along the APE boundary and remnants tree mottes within the center of the APE. Pockets
of less disturbed areas were located along the transition between grubbed areas and the wooded APE
margins (Appendix A, Photographs 1 through 20).
Shovel Testing

During the pedestrian survey, one positive and 13 negative shovel tests were excavated (see Figure 5.1).
Shovel testing was conducted within portions of the APE that could contain buried cultural deposits,
which was determined to be within an approximate four-acre area along the APE margins. The remaining
portion of the APE was determined to have been significantly disturbed and contained negligible potential
for subsurface cultural deposits. Subsequently, these areas were visually assessed and photographed
during transect survey. As grubbing and grading had recently occurred, the groundâs surface visibility
was near 100 percent within the vast majority of the APE.
Shovel testing revealed a soil profile that transitioned from a loose sandy loam overlaying a compact
sandy clay loam, located within the southern half of the APE, to clay loam soil within northern half. Soils
ranged from a dark brownish black (10YR 3/2) near the surface to a brown (10YR 4/3 and 10YR 4/4)
lying over a compact, reddish-brown (7.5 YR 4/5 and 7.5 YR 4/6) soil. As a result of shallow Holocene
aged soils, the maximum depth of the shovel tests was approximately 30 cmbs with the majority
terminating between 20 to 30 cmbs. Shovel tests excavated near the southern boundary of the APE, and
contained the sandy loam matrix, contained significantly higher amount of gravel than the clay loam
within the northern half of the APE.

Encountered Resources
41TR304
During the IES survey, a newly recorded prehistoric site (41TR304) was encountered within the southcentral portion of the APE (see Figure 5-2). Through the delineation it was determined the site extended
approximately 44 m north-to-south and 22 m east-to-west and was comprised of an ephemeral surface and
subsurface accumulation of lithic flakes and shatter. No archeological features were observed.
Topographically, the site was situated along the slope of a ridge adjacent to an unnamed tributary to the
Trinity River located approximately 520 feet to the south. The site was primarily located within a heavily
disturbed setting that contained near 100 percent surface visibility (Appendix A, Photographs 25, 29,
and 30). Shovel testing was conducted within areas that had been less affected by recent ground
disturbances and within small pockets of undisturbed land. Due to the siteâs location near the APEâs
boundary, portions of the site may be present outside the APE.
Past Ground Disturbances

As discussed previously, the most significant ground disturbances affecting the APE have transpired
recently and affected the vast majority of the recorded site. Recent tree grubbing and grading has resulted
in near 100 percent surface visibility across the majority of the site. While the vast majority of the site
has been disturbed, the ground disturbances vary across the site with the most significant located near the
northern third of the site. The central and southern portions of the site were within a wooded setting, that
had been affected less by ground clearing. While ground disturbances were less, the majority of these
areas still contained very high ground visibility caused by underbrush removal and vehicular traffic.
Survey Observation and Shovel Testing

Through the excavation of seven delineation shovel tests, it was determined that the vast majority of
artifacts associated with the site were located on or just below the groundâs surface. During an inspection
of the surface, five secondary and tertiary stage chert flakes were encountered (Appendix A, Photograph
27). Shovel tests were excavated to assist in determining the horizontal and vertical limits of the site, in
conjunction with surface observations. Of the seven shovel tests excavated, only one tested positive for
buried cultural materials. Within the positive shovel test, two lithic flakes were encountered between 0 to
20 cmbs (Appendix A, Photograph 28). The two chert flakes represented secondary and tertiary lithic
tool reduction.
Shovel testing within the site encountered a variable soil column that ranged from an approximate 10 cm
thick humate layer (10YR 4/3) over a compact strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) sandy clay loam to an
approximate 30 cm thick loose sandy matrix (10YR 4/4) over compact sandy clay loam (7.5 YR 4/6).
Thin deposits of gravel were interspersed with the sandy loam soils.
As mentioned previously, site delineation shovel tests were targeted within areas that displayed less
disturbance or were within relatively undisturbed pockets of mixed woods. As such, the shovel test data
provides a reliable assessment of the siteâs subsurface composition prior to the recent ground
disturbances. For these reasons, it can be assumed that the siteâs surface to near surface composition and
low-density accumulation that was documented by IES, was likely the siteâs condition prior to the recent
ground disturbances (Appendix A, Photograph 26).
Site Summary

Site 41TR304 was a newly recorded prehistoric site with an ephemeral scatter of lithic material of an
undetermined period. The site is located north of an unnamed tributary to the West Fork Trinity River
and measured approximately 44 m by 22 m. Seven shovel tests were excavated during the delineation of
the site and one tested positive for cultural material. A total of seven lithic flakes were encountered
within the site.

5.2 Architectural Resource Assessment
Direct APE Assessment
Through the reconnaissance survey, no buildings were encountered within the direct APE. However, a
private road and parking lot associated with the AA TCC were identified within the direct APE footprint.
Although these features were of historic-age and associated with the AA TCCâs 1958 to 1970 phase of
construction, these features were determined to be minimal elements of the AA TCC later construction
phase and were not assessed as direct APE architectural resources.
Indirect APE Assessment
To satisfy Section 106 requirements, indirect visual impacts must be assessed. Through coordination
with the THC History Program and Architecture Divisions an indirect APE was developed that
incorporated a 600-foot area outside the direct APE footprint. The indirect APE was designed to include
the maximum distance any adverse visual impacts could occur for a seven-level parking garage.
Through the indirect APE assessment, two historic-aged architectural resources (AR) were identified
(Figure 5.3). The two properties within the indirect APE pertained to the FAA ARTCC and AA TCC
and consisted of large campuses containing a mixture of historic-aged and modern buildings. Although
both properties have retained their original phase of construction, the original elements have been
expanded upon or surrounded by subsequent phases of construction. Each resourceâs architectural
characteristics are summarized in Table 5.1. Several modern commercial and residential buildings were
located within the indirect APE; however, these were modern and not assessed for potential NRHP
eligibility. The limits of the indirect APE were verified in coordination with the THC, to ensure that no
properties outside this distance could be adversely affected by the undertaking.

Identified Resources

5.2.2.1.1 AR-1: American Airlines Training and Conference Center

The AA TCC was located directly adjacent to the APE and was southwest of the intersection of State
Highway 360 and FAA Boulevard. The complex, composed of multiple buildings, was built for the AA
SC in 1957. Although, the AA was headquartered in New York, through the persuasive efforts of Fort
Worth businessman Amon G. Carter, AA decided to move their regional offices to Fort Worth from their
rival city of Dallas. Due to a favorable climate and an ideal central location near an expanding airport and
major urban centers, AA gradually transferred and centralized their offices and resources to the area west
of the Greater Southwest International Airport (GSW), southwest of the present day DFW.
Prior to the establishment of the SC, young women trained to become stewardesses in an airport hangar in
Chicago. Due to the poor condition of the Chicago facilities and the need to attract more women to be
stewardesses for the growing commercial airlines industry, AA established the worldâs first college for
stewardesses on a scenic property in Fort Worth. The new SC offered six weeks in courses covering
airplane designs, emergency procedures, grooming, and etiquette. In later years, psychology, cabin
pressurization, fire-fighting, and memory by association were added to the curriculum. The establishment
of the SC started a trend among the airline industry and resulted in the opening of other stewardess
colleges including the Braniff Stewardess College located at 2801 Wycliff Avenue southeast of Dallas
Love Field Airport.
The original building was designed by the architectural firms of Hedrick and Stanley in the modern style
of the mid-century period. The namesake of the architectural firm of Hedrick and Stanley were Wyatt C.
Hedrick and Thomas E. Stanley. Wyatt Hedrick was a prominent architect, who is most famous for his
Moderne or Art Deco (1920 to 1930s) masterpieces in Fort Worth and for designing several Texas
courthouses. Among his more notable works in Fort Worth are the Texas and Pacific Terminal and
Warehouse, Will Rogers Memorial Center, the Historic Electric Building, U.S. Post Office, and
Petroleum Building. Over 20 of Hedrickâs architectural works are currently listed on the NRHP. While
in Houston, Hedrick met a young, talented architect by the name of Thomas E. Stanley, whom was hired
on the spot after Hedrick looked at his drawings. Thomas Stanley moved to Fort Worth in 1951 as
partner in the firm of Hedrick and Stanley. Stanley was known for his minimalist classical styles, most
notably simple white colonnades in front of a dark background. He was the main architect of the AA
Flight Training Academy north of the SC. Like his mentor Hedrick, Stanley has several works that are
NRHP listed.
In the late 1960s, the beginning of the jumbo jet era required more stewardesses to attend to an increase in
passengers. To address these demands, a $5 million expansion of the facilities to increase capacity from
150 women to 500 was proposed. By 1970, the expanded college included three new buildings housing
additional classrooms and dormitories and original building was renovated. In 1972, the name of the
college changed to the AA Flight Service College to reflect the changing of terms from âstewardessâ to
âflight attendantâ as a result of men entering the profession.
The campus was expanded again between 1971 and 1990 with the addition of a parking lot west of the
main buildings. In the early 1990s, a building and associated parking lot were added on the north side of
the campus. After 1996, a new set of tennis courts and basketball courts were installed in the southwest
corner of the complex.

5.2.2.1.2 Existing Conditions

The AA TCC consists of a multi-building campus that has undergone several phases of construction since
its original phase was completed (Figure 5.4). The original phase was for the SC and was completed in
1957. The SC was constructed on a wooded 22-acre property located directly west from the GSW. The
most notable features of the building were the walls made of flag stone, which came from then 100-year
old ranch fences from Hood County, and tall glass windows overlooking the patio and pool. Costing
around a million dollars, the country club-like SC campus included classrooms, dormitories, a recreation
room, a kitchen, a beauty salon, a patio for sun bathing and dining, swimming pool, tennis courts, a pitchand-putt golf course, and walking trails. While some of the contributing elements of the SC have been
removed (i.e. pitch-and-putt golf course) many of the elements remain today. As such, it was determined
that the original SC component of the AA TCC campus would be easily recognizable by the SCâs first
graduating class and therefore has retained a high degree of cultural integrity. While later phases of
construction are of historic-age, they were designed and built by a different architectural firm that
constructed the buildings in a more generic style and with common materials.
AR-2: FAA Air Route Traffic Control Center
The FAA ARTCC is currently an operational, multi-building complex located directly north of the APE
and southeast of the intersection of FAA Boulevard and American Boulevard. The center was first
proposed by the FAA in 1959 to handle an increasing amount of air traffic in the Dallas/Fort Worth area.
The FAA ARTCC went into operation April 5, 1962. The new center was initially responsible for air
traffic within a 100,000 square mile radius that included much of north Texas and parts of Oklahoma,
Arkansas, and Louisiana. The FAA ARTCC was designed to be a self-contained unit that could continue
operating if there ever was a nuclear attack. The main building was reinforced with 18 to 24 inches of
concrete walls and a sprayer system on the roof to wash away any fall out. The latest equipment and
state-of-the-art computer systems were installed and upgraded about every decade. Through our research,
no well-known architects were identified in association with the campusâ original construction or later
phases.
5.2.2.2.1 Existing Conditions

The FAA ARTCC consists of a multi-building campus that has undergone several phases of construction
since its original phase was completed (Figure 5.5). The first expansion occurred in the 1970s that
included an additional wing to hold computer equipment for the centerâs automated air traffic control
system and more parking lots. In the 1980s, the center was expanded with another wing and an auxiliary
building to the east. From the 1990s to present, two new wings to the main building, several small
outbuildings around the periphery of the complex, and more parking lots were added. Neither the original
campus nor subsequent phases contained more unique architectural design or materials. These later
construction phases have resulted in an amorphous expansion of the campusâ original construction. Due
to FAA security requirements, photographs could not be easily obtained within the FAA campus. The
few photographs provided within Appendix B were taken from adjacent properties.

CHAPTER 6: NRHP ELIGIBILITY RECOMMENDATIONS
During the pedestrian survey and site delineation, one positive shovel test and 13 negative shovel tests
were excavated within the approximate 12.15-acre APE. As a result of the survey, one newly recorded
archeological site was encountered within the direct APE and two historic-aged architectural resources
were identified within the indirect APE. The eligibility recommendations of the identified cultural
resources identified are briefly summarized in Tables 6.1 and 6.2.

6.1 Direct APE
41TR304 was a newly recorded prehistoric site containing a low-density lithic scatter from an
undetermined period. During the site delineation, seven lithic flakes were encountered on the
groundâs surface and within a single shovel test. Due to the low potential to yield significant
archeological data and the poor level of site integrity, site 41TR304 was recommended as ineligible
for listing on the NRHP; nor should it be considered for SAL designation. However, based on a
positive shovel test and surface observation near the APE boundary, itâs possible the siteâs boundary
extend beyond the APE. As such, the unknown portion of the site outside the APE is of
undetermined eligibility.

6.2 Indirect APE
AR-1 was documented as a multiple-building property associated with the AA TCC campus. Since its
original phase of construction, which was completed in 1957 for the SC, the campus has undergone
four other phases of construction that have occurred as recently as 1996. The SC was the first of its
kind and was responsible for assisting in the growth and popularity of AA, as well as, establishing a
trend that transformed the airline industry as a whole. The original phase of construction was
designed by the Hedrick and Stanley architectural firm. Wyatt C. Hedrick and Thomas E. Stanley
were prominent architects within the Dallas/Fort Worth region and nationally. Hedrick and Stanley
are responsible for designing numerous properties that are listed or nominated for listing in the
NRHP. Although the SC has been expanded upon through time, the original SC construction phase
has retained a high degree of integrity of design and materials and would be easily recognizable by
the architects and early SC attendees. For these reasons, the AA TCC Construction Phase 1
(Stewardess College) was recommended as eligible for NRHP listing under Criteria A and C. The
subsequent AA TCC Construction Phases 2 through 5 were recommended as ineligible for NRHP
listing.

AR-2 was documented as a multiple-building property associated with the FAA ARTCC campus. Since
its original phase of construction, which was completed in 1962, the campus has undergone four
additional phases of construction that have occurred as recently as 1996. While the majority of the
FAA ARTCC campus is of historic-age, the campus has expanded amorphously through time.
Neither the original campus nor subsequent phases contained unique architectural design or materials.
While the FAA ARTCC has played a role in the growth of the DFW International Airport, the
contributions are not individually significant. No well-known or prominent architects were associated
with the FAA ARTCC design and construction. For these reasons, the FAA ARTCC was
recommended as ineligible for NRHP listing.

CHAPTER 7: CONCLUSIONS
7.1 Adverse Effects Assessment
The adverse effects determinations for the cultural resources identified within the direct and indirect APE
are briefly summarized below within Tables 7.1 and 7.2 and detailed within the following chapter. It is
the recommendation of IES that the SHPO concur with the following adverse effect determinations.

Archeological
Through the archeological survey, one prehistoric site from an unknown period was documented within
the direct APE and assigned the state trinomial number 41TR304. Through the siteâs delineation, it was
determined that the archeological deposits were comprised of a low-density scattering of artifacts that
were general in nature and illustrated a low potential for yielding significant archeological data. IES
considers 100 percent of the APE to be fully assessed for archeological resources at this time and the
resources identified during that survey can be considered complete inventory. No further work warranted.
No Adverse Effect determined.
Architectural Resources
Indirect APE

Through the assessment, two resources were identified within the indirect APE; one architectural resource
was determined to be eligible for NRHP listing. This resource pertained to the SC, which was the
original construction phase of AR-1 (AA TCC). Since the overall mass, scale/proportion, and height of
the proposed undertaking will be compatible with the surrounding area the proposed undertaking would
not diminish the cultural integrity of the SC. The FAA ARTCC (AR-2) was determined to be ineligible
for NRHP listing. IES considers 100 percent of the indirect APE to be fully assessed for architectural
resources at this time and the resources identified during that survey can be considered a complete
inventory. No further work warranted. No Adverse Effect determined.

7.2 Final Recommendation
For these reasons, IES is requesting concurrence for the APE, and that no historic properties are affected
under 36 CFR 800.4(d)(1). It is the recommendation of IES that the State Historic Preservation Officer
(SHPO), represented by the THC, concur with these findings and the project be permitted to continue
without the need for further cultural resource investigations. However, if any cultural resources (other
than those detailed within this report) are unearthed during construction, the operators should cease work
immediately in that area. The project environmental consultant should then be contacted to initiate
further consultation with the THC prior to resuming construction activities.
