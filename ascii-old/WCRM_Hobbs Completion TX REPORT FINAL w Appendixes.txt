ABSTRACT
Between December 2007 and November 2009, Western Cultural Resource Management, Inc.
performed various archaeological tasks in Texas as part of the Hobbs to El Paso Completion project for
AT&T. Eight thousand one hundred sixty-nine meters of construction activities were monitored, including
2,869 m of site area and 5,300 m of nonsite area. Thirteen sites were monitored during construction, eight of
which are updated in this report. The eight sites are on land managed by Guadalupe Mountains National
Park (GMNP [41CU667), GMNP/private (41CU646 and 41CU651), Texas Department of Transportation/
private (41CU748), and private landowners (41CU647, 41CU648, 41CU649, and 41CU660). Three of the
monitored sites (41CU647, 41CU648, and 41CU651) were also temporarily fenced during construction. One
reroute, 20 new ingress/egress routes, 21 areas of additional work space, and 30 rock piles/water bars in five
locations outside the ROW were surveyed (259.3 acres). One new site was discovered, but because of
private landowner concerns, it was not recorded. New features on two previously recorded sites (41CU648
and 41CU748) were discovered and documented. National Register of Historic Places eligibility
recommendations for 12 of the 13 sites did not change as a result of the work. Nine sites were recommended
to remain eligible under criterion (d), one site under criterion (a), and two sites under criteria (a) and (d); and
one site that had been recommended only under criterion (d) was recommended eligible under both criteria
(a) and (d). Seventeen isolated occurrences were identified. No additional work is recommended for this
project.

INTRODUCTION
Administrative Background
This report documents the results of survey of 20 ingress/egress (I/E) routes, 21 additional work
spaces and work space I/E routes, five locations containing 30 rock piles/water bars, and one short reroute
(Nickel Creek); construction monitoring and the update of eight site forms; and the discovery of 17 isolated
occurrences (IOs) in the Texas portion of the Hobbs to El Paso Completion Project, a phase of the larger
AT&T NexGen/Core Project. This report is one of 15 documents produced for the AT&T NexGen/Core
Project by Western Cultural Resource Management, Inc. (WCRM) that describe cultural resource
investigations for the Texas portion of the project. Other reports include Fiske (2008); Jones (2008); Jones
(2009); Kearns and Berrigan (2001); Kearns et al. (2001a, 2001b, 2001c); Kearns et al. (2003); Proper
(2005); Smith (2005); Smith and Wheeler (2003); Sullivan-Owens (2008); and Wheeler (2001, 2004).
Principal investigator for the project was Thomas J. Lennon. Construction monitoring in Texas was
performed by WCRM staff archaeologists Robert Fiske, Virginia Foster, Amy Hammermeister, Joshua G.
Jones, Ruth Martinez, Katharine Moreland, Michael J. Proper, Grant C. Smith, and Dorothy L. Webb.
Monitoring was under the supervision of administrative manager Charles W. Wheeler and assistant project
manager Joshua G. Jones. Work took place between December 2007 and November 2009. The Bureau of
Land Management (BLM) served as lead agency, and Land Services Inc. (LSI) served as third party
representative for the BLM. Fieldwork was done under the authority of Texas Historical Commission (THC)
Antiquities Permit No. 5317 and New Mexico BLM (lead agency) Cultural Resource Use Permit Nos. 25Â­
2920-07-EE, 25-2920-08-FF, 25-2920-08-GG, 25-2920-09-HH, 25-2920-09-II, 25-2920-09-JJ. AT&T Corp.
was the proponent of the project, and MasTec and B&H Maintenance and Construction, Inc. served as the
two main construction contractors.
This report is submitted in compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of
1966, as amended, and its enacting regulations. Because the report is part of a series of reports describing
cultural resource investigations in Texas, it incorporates by reference the description of the environment,
field methods, cultural history, and other background information that has been presented in the larger
project reports (Kearns et al. 2001a; Kearns et al. 2003). Appended to this report are topographic maps
showing site locations (Appendix A) and site forms for eight sites documented herein (Appendix B). Both
appendixes are for agency use only.
Project Description
The AT&T NexGen/Core Project is a fiber optic line extending from Lamesa, Texas to Los Angeles,
California. It is part of a larger project initiated to upgrade the AT&T fiber optic network across the United
States. WCRM was ultimately responsible for mitigating adverse effects to cultural resources located
between Lamesa, Texas and Blythe, California (Figure 1). This included sites in western Texas, southern
New Mexico, southern Arizona, and eastern California. Although construction began in 2001, construction
within the eastern portion of New Mexico and western Texas was halted in 2003 and not completed. Work
was restarted in Texas in December 2007 and was completed in November 2009. The western portion of
Texas where construction had not been completed extended from the TexasâNew Mexico state line northeast
of Guadalupe Mountains National Park (GMNP) to the Rio Grande on the western side of El Paso.
Pedestrian Surveys
The project generally followed the earlier proposed right-of-way (ROW), and many of the earlier
approved I/E routes were reutilized (Proper 2005; Smith 2005, Wheeler 2001, 2004); however, 20 additional
I/E routes and 21 additional work spaces and work space I/E routes were necessary. Five locations
containing 30 rock piles/water bars that were constructed outside the ROW without approval were also

The minor reroute, Nickel Creek, was located adjacent to the ROW (see Figure 2 and Appendix A);
it was needed to remove a zigzag in the original ROW at the crossing of Nickel Creek. The reroute was
along the southern side of the ROW on the northern side of Nickel Creek and adjacent to the northern side of
the ROW on the southern side of Nickel Creek. The total reroute extended roughly 526 m (1,726 ft). On the
northern side of Nickel Creek, the survey area was triangular and the width ranged from 4.6 m (15 ft) to 91 m
(299 ft) with a 17.4 m (57 ft) buffer on the southeastern side. On the southern side of Nickel Creek, the
survey area was trapezoidal and the width ranged from 17.4 m (57 ft) to 24.3 m (80 ft) with a 17.4 m (57 ft)
buffer on both the southeastern and western sides. Roughly 5.9 acres were surveyed.
Construction Monitoring
In Texas, construction monitoring occurred within nonsite areas and in sites in the GMNP and Salt
Flat Dunes Area of Critical Concern (ACC) (see Appendix A; Table 1). Construction monitoring was
initially recommended as a form of treatment for four sites (41CU647, 41CU648, 41HZ581, and 41EP5487)
(Kearns et al. 2001a). Generally, monitoring was recommended in situations where a site was recommended
eligible for the NHRP but the ROW did not appear to contain significant cultural resources. Site 41HZ581
was disturbed during a previous phase of construction and described in the AT&T NexGen/Core Project
Texas monitoring and discovery report (Jones 2008). Site 41EP5487 was inadvertently recommended for
construction monitoring (Kearns et al. 2001a); however, it had already been disturbed by construction and
was described in the AT&T NexGen/Core Project damage assessment report (Kearns and Berrigan 2001).
Prior to the beginning of this phase of construction, LSI and GMNP personnel requested cultural
monitoring of construction activities in the park in both site and nonsite areas. Following the initial blading
of the ROW through the park, GMNP personnel indicated that future monitoring would be necessary only on
sites 41CU646, 41CU667, and 41CU649.
Monitoring was also performed as a preventive measure to ensure that the construction company
remained in the ROW. Monitoring was instituted at 41CU660 because of a construction incident involving
work outside the ROW and within the site boundary. Because of several prior incidents, AT&T also
requested a cultural monitor during postconstruction cleanup in the Salt Flat Dunes ACC, even though the
ROW through the ACC had been cleared for construction and was not recommended for monitoring (see
Table 1 and Appendix A).
Discoveries
Discoveries or "unanticipated cultural resources" were to be expected on an undertaking of the length
and magnitude of the NexGen/Core Project and ancillary projects. Discoveries were expected as a result of
construction monitoring, project modification (e.g., additional work space surveys), and unforeseen
circumstances.
Land Jurisdiction
Survey of a reroute, new I/E routes, additional work spaces, and construction monitoring occurred on
private, State of Texas, City of El Paso, and National Park Service property (Tables 2 and 3). Four thousand
eight hundred thirty-six meters were monitored, and 210.68 acres of reroute, I/E routes, additional work
spaces, and five areas containing rock piles/water bars outside the ROW were surveyed on private property;
24.09 acres of I/E routes were surveyed on City of El Paso property; 22.2 acres of I/E routes were surveyed
on State of Texas Land; and 2.35 acres were surveyed and 3,333 m were monitored for additional work
spaces on GMNP property.

Specific Recommendations
LSI and GMNP personnel requested cultural monitoring of all
construction activities in the park. All vehicles may cross without
a monitor. All earth-disturbing activities require monitoring.
Requires construction monitoring per GMNP. Pickups and
backhoes may cross without a monitor. Heavy equipment
crossings and all earth-disturbing activities require monitoring.

Requires construction monitoring per GMNP. Pickups and
backhoes may cross without a monitor. Heavy equipment
crossings and all earth-disturbing activities require monitoring.
Restrict construction to ROW and temporarily fence for 100 ft on
both sides of Segment 2 (i.e., the road determined to be the
Butterfield Trail). Requires construction monitoring per GMNP.
Pickups and backhoes may cross without a monitor. Heavy
equipment crossings and all earth-disturbing activities require
monitoring.
Monitoring is required during construction. In addition, a
temporary sediment fence will be placed along the eastern edge of
the ROW. Pickups and backhoes may cross without a monitor.
Heavy equipment crossings and all earth-disturbing activities
require monitoring.
Monitoring is required during construction. Temporary fences will
be placed along both sides of I/E Route TX-83B through the site.
Pickups and backhoes may cross without a monitor. Heavy
equipment crossings and all earth-disturbing activities require
monitoring.
Bladed road crosses the site; THC required monitoring of heavy
equipment use of the road.
LSI has requested cultural monitoring of all construction activities
in the park. All vehicles may cross without a monitor. All earthÂ­
disturbing activities require monitoring.
Requires construction monitoring per GMNP. Pickups and
backhoes may cross without a monitor. Heavy equipment
crossings and all earth-disturbing activities require monitoring.
Because the construction company was found removing fill dirt
from an arroyo within the site boundary, monitoring of vehicular
crossings of the site in the ROW and monitoring of the
construction of new water bars.
The Salt Flat Dunes ACC and associated sites were not originally
recommended for construction monitoring; however, following
initial construction, large arroyos formed in the ROW that required
backfilling. AT&T requested monitoring of the backfilling to
prevent the construction company from straying outside the ROW.

METHODS
Standard archaeological procedures were used for both the additional areas surveyed and
construction monitoring. The methods are described below.
Records Review
During the initial phase of the AT&T NexGen/Core Project, a file search was conducted at Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory. Files were also checked at the Texas Land Office, THC, and the Austin
Public Library to identify potentially historic features (Kearns et al. 2003). The literature search documented
245 previously recorded sites within one mile of the ROW in Texas. Thirty-nine of these sites were within
100 m of the project ROW. Thirteen previously recorded sites located within the project were reevaluated
during the current project. See Kearns et al. (2003) for complete details.
Surveys
Ingress/Egress Routes
I/E routes extended from paved or graveled roads to the AT&T ROW and usually followed existing
bladed or two-track roads. In some cases, ephemeral drainages were used. Usually a 12.2 m (40 ft) wide
corridor centered on the road was surveyed in two pedestrian transects (one down and one back). Generally,
if a cultural site was located, the site was recorded and the I/E route was denied. If isolated occurrences were
found, they were recorded and the I/E route was approved for use.

Nickel Creek Reroute, Additional Work Spaces, and Rock Piles/Water Bars
The reroute, additional work spaces, and rock piles/water bars were surveyed using pedestrian
transects spaced no more than 15 m apart. If an archaeological site was encountered, it was recorded and the
area denied for construction use. If isolated occurrences were encountered, they were recorded and
construction use of the area was approved.
Monitoring
Archaeological monitoring for the project followed conventional procedures for cultural resource
management. Complete procedures for monitoring are fully described in Appendix A of the treatment plan
(Kearns et al. 2001c). Briefly summarized, the archaeological monitor's responsibilities included the
following tasks:
â¢
â¢
â¢
â¢

Watching the construction process to prevent or document intentional or inadvertent deviation
from the project ROW or violation of restricted locales.
Observing land-altering actions by machinery (e.g., vegetation clearing, surface leveling,
potholing, and trenching), including removal of sediment from the cable trench and inspection of
the trench.
Identifying previously unknown cultural resources, stopping construction activities when cultural
resources were identified, providing an initial assessment and documentation of the resource, and
initiating the notification process.
Recording the date, location, and character of the construction activity.
Discoveries

Complete procedures for handling discovery situations are presented in Kearns et al. (2001c). The
following list of procedures has been abbreviated.
â¢
â¢
â¢
â¢
â¢

When a discovery was encountered, all construction activity in the immediate vicinity would
cease.
WCRM archaeological personnel would verify the discovery.
If the discovery was determined to be a significant cultural resource and the documentation of
the discovery would entail continued investigation, then an area of at least 10 m (33 ft)
surrounding the discovery would be fenced with safety fencing.
An initial discovery report would be completed by the archaeologist, and appropriate
government agencies would be notified.
Site record forms and excavation forms would be completed, as warranted, and submitted to the
appropriate clearinghouse facility and agencies.
RESULTS

Results of the surveys and construction monitoring are presented below. Eight thousand one
hundred sixty-nine meters of construction were monitored in Texas, including construction within 13 sites.
Surveys included a reroute, I/E routes, additional work spaces, and rock piles/water bars; survey of these
areas totaled 259.3 acres.
Construction Incidents
During this phase of the project, seven incidents involving construction contractors and cultural
resources occurred. Five incidents occurred in the Texas portion of the project and two incidents occurred in
the New Mexico portion (see Jones 2010). One of the incidents that occurred in New Mexico is described
below, because it resulted in a project shutdown in both Texas and New Mexico.
12

The first incident occurred on I/E route TX-88C west of the junction of U.S. Highway 62/180 and
State Route 54 (see Figure 2 and Appendix A). A subcontractor bladed an existing two-track road along a
fence line that had not been approved for access. Blading did not impact any sites. The subcontractor was
reprimanded and was not rehired for additional work on the project. Use of the route was approved with the
stipulation that all vehicles should stay on the existing route, and no off-route or off-ROW parking of
vehicles or equipment would be allowed.
The next incident occurred at the base of John's Hill where U.S. Highway 62/180 climbs out of Pow
Wow Canyon. An abandoned segment of the historic, paved El PasoâCarlsbad Highway (41CU661) that had
been previously cleared only for use as an I/E route was used as an additional work space, AW-19 (see
Figure 4 and Appendix A). Duct had been laid along the road prior to being placed in the trench. The end of
the duct extended roughly 600 ft past the end of the portion of the road that had been cleared for access.
After consultation with the THC and the BLM at the Carlsbad Field Office in New Mexico, it was decided
that given it was the first offense for the contractor and the site was a paved highway and not damaged by the
activity, the issue would be addressed with cultural retraining at the construction company's morning tailgate
safety meetings.
The next incident, which resulted in a projectwide shutdown, took place in the Guadalupe Ridge
ACC in New Mexico (Jones 2010). It is described here because it affected work in Texas. Employees from
the construction company entered the ACC that required monitoring and excavated a hand hole pit and a tieÂ­
in pit without a cultural monitor. Both areas were examined and no cultural resources were damaged.
AT&T voluntarily instituted a two-day, projectwide, construction shutdown for cultural sensitivity retraining.
The BLM concurred with AT&T's action (George MacDonell to Joshua Jones, email, September 4, 2008, on
file at WCRM).
Following the incident in New Mexico, an incident in Texas resulted in a shutdown in both the Texas
and New Mexico portions of the project. Archaeological site avoidance stakes blocking a portion of an I/E
route (TX-83B) that crossed site 41CU648 were moved, and the road was used by personnel from the
construction company after being told that the road could not be used without permission from WCRM (see
Figure 2 and Appendix A). The site was not impacted by the use of the road. AT&T voluntarily instituted
another two-day shutdown and cultural retraining. AT&T also requested two additional cultural monitors to
ensure that there were no further incidents. The THC had already requested that use of the road be
monitored and that photographs of the road be taken before, during, and after use (Debra Beene to Charles
Wheeler, email, October 2, 2008, on file at WCRM).
The next incident took place during a spot check of construction activity by WCRM personnel. They
found the construction company personnel removing recent loose sediment from the bottom of the
Guadalupe Arroyo within the site boundary of 41CU660, but outside the AT&T ROW (see Figure 2 and
Appendix A). The construction company had strayed from the ROW in the bottom of the wash and had
pushed up piles of sediment. They were then scooping up the dirt, reentering the ROW in the bottom of the
wash and driving on the ROW to deposit the fill in rills that had formed along the ROW. The area of
disturbance measured roughly 130 m along the bottom of the arroyo and approximately 11 m across the
width. The entire area of disturbance was within the loose sediment of the active Guadalupe Arroyo.
Examination of the disturbed area indicated that no artifacts or features were present. Because the
construction company was new to the project, it was decided that a projectwide shutdown was unnecessary.
A tailgate meeting was held and the construction crew was given environmental and cultural sensitivity
training.
Finally, five locations containing 30 rock piles/water bars were constructed outside the ROW
without approval (see Figure 2 and Appendix A; Table 4). Twenty-seven water bars were constructed of
rock that extended outside the ROW, and three piles of rock were stacked outside the ROW The areas were
surveyed and no cultural finds were made. Construction company personnel removed the rock piles.

Surveys
One reroute, 20 I/E routes to the ROW, 21 additional work spaces (AWs) and I/E routes to the work
spaces, and five rock pile areas (consisting of 30 rock piles/water bars) outside the ROW were surveyed.
Thirty-seven of the I/E and AW surveyed areas were approved for use and four were denied, and the reroute
was approved.
Minor Reroute
The Nickel Creek reroute survey was requested by the construction company (see Figure 2 and
Appendix A). One IO (TX-HIO3) was encountered during the survey, and the reroute was approved.
Ingress/Egress Routes
Twenty I/E routes to the ROW were requested by the construction company (Table 5). Generally the
I/E routes ran from major, in-use roads to the ROW; however, two of the routes ran from the ROW and back
to the ROW, one around an irrigation ditch and one around an irrigated field. Eighteen of the routes were
approved for use and two were denied. Both of the denied routes crossed cultural sites.

Additional Work Spaces
Twenty-one areas of additional work space were surveyed. Four locations were quarry pits or piles
of previously quarried material necessary for filling in arroyos that formed on the ROW after initial
15

construction and for construction of water bars to prevent erosion on the ROW. Two locations were disposal
areas for large rocks removed from the ROW, and two areas were I/E routes, one to the rock disposal area
and one to a gravel pile. One area was for additional easement when the bore head came up outside the
ROW. Eleven areas were adjacent to the ROW and necessary for constructing in difficult terrain, parking,
turning trucks around, or for bore rigs. Nineteen AWs were approved for use and two were denied.
Rock Piles/Water Bars Outside the ROW
Twenty-seven water bars constructed of rock extended outside the ROW, and three piles of rock
were stacked outside the ROW (see Figure 2, Appendix A, and Table 4). The rock piles/water bars were
within five areas that were surveyed, and no cultural finds were made.
Monitoring and Temporary Fencing
In Texas, roughly 8,169 m of construction were monitored in Guadalupe Mountains National Park,
the Salt Flat Dunes ACC, and at the base of the Delaware Escarpment. Monitoring included 2,869 m of site
areas and 5,300 m of nonsite areas. Thirteen sites were monitored during construction, and three sites were
temporarily fenced. Site 41CU651 (a section of the Butterfield Trail) was originally slated only for
temporary fencing rather than monitoring during construction. Because the site was located on GMNP
property, however, initial construction blading of the ROW through the site was also monitored. Site
41CU647 had a sediment fence placed along the eastern edge of the ROW where the ROW traversed the side
of a hill. The fence was placed to prevent dirt from rolling off the ROW during the leveling process. A
portion of 41CU648 was fenced where I/E route TX-83B crossed the site. The route was a narrow bladed
road and the fence was used to help prevent vehicle traffic from straying off the route and onto the site.
The Salt Flat Dunes ACC was located east of Salt Flat Playa in a setting of extensive coppice dunes
and sand sheet deposits (see Figure 2 and Appendix A). The ACC had been established because the site
density was high and the setting had created good potential for subsurface cultural deposits that lacked
surface manifestations. Although the ROW through the ACC had been cleared for construction and was not
recommended for construction monitoring, AT&T requested that a cultural monitor be present during
postconstruction cleanup to make sure that the construction company stayed within the ROW. The ACC was
roughly 4.0 km long and contained five sites (Table 6). Because the ROW was cleared for construction
without additional work and the construction company stayed within the ROW, these sites are not described
again here; see Jones (2009) for site descriptions.
Monitoring took place in both site and nonsite areas of the ACC. It resulted in no discoveries or
construction incidents.

Discoveries
As a result of survey and monitoring, additional features were discovered on two sites (Table 7), 17
IOs were documented, and one new site was noted on I/E route TX-88B. Use of the route was denied and
there was no impact to the site. The site was not recorded, however, because of private landowner issues.

Site Summaries
Thirteen sites were monitored during construction. Eight sites are described below, and the site
forms were updated. Because sites 41CU648 and 41CU748 had additional features, the site boundaries were
expanded. Five sites not originally slated for monitoring were monitored to keep the construction company
within the ROW.

Site Description: Site 41CU646 was a multicomponent Archaic and Formative/Late Prehistoric camp and
roasting locale with a historic trash scatter and features. The site was originally recorded by Archaeological
Services by Laura Michalik (ASLM) (Martin 2000). The site form was updated by WCRM during the
resurvey portion of the AT&T NexGen/Core Project (Kearns et al. 2003). Portions of the site were
excavated and the following description was summarized from Jones (2009), the treatment report for the
AT&T NexGen/Core Project. The site measured 200 x 170 m (656 x 558 ft) and was located on the
southeast-facing pediment of the Guadalupe Mountains (see Figure 2). It was on a bench bounded on the
east, north, and west by the narrow Smith Canyon, which supported a riparian mixed floral assemblage. The
9.3 m (30.5 ft) wide northeast/southwest-trending ROW bisected the western one-third of the site for 195 m
(640 ft).
Twenty-seven features were identified on the site, including 22 prehistoric thermal features, two
historic road segments, one prospect pit, and two historic trash concentrations (Figure 5). Prehistoric
artifacts from the surface outside the ROW included 115 flakes, two projectile point bases, and one complete
Scallorn point. Only two pieces of ground stone (both metates) were noted, and there were no ceramics.
Four of the prehistoric features (11, 11.1, 13, and 20) were previously investigated (Jones 2009).
Spatial analysis of the surface artifacts and feature locations resulted in the identification of four prehistoric
study units including one camp locale, two camp and roasting locales, and the general site area (GSA). Site
stratigraphy was also identified, and the historic component was investigated.
Surface collection from the ROW resulted in the recovery of 2,445 lithic artifacts (2,261 pieces of
debitage and 184 tools) and 59 historic artifacts. One long bone fragment 2 cm long that was from a dog- or
deer-sized mammal was also recovered.
Subsurface investigations revealed four strata. The strata consisted of loose, unconsolidated
sediment over a series of increasingly consolidated, silty clay loam strata with calcium carbonate flecks and
inclusions increasing with depth. Cultural material was found mainly in the upper 20 cm of the sediment
profile (i.e., in Strata I and II). Artifacts on the surface and in Stratum I were considered to be in secondary
context as a result of the mechanical disturbance. Stratum II artifacts appeared not to be mechanically
disturbed but to have suffered from some bioturbation. The numerous artifacts present in the first level of
Stratum III were probably the result of natural mixing at the contact of Strata II and III and the few artifacts
found in the lower levels of Stratum III and in Stratum IV appeared to be the result of bioturbation.
The Camp Locale measured 36 x 9.3 m (see Figure 5). Only lithic artifacts were recovered. Surface
collection and Stratum I produced 476 pieces of debitage and 34 tools. Fifty-three pieces of debitage and no
tools were recovered from Stratum II. Debitage and tools indicate that core reduction, tool manufacture and
maintenance, cutting, scraping, and graving took place within the activity area. The four complete and 10
fragmented projectile points indicated hunting and hunting equipment maintenance activities. Projectile
points included one Early to Middle Archaic point, three Middle Archaic points, five Late Prehistoric points,
and five indeterminate points. The presence of both Middle Archaic and Late Prehistoric projectile points
probably indicated occupation during both of these time periods. Although, no hearths were found in the
ROW, the wide range of activities represented by the artifacts indicated that the area was probably a camp
locale.
Camp and Roasting Locale 1 was 36 x 13.5 m and defined by a lithic artifact scatter and Feature 20
(see Figure 5). Lithic artifacts were found on the surface, in Strata I and II, and in the top of Stratum III.
Feature 20 was a 7.3 x 6.3 m surface stain and a sparse scatter of burned rock and flaked lithic artifacts.
Only 25 percent of the feature was within the ROW. The large size of Feature 20 indicated that it was
probably either a burned rock discard pile or the deflated remains of several roasting pits in proximity to each
other. Artifacts from the activity area included 417 pieces of debitage and 34 tools, including eight projectile
points, from the combined modern ground surface and Stratum I. There were 16 pieces of debitage
recovered from Stratum II and six pieces of debitage from the top of Stratum III. Debitage and tools

indicated that tool manufacture and maintenance, scraping, and cutting were taking place. The eight
projectile point bases indicated the repair of hunting equipment and hunting activities. Dating of Camp and
Roasting Locale 1 was difficult and was based on projectile point types. Four of the projectile points were
temporally indeterminate, one appeared to range from Early to Middle Archaic, one was probably from either
the Middle or the Late Archaic, and two were Late Archaic in style. The points indicated both Middle and
Late Archaic occupations of the locale. The diversity of activities and the burned rock scatter (Feature 20)
indicated that the study unit served as a camp and roasting locale.
Camp and Roasting Locale 2 measured 64 x 24 m and contained Features 11, 11.1, and 13 (see
Figure 5). It was defined by the extent of the features and lithic artifacts. Surface artifacts from the activity
area included 1,204 pieces of debitage and 94 tools. Lithic artifacts from the 14 nonfeature units included
1,041 pieces of debitage and 15 tools, including six projectile points. The artifacts were generally found in
Strata I and II, and in the top of Stratum III. Although debitage counts varied between the stratigraphic
proveniences, percentages of debitage type and material type were fairly consistent in the three strata.
Feature 11 was a large burned rock ring midden (15.6 x 14.8 x 0.73 m). The rock was generally
rounded limestone, although tabular sandstone was also present in the ring. There were 1,911 pieces of
debitage, 33 tools, 13 fragments of eggshell from a medium-sized bird, and three tooth enamel fragments;
two were artiodactyl (one charred), and the other was identifiable only as a dog- to deer-sized mammal.
Macrobotanical analysis produced woody legume, oak, pine, buckthorn, juniper or pine, and indeterminate
wood. The samples indicated that all of species were probably used as fuel wood. Feature 11.1 was the
central roasting pit of Feature 11, and only half of it was exposed. The feature measured 1.29 x 0.55 x 0.22
m, and the fill contained 20 pieces of burned rock and one piece of debitage. A flotation sample from
beneath the rocks yielded oak and indeterminate wood fragments; both were probably used as fuel wood.
Radiocarbon dates from Feature 11 and 11.1 indicated that the ring midden was used intermittently between
A.D. 140 and 630, and some activities may have taken place on top of the partially filled ring midden around
A.D. 1440. Investigation indicated that the location of the central roasting pit probably remained constant,
with the inner portion of the ring being maintained space. Analysis of the quantity of burned rock and
feature size indicated approximately 580 episodes of use of Feature 11 and 11.1.
Feature 13 was a large burned rock midden, of which approximately 25 percent was in the ROW.
Overall, the feature was probably oval and measured 2.8 x 6.4 m x 0.27 m tall. It consisted of a mass of
burned limestone and quartzite cobbles that ranged from 1 to 12 cm. One hundred twenty-four lithic artifacts
were recovered, including 120 pieces of debitage and four tools.
Artifacts recovered from Camp and Roasting Locale 2 included 4,277 pieces of debitage and 146
tools; 26 projectile points were recovered. Twenty-two of the points were incomplete and two of the four
complete points were reworked. Debitage from Camp and Roasting Locale 2 indicated that tool production
and maintenance were taking place, including the production of bifaces. Broken and reworked projectile
points also indicated that hunting and the retooling of hunting equipment were conducted. The other tools
indicated that scraping and cutting/chopping occurred.
The chronology of Camp and Roasting Locale 2 was based on both radiocarbon dating and the
presences of projectile points. The 26 projectile points included one Middle Archaic, eight Late Archaic, two
Late Archaic/Early Formative, eight Formative/Late Prehistoric, and seven indeterminate. All of the
radiocarbon dates came from Features 11 and 11.1. The dates indicated that Camp and Roasting Locale 2
was repeatedly occupied between A.D. 140 and 630, the transitional period from the Late Archaic (Hueco
phase) to the early Formative (Mesilla phase); some activities may have taken place on top of the partially
filled ring midden between A.D. 1410 and 1480 (late El Paso or Ochoa phase).
The GSA was defined in the ROW as the area of the site outside the other established study units
(see Figure 5). The area was investigated with 38 (4 x 4.65 m) surface collection units and two subsurface 1
x 1 m units. Surface collection resulted in the recovery of 193 lithic artifacts, including 179 pieces of
20

debitage and 14 tools. Forty-four pieces of debitage were recovered from the subsurface units; however, no
tools were found. Prehistoric artifact types from the GSA were similar to the types from the three activity
areas and occurred in similar percentages, although in much smaller quantities.
Within the ROW, a sparse scatter of 85 historic artifacts was recovered. Historic artifacts included
items of ceramic, glass, metal, Bakelite, and paper. The trash appeared to be a combination of domestic,
ranch, and automobile-related items. The full date range of the trash was 1890-1959, but it probably dated to
the late 1930s and 1940s. Outside the ROW were two road segments, one prospect pit, and two historic trash
concentrations (Kearns et al. 2003). The trash concentrations probably dated ca. 1925, and the road
segments were probably historic in age and used as access to the dumping areas. The age of the prospect pit
was indeterminate. The trash in the ROW was in disturbed context; however, some of it may have been
associated with the trash dumps that probably dated to the 1920s. Much of the trash in the ROW appeared to
date from the 1930s to the 1940s and was probably associated with additional trash dumping episodes, the
prospect pit, or construction of the AT&T cable in the late 1940s.
Lithic artifacts numbering 5,796 were recovered from the ROW and excavated portion of the site
outside the ROW. These included 5,554 pieces of debitage and 242 flaked stone tools. Debitage from
41CU646 was indicative of tool manufacture and maintenance. Eighty-four percent of the projectile points
were incomplete, indicating that retooling of hunting equipment was also taking place. Other lithic tools
indicated that cutting and scraping were common activities and that chopping and graving were also taking
place. Material types in all proveniences were dominated by chert (generally around 70 percent), followed
by limestone (generally around 15 percent). Combined counts of quartzite, mudstone, siltstone, sandstone,
and obsidian combined, made up less than 15 percent of the material types. All of the lithic material types
were locally available except for obsidian. The obsidian came from Mule Creek on the ArizonaâNew
Mexico border, which indicated trade with groups to the west.
Five faunal specimens and six pieces of shell were recovered from the site. Faunal specimens
included one specimen (13 fragments) of chicken-sized bird eggshell, one long bone fragment from a dog- to
deer-sized mammal, and three tooth enamel fragments, two of which were artiodactyls (one charred), and the
other was identifiable only as dog- to deer-sized mammal. The eggshell and enamel fragments were
recovered from mixed contexts; consequently, their association with the prehistoric use of Feature 11 was
unclear, although the charring of the artiodactyl enamel fragment probably indicated a prehistoric affiliation.
The long bone fragment was from the surface. The six pieces of shell included three fragments of
unmodified pond snail, a hinge fragment from a freshwater bivalve, and two unidentifiable fragments. The
three fragments of pond snail were too small and fragile to measure but were probably Stagnicola sp., which
reflected a moist environment. The hinge fragment was most likely from a Tampico pearlymussel shell
(Cyrtonaias tampicoensis), which occurs from northeastern Mexico into central Texas (Howells 1996:1),
including the Pecos River Basin (Lang and Mehlhop 1996).
Eight flotation samples and 11 macrobotanical and flotation samples were analyzed from the ring
midden (Feature 11), the central roasting pit (Feature 11.1), and a burned rock concentration (Feature 13).
The two samples from Feature 13 contained no botanical remains. Macrobotanical samples from Features 11
and 11.1 contained oak, pine, woody legume, pine/juniper, buckthorn, and an indeterminate wood. The
sample probably represents fuel. Edible plant remains were not identified.
Chronological data for 41CU646 came from both projectile points and radiocarbon dating. Fifty
projectile points were recovered from the site. Temporally, the points included two possibly Early/Middle
Archaic, four Middle Archaic, one Middle/Late Archaic, 10 Late Archaic, four Late Archaic/Formative, and
13 Formative/Late Prehistoric. Sixteen points were indeterminate. All but two points came from mixed
context, and some of the points may have been curated items. Four radiocarbon samples from Features 11
and 11.1 indicated that at least one portion of the site was repeatedly occupied between A.D. 140 and 1480
(Table 8). Projectile points indicated occupation during the period between the Early/Middle Archaic and

21

the Formative/Late Prehistoric. The radiocarbon dates confirm the middle and end part of the sequence
between the end of the Late Archaic and the Formative/Late Prehistoric.

Site 41CU646 appeared to be repeatedly occupied between the Early/Middle Archaic and the late
Formative/Late Prehistoric (Table 9). The location of the site on a bench above the well-watered Smith
Canyon and Choza Spring was an ideal setting for both gathering and hunting. The general lack of ground
stone (none was recovered from the ROW and only two pieces, both metates, were noted outside the ROW)
indicated that seed processing was not a common activity, and although the area was utilized during the
Formative/Late Prehistoric period there was a noticeable lack of ceramics. Numerous roasting features
indicated that succulent cooking was probably taking place.

The Early and Middle Archaic periods were represented by six projectile points. Two of the points
dated to the transition from the Early to Middle Archaic; both were reworked. Four points dated to the
Middle Archaic; three were broken and one was complete. The broken points indicated tool maintenance,
and the points in general indicate big game hunting. One burned rock concentration (Feature 20) and one
Tampico pearlymussel shell fragment were located in mixed Middle and Late Archaic context. Although the
feature and shell fragment may be associated with the Middle Archaic points, the association was not
definitive.
The Late Archaic component was represented by Feature 11 (burned rock ring midden), possibly
Feature 20 (burned rock concentration), and 11 projectile points. Two Late Archaic dates were obtained
from Feature 11; both ranged from cal A.D. 140 to 380. As mentioned above, Feature 20 (burned rock
concentration) and one Tampico pearlymussel shell fragment were located in a mixed Middle and Late
Archaic context and cannot definitively be associated with either. The burned rock indicated that succulents
were probably being processed, which was usually done in the winter or spring. One of the points spanned
the Middle to Late Archaic period and 10 dated solely to the Late Archaic. The points indicated that hunting
was taking place in the vicinity during the period. Nine of the points were broken and two were reworked,
inferring that tool maintenance was taking place as well.
The Late Archaic/early Formative component contained a burned rock ring midden (Feature 11),
central roasting pit (Feature 11.1), and four projectile points. Three radiocarbon dates between A.D. 140 and
630 were obtained from the features. Two of the four projectile points were broken. Data from the ring
midden indicated that succulents were probably being processed, which was usually done in the winter or
spring. The projectile points indicated that hunting tool maintenance and large game hunting activities were
taking place.
The late Formative/Late Prehistoric period was represented by a burned rock ring midden (Feature
11) and 13 projectile points. One radiocarbon date from the postabandonment fill of the ring midden dated to
A.D. 1410-1480. Twelve of the 13 Formative/Late Prehistoric points were broken. Data from the ring
midden indicated that succulents were probably being processed, and that the site was used in the winter or
spring. The projectile points indicated that hunting tool maintenance and large game hunting activities were
taking place.
In addition to the points and radiocarbon-dated burned rock features, also recovered were Mule
Creek obsidian, Tampico pearlymussel shell, and dog- or deer-sized tooth remains. These items were from
mixed contexts and could not be isolated temporally. The faunal remains were possible evidence of reliance
on big game. Mule Creek obsidian indicated contact with groups farther west along the New Mexicoâ
Arizona border; the nearest source of Tampico pearlymussel was the Pecos River to the east. Based on
similar percentages of lithic material types and tool types from all of the contexts, it can be inferred that
similar activities were probably taking place during all of the temporal components from the Middle Archaic
through the Formative/Late Prehistoric. Activities included succulent roasting, hunting, tool production and
maintenance (including hunting equipment), cutting, scraping, and graving.
The historic component consisted of a general scatter of trash, two dumped trash concentrations, two
road segments, and a prospect pit. The trash appeared to be a combination of domestic, ranch, and
automobile-related items dumped in the 1920s and late 1930s-early 1940s.
Treatment Recommendations: The ROW traversed the site northeast/southwest for 195 m. Investigations
at 41CU646 had cleared the site for construction; however, at the request of LSI and GMNP personnel, all
earth-disturbing activities and heavy equipment crossings of the site were monitored. Pickups and backhoes
were allowed to cross the site without a monitor. Also, the construction company requested a 75 x 40 ft area
of additional work space (AW-5) for a bore rig at Choza Creek (see Figure 2 and Appendix A).

23

Treatment Results: Survey of AW-5 revealed one limestone flake and two pieces of burned rock, and the
area was approved for construction use by GMNP. Construction within the ROW was completed without
incident.
Condition: Although the portion of the site within the ROW has been impacted by construction, the portion
of the site outside the ROW is in good condition.
Significance and National Register Eligibility: Site 41CU646 was previously determined eligible for the
NRHP under criterion (d) (P. Smith to C. Wheeler, fax transmission, 2 October 2001, BLM, Las Cruces,
New Mexico). Burned rock features observed outside the ROW retain the potential to provide significant
information regarding roasting locales and/or open camps in the Trans-Pecos region. Specifically, these
features might provide information regarding targeted subsistence resources and could provide better
understanding of the range of activities that occurred at such sites. Therefore, archaeological research
potential has not been exhausted, and it is recommended that the site remain eligible for the NRHP under
criterion (d).
Site Number: 41CU667
Temporary Number: Field 2046
Cultural/Temporal Affiliation: Prehistoric/unknown
Site Type: Lithic procurement locale
Site Description: Site 41CU667 was a lithic procurement locale of unknown prehistoric affiliation. The site
was first recorded by WCRM during the resurvey for the AT&T NexGen/Core Project (Kearns et al. 2003).
The site was investigated during the treatment phase of the project, and the following description was
summarized from Jones (2009), the treatment report for the AT&T NexGen/Core Project. The 100 x 65 m
site was located in Guadalupe Mountains National Park on the dissected pediment along the southeastern
flank of the Guadalupe Mountains (see Figure 2 and Appendix A; Figure 6). It was situated on the top and
northeastern side of a rolling, rocky ridge south of Smith Canyon, approximately 0.6 km (0.4 mi) east of
Choza Spring and 1 km (0.6 mi) southeast of Nipple Hill. The terrain contained abundant limestone clasts in
a silt loam matrix. A bedrock outcrop of Permian age Cherry Canyon Formation limestone formed a low rise
on the ridge crest, which served as the source material for the lithic procurement locale. Vegetation on the
site was juniper, gray oak, mountain mahogany, soaptree yucca, Apache plume, barberry, cholla, prickly
pear, and miscellaneous grasses and annuals. Sotol and agave occurred in the vicinity. Site 41CU646, a
multicomponent historic refuse scatter and prehistoric camp and roasting locale, was approximately 40 m
(131 ft) northeast of 41CU667.
Investigations at 41CU667 included in-field analysis of 67 lithic artifacts from outside the project
ROW, and collection of 114 lithic artifacts from the surface of the ROW. The site contained four areas of
higher artifact density (Loci 1-4) within a general scatter of debitage and cores. Delineation of the loci was
approximate and was affected by vegetative cover. Other loci may have been obscured by vegetation.
Locus 1 had the highest artifact density. It was an asymmetrical area that measured 23 x 20 m, was
located in the southwestern quadrant of the site, and was directly associated with the outcrop of cherty
limestone along the ridge crest (see Figure 6). Approximately 50 m2 of Locus 1 were within the ROW, and
the remainder of the locus was south of the ROW. Locus 1 contained two areas where artifacts were
clustered in spatially discrete concentrations.

Locus 2 was a roughly triangular area that measured 15 x 10 m; it was located on top of the ridge
immediately south of the ROW and approximately 1 to 5 m east of Locus 1 (see Figure 6). Locus 2 was a
moderately dense artifact concentration adjacent to the cherty limestone outcrop.
Locus 3 was immediately north of the ROW approximately 5 m north of Locus 1 (see Figure 6).
This irregularly shaped 20 x 15 m locus was on the top and upper, north-facing slope of the ridge and
contained a moderately dense lithic artifact scatter.
Locus 4 was another irregularly shaped, moderately dense lithic artifact scatter that encompassed an
area roughly 25 x 10 m. It was located along the southern edge of the ROW on the eastern slope of the ridge
(see Figure 6). Approximately 30 m2 of Locus 4 were within the ROW. Locus 4 contained three relatively
discrete concentrations.
In addition to the four loci, a light scatter of cherty limestone and limestone artifacts was present
across the site. With few exceptions, artifacts represented exploitation of the local tool stone. One small,
discrete artifact concentration was present in the ROW outside the loci boundaries.
A sample of 67 lithic artifacts from outside the ROW was mapped and analyzed in the field. Most of
the artifacts (70.1 percent) were in Locus 1, with smaller proportions in Locus 2 (7.5 percent), Locus 3 (16.4
percent), Locus 4 (3.0 percent), and in the general site scatter (3.0 percent). Seventeen of the analyzed
artifacts were cores or tools. These included 10 multidirectional cores, one unidirectional core, one small
chopper/scraper, one retouched flake, one fragmented retouched flake or early stage biface, and three
possible hammerstones. No temporally or culturally diagnostic artifacts were noted. One of the cores was
chert, and one of the retouched items was quartzite. All of the other flakes and tools were manufactured
from the locally available, dark gray, cherty limestone or gray limestone. Typically, the cherty limestone
artifacts were physically weathered and oxidized to a reddish or tan color. The three possible hammerstones
had been produced from subangular limestone cobbles that were locally available in the surface detritus.
This material was not cherty and was typically softer than the material of the other artifacts. Although
classified in the field as hammerstones, identification was based largely on morphology and was unclear
because of the weathered surfaces.
One hundred fourteen artifacts were recovered from the site surface within the ROW. These
included 108 pieces of debitage and six cores. Except for density, there were no distinctive differences in the
distribution of artifact types among the loci. The collected assemblage includes seven primary, 62
secondary, and 39 tertiary flakes in proportions that are consistent with identification of the site as a lithic
procurement locale. Six cores were collected and included three unidirectional, one bifacial, one
multidirectional, and one indeterminate form. None of the cores appears to be patterned or purposely
designed. The multidirectional core was indicative of opportunistic reduction incorporating bifacial flake
removal on opposite edges. The relatively high incidence of flake debris vs. cores and other flaked
implements indicates that the initial reduction of cores and core tools for use elsewhere was a primary
activity.
The predominant lithic material type on the site is fine-grained, but not cryptocrystalline, cherty
limestone. All of the artifacts recovered from the site exhibit some physical or chemical alteration to the
flaked surfaces, a finding that largely coincided with in-field analysis. In some instances, weathering is
severe, and flake scars and other artifact attributes are softened or obscured. In these cases, the flaked
surface resembles a coarse-grained crust. Because of weathering, use wear is not evident on the artifacts.
Also, identification of primary, secondary, and tertiary flakes is difficult because of severe weathering on the
dorsal surfaces of many flakes. Weathering, in a number of instances, obscures the difference between flake
scars and unmodified cortex.
Treatment Recommendations: The ROW crossed the site northeast/southwest for 98 m. Personnel from
GMNP required monitoring of all earth-disturbing activities and heavy equipment crossings of the site.
26

Backhoes and pickups could cross without a monitor. During construction in the 1940s and 1980s, several
large boulders had been placed across the ROW and directly outside the ROW. Initially, the construction
company requested to stack the rocks in the ROW on top of the rocks outside the ROW. GMNP personnel
agreed, with the stipulation that a monitor be present. Ultimately, it was decided to remove the rock from
outside the ROW off the site.
Treatment Results: All of the rock moving was monitored and completed without the construction
equipment leaving the ROW. Construction within the ROW was completed without incident and there were
no cultural discoveries.
Condition: The condition of the site outside the ROW was good.
Significance and National Register Eligibility: Site 41CU667 was previously determined eligible for the
NRHP under criterion (d) (P. Smith to C. Wheeler, fax transmission, 2 October 2001, BLM, Las Cruces,
New Mexico). Current investigations indicate that the portion of the site within the ROW has been heavily
impacted by construction of the AT&T A and B cables. Although the distribution of cultural material within
the ROW has been compromised by previous disturbance, the densest concentrations of artifacts in the ROW
correspond to the locations of Locus 1 and Locus 4 and may indicate that the artifacts were not significantly
displaced. The artifact assemblage from the ROW provided a sufficient sample to address current research
concerns. As demonstrated, significant cultural material is present outside the ROW. Therefore,
archaeological research potential has not been exhausted, and it is recommended that the site remain eligible
for the NRHP under criterion (d).
Site Number: 41CU651âLocus 3
Temporary Number: BFT
Cultural/Temporal Affiliation: Historic/Early Statehood period
Site Type: Butterfield Trail
Site Description: Site 41CU651 was located in the vicinity of Guadalupe Pass and consisted of three
segments (Loci 1, 2, and 3) of the Southern Route of the Butterfield Overland Mail (Butterfield Trail). Only
Locus 3 was impacted during the current undertaking. Locus 3 was identified during the resurvey of the
AT&T NexGen/Core Project (Kearns et al. 2003). The locus was investigated during the treatment phase of
the project, and the following description was summarized from Jones (2009), the treatment report for the
AT&T NexGen/Core Project. Locus 3 was discovered because of presence of The Pinery (41CU193), a
stage stop that was listed on the NRHP in 1974. The station was located near Pine Springs in GMNP near
the AT&T ROW (see Figure 2 and Appendix A; Figure 7). Locus 3 was discovered a few hundred yards east
of the station, beyond and to the east of the GMNP housing area. Vegetation in the area was predominantly
creosote bush, snakeweed, several yucca species, and various range grasses.
The main portion of the trail extended eastward from the ROW on the high ground between
Cottonwood and Cherry canyons toward Independence Spring, an important water stop on the Butterfield
Trail. This seemed to be the easiest, most expeditious route from Independence Spring to The Pinery. The
two-track road on this route measured approximately 8 to 10 ft and exhibited no evidence of blading or
surface preparation. The route west of the ROW had been obliterated during construction of housing and
maintenance areas for GMNP (Figure 8).

Figure 8. View of 41CU651 to the west-northwest along Locus 3. A portion of the
trail extends across the AT&T ROW and toward the GMNP housing area in the
direction of The Pinery (not visible). El Capitan is in the left background.
Treatment Recommendations: The ROW crossed the site northeast/southwest for 10 ft. In addition,
GMNP personnel requested that the AT&T ROW be temporarily fenced for 100 ft from each side of the trail.
Initially, GMNP personnel required monitoring of all earth-disturbing activities and crossings of the site by
heavy equipment. Backhoes and pickups could cross without a monitor. After the initial construction
blading, GMNP personnel agreed that further monitoring was unnecessary.
Treatment Results: The site was temporarily fenced for the duration of construction. Initial construction
blading of the ROW was monitored. No cultural material was encountered, and construction was completed
without incident.
Condition: The portion of 41CU651âLocus 3 in the vicinity of the AT&T ROW was in poor condition in
the ROW. East of the ROW, the route was in good condition; west of the ROW (in the direction of The
Pinery) the route had generally been obliterated by construction.
Significance and National Register Eligibility: Site 41CU651 was previously determined eligible for the
NRHP under criterion (d) (P. Smith to C. Wheeler, fax transmission, 2 October 2001, BLM, Las Cruces,
New Mexico). Only a small portion was documented during the current project; therefore, research potential
has not been exhausted, and it is recommended that the site remain eligible for the NRHP under criterion (d).

Site Number: 41CU647
Temporary Number: Field 2086 (Matt 3)
Cultural/Temporal Affiliation: Prehistoric/unknown; Historic/late Middle Statehood to Modern period
Site Type: Prehistoric camp and roasting locale; historic transportation corridor
Site Description: Site 41CU647 was a short-term, open prehistoric camp with a historic road and associated
fence line that transect the site in a west/northwest to east/southeast direction. The site was first recorded by
WCRM during the resurvey for the AT&T NexGen/Core Project, and the following description was
summarized from the initial survey report (Kearns et al. 2003). The site was located in the foothills of the
Guadalupe Mountains (see Figure 2 and Appendix A). The Delaware Mountains, Capitan Peak, and
Guadalupe Peak were visible to the west-northwest. The site was situated on a small saddle between two low
hills to the east and west. The site continued upslope, along a gradual, north-trending slope, which merged
into a relatively narrow basin. Site 41CU647 was approximately 60 m north of an unnamed intermittent
drainage. Sediment was gravelly silt loam. The floral community was transitional, with upland desert
species alongside species that dominated the lower elevations. Flora consisted of a mix of small junipers,
mesquite, cane cholla, allthorn, sumac, banana yucca, beargrass, faxon yucca, Torrey's yucca, purple prickly
pear, agave, and small cylindrical cacti. To the north, within the narrow valley, various species of grasses
dominated the floral community, along with sumac, mesquite, and cane cholla.
The prehistoric component of 41CU647 was a large scatter of burned limestone with a relatively
meager scatter of chipped stone debitage and two thermal features (Figure 9). The site measured
approximately 130 x 30 m. Hundreds of pieces of burned limestone are diffusely scattered throughout the
site. Limestone was also the prevalent material type for the chipped stone. Other material types included
green volcanic tuff, quartzite, and chert. Chipped stone tools were expedient forms that included two small
ovate scrapers and a large, limestone retouched tertiary flake that appeared to have served as a cutting tool.
Feature 1 was a 4 x 4 m concentration of burned limestone in the southern portion of the site. The
concentration appeared to be a deflated thermal feature. The concentration consisted of roughly 100 pieces
of limestone that ranged from 5-10 cm in diameter. No artifacts or carbon stains were observed within the
concentration. The area was highly deflated by alluvial erosion.
Feature 2 was a 1.0 m diameter hearth. The feature was partially deflated and consisted of
approximately 50 pieces of burned limestone that averaged 10 cm in diameter. Feature 2 was located
approximately 15 m west of the ROW. Carbon-stained sediment was visible in the feature fill. Two
limestone flakes, one primary and one tertiary, were associated with the feature. Numerous pieces of burned
limestone have been displaced and washed downslope in a small gully.
The historic component consisted of an abandoned dirt road and a barbed wire fence that paralleled
the road. This component transected the northern edge of the site. The width of the road was 5 to 7 m, and
the fence was located approximately 23 ft (7 m) south of the road. The barbed wire was identified as a
possible Baker's Barb, Needle-point Variation. The original patent (number 273219) for this barbed wire
was February 27, 1883. The road and fence line continued an unknown distance.
Feature 3 was a possibly historic hearth located within southern portion of the AT&T ROW,
approximately 5 m northwest of Station Pole 2086. The circular hearth was approximately 2.5 ft (0.75 m) in
diameter, with stones arranged around the outside perimeter of the circle. The stones were only slightly
burned. Two large cans of indeterminate type were encountered near the hearth. Both were 8 inches in
diameter. One can read ESTAB 22, and the other read UZ&T.

The prehistoric component of 41CU647 appeared to be a short-term, limited activity locale. The site
was located in a unique ecosystem that currently supports a variety of cactus species. The floral variety
suggests that the site may have served as a seasonal harvesting station. The prehistoric component lacked
temporally diagnostic artifacts and can only be assigned to an unknown prehistoric affiliation. The lack of
ceramics at this site, however, could indicate a preceramic temporal affiliation. The Baker's Barb, NeedleÂ­
point Variation wire associated with the historic component of the site suggested a date ranging from the
latter part of the Middle Statehood period to the Modern period (ca. 1883-1950).
Treatment Recommendations: The AT&T ROW crossed the site north/south for 128 m. The original
treatment recommendation for the site was to monitor all earth-disturbing activities and heavy equipment
crossings during construction. Backhoes and pickups were allowed to cross without a monitor. A temporary
sediment fence was placed along the western edge of the ROW where the ROW cut along the slope of a hill.
The fence was used to prevent sediment from rolling downslope and into the ROW. Erection of the fence
and initial blading through the site were monitored. Subsequent monitoring of construction was deemed
unnecessary.
Treatment Results: No cultural remains were encountered. Construction was completed without incident.
Condition: The site was in poor condition. Alluvial deflation was evident; numerous gullies and shallow
washes truncate the site from a rocky slope adjacent to and southwest of the site. Other impacts included
previous construction in the AT&T ROW and what appears to be minimal traffic by local ranch workers
along the ROW.
Significance and National Register Eligibility: Carbon-stained sediment associated with Feature 2 (outside
the ROW) indicated that portions of the site retained integrity and could provide chronometric data and
information regarding prehistoric land use and subsistence practices. The tool assemblage could address
technological research domains. The abandoned road and historic fence line could address issues that pertain
to early transportation and ranching. Site 41CU647 was previously recommended eligible for the NRHP
under criteria (a) and (d) (Kearns et al. 2003), and a similar recommendation is maintained.
Site Number: 41CU648
Temporary Number: Field 2106 (Richard A)
Cultural/Temporal Affiliation: Prehistoric/unknown
Site Type: Open camp and roasting locale
Site Description: Site 41CU648 was a large, repeatedly used prehistoric camp/habitation and roasting
locale. The site was first recorded by WCRM during the resurvey for the AT&T NexGen/Core Project and
was updated during an ancillary survey (Kearns et al. 2003; Proper 2005). The site had not changed from
one recording to the next. The following description was summarized from the initial survey report for the
project (Kearns et al. 2003). It was located in Guadalupe Canyon below the western flank of the Delaware
Mountains along a gentle west-southwest-facing slope (see Figure 2 and Appendix A). The site was bounded
on the northern and southern sides by unnamed intermittent drainages that eventually empty into Guadalupe
Arroyo (Figure 10). The site was 500 x 215 m and situated around a north/south-trending sandstone outcrop
which rises approximately 10 m above the surrounding terrain. The northern half of the site appeared to be
an undisturbed anthrosol (dark, cultural sediment) composed of dark sandy loam. The southern half of the
site appeared to be a deflated anthrosol, and in many areas, artifacts and burned rock were resting on
sandstone bedrock. Sporadic patches of recent eolian deposits were present. The site was in a desert scrub
community that supported a creosote bush-dominant floral assemblage along with occasional yucca and

prickly pear. The area adjacent to and upon the sandstone outcrop supports a distinctively different floral
community consisting of sumac, scrub oak, cane cholla, beargrass, saltbush, acacia, several species of yucca,
ephedra, and ocotillo, along with various grasses.
Natural impacts to the site included slope wash, channel-cut erosion, and bioturbation. Mechanical
impacts included the AT&T ROW and ROWs for Dell Telephone Cooperative, Chevron Petroleum, an
unnamed liquid petroleum gas line, and El Paso Natural Gas pipelines. Also, several bladed roads transect
the site.
During the original inventory, an area of approximately 160 x 47 m was documented. A 100 percent
sample of the debitage along the AT&T ROW was recorded. Material types include limestone, fine to
medium-grained chert with an array of colors, quartzite, and chalcedony. Limestone was the dominant
material type, followed by chert, quartzite, and chalcedony. Debitage exhibited all stages of reduction and
included miscellaneous flake fragments and shatter. Tertiary flakes (n = 21) were the dominant flake type,
followed by primary flakes (n = 6) and secondary flakes (n = 6). A lithic concentration (Concentration 1)
was encountered that consisted of high quality, fine-grained chert. All of the chipped stone tools were
expedient items, which included a variety of both unifacially and bifacially retouched flakes, a subtriangular
scraper, multifunctional core/hammerstones, core/choppers, and a crude, bidirectionally retouched, cobble
chopper tool. A unifacial slab metate fragment that had been pecked and smoothed was recorded. The
metate was associated with a large midden deposit. It was estimated that more than 1,000 pieces of burned
rock and more than 100 pieces of debitage were scattered diffusely throughout the site. Although no features
were encountered within the ROW, eight thermal features were recorded within 20 m of the ROW.
Feature 1 was a 7 x 5 m burned rock midden consisting of approximately 500 pieces of burned
limestone (80 percent) and sandstone (20 percent). The average size of the burned rock was 10 cm in
diameter. The midden was eroding from a west-southwestâtrending slope. It was adjacent to the bladed road
approximately 10 m southeast of the AT&T ROW. No carbon stains were visible; however, subsurface
investigations were not conducted. One rounded, multidirectional core/hammerstone of limestone was
associated with Feature 1.
Feature 2 was located approximately 10 m south of Feature 1. It was a 1 m diameter hearth with
approximately 50 pieces of fire-cracked limestone (90 percent) and sandstone (10 percent) that averaged 10
cm in diameter. No carbon stains were visible in the feature fill and no artifacts were associated. The
location of Feature 2 suggested that it was a hearth associated with Feature 1.
Feature 3 was a 2 x 1 m partially deflated hearth. It consisted of approximately 30-40 pieces of
burned sandstone (90 percent) and limestone (10 percent) that averaged 30 cm in diameter. The feature was
eroding from a southwest-trending slope, 16 m southeast of the ROW. No carbon stains were observed in
the feature. Feature 3 was adjacent to a northeast/southwest-trending two-track road that paralleled the
AT&T ROW.
Feature 4 was a 1.5 m diameter hearth that contained approximately 100 pieces of burned limestone
(85 percent) and sandstone (15 percent), ranging from 5 to 10 cm in diameter. No artifacts or carbon stains
were observed in the feature. The feature was 2 m southeast of the bladed road and 4 m north of Feature 1.
Feature 5 was a 7 x 2.5 m burned rock midden or roasting feature. It consisted of roughly 200 pieces
of burned limestone (60 percent) and sandstone (40 percent) that averaged 15 cm in diameter. The feature
was severely deflated and had no readily definable outline. Feature 5 was eroding from an east-trending
slope on a narrow bedrock terrace between two sandstone boulder outcrops, 22 m southeast of the AT&T
ROW. No carbon stains were visible. Artifacts associated with the feature included one piece of limestone
shatter that exhibited unifacial retouch along one lateral margin and one limestone multidirectional core that
had been produced from a tabular cobble.

34

Feature 6 was a 6 x 4.5 m burned rock midden adjacent to the northern side of the AT&T ROW. The
midden was resting on sandstone bedrock and was surrounded by large sandstone boulders on the northern
and western sides. These boulders may have served as wind or heat deflectors. The midden consisted of
approximately 1,000 pieces of burned limestone (99 percent) and sandstone (1 percent) that ranged from 5 to
10 cm in diameter. Artifacts associated with the feature included a tabular limestone cobble with bifacial
retouch along one lateral margin (possibly a cutting tool), a limestone exhausted multidirectional core, a
limestone Stage II oval biface, a limestone tertiary flake, a piece of limestone shatter, and a limestone cobble
with unifacial retouch along one lateral margin. Faint carbon stains were observed within portions of the
feature fill.
Feature 7 was a 10 x 6 m deflated and disturbed burned rock concentration. The feature was located
adjacent to the AT&T ROW; a small gully borders the western margin. The feature was on bedrock on a
south-southwestâtrending slope and was bordered on the north and east by sandstone boulders. No carbon
stains were observed. The concentration contained more than 2,000 pieces of burned limestone (95 percent)
and sandstone (5 percent) that were poorly sorted and ranged up to 50 cm in diameter. Artifacts associated
with this feature included a sandstone unifacial slab metate fragment, a piece of orthoquartzite shatter, a
limestone primary flake, a limestone tertiary flake with retouch along one lateral margin (possible cutting
tool), a large (>10 cm length), limestone tertiary flake, a green tuff tertiary flake, and a white chert tertiary
flake.
Feature 8 was a 1 m diameter, circular hearth with roughly 30 pieces of burned limestone that ranged
from 50-60 cm in diameter. The feature was adjacent to Feature 7. No carbon-stained sediment was
observed; however, the feature was partially buried within a small hummock stabilized by mesquite and
creosote bush and had potential for subsurface integrity. One limestone tertiary flake was associated with
this feature. This feature differs from the other circular hearths; large limestone rocks mark the
circumference, similar to a historic or modern hearth.
The artifact concentration was a 10 x 6 m area that contained mostly high quality, fine-grained chert.
The concentration was located approximately 5 m southeast of the ROW. The dominant material type was
fine-grained, opaque, white chert (n = 10), followed by limestone (n = 6), fine-grained, opaque, gray to black
chert (n = 5), and orthoquartzite (n = 1). The majority of debitage was small flake fragments, which suggest
that final reduction was the primary activity. Debitage consisted of tertiary flakes (n = 8), a primary flake,
miscellaneous flake fragments (n = 11), and shatter (n = 2).
Treatment Recommendations: The AT&T ROW crosses the site northeast/southwest for 160 m. Initial
treatment recommendations for 41CU648 were for construction monitoring (Kearns et al. 2001a, 2003).
Prior to the initiation of construction, however, the construction company requested additional work space
(AW-12) within the site and an I/E route (TX-83B) across the site. The work space was located mainly on
bedrock at the eastern edge of the site along the southern edge of the ROW boundary. The additional work
space was necessary to build a level platform because of the slope of the terrain and a large, deep arroyo.
The 30.5 x 3.5 m (100 x 10 ft) work space had a number of large boulders in and along it. It appeared that
these boulders were originally in the way of construction of the Dell telephone line and had been moved onto
and adjacent to the AT&T ROW. Feature 7 was located on bedrock in the area to be disturbed and had been
essentially destroyed during earlier construction. A shallow arroyo ran south from Feature 7 and appeared to
have been used as track hoe access for construction of the Dell telephone line or an earlier AT&T line.
Feature 7 was exhaustively mapped and recorded. The feature lacked integrity and did not contribute to the
eligibility of 41CU648. It was recommended that AW-12 be approved and that a monitor be present during
construction of the platform. The recommendation was approved by the THC (D. Beene to C. Wheeler,
letter 1 October 2008, WCRM, Farmington, New Mexico).
An existing road that curved through the site was necessary to facilitate construction. The I/E route
(TX-83B) extended from U.S. Highway 62/180 across 41CU748, then across three previously bladed ROWs
to the AT&T ROW. Prior to reaching the AT&T ROW, the route split (TX-83B) and traveled up a
35

maintained road on a pipeline ROW to a perpendicular, bladed road. This bladed road traveled southeast
through 41CU648 to a north/south-trending drainage and then northeast back to the AT&T ROW. Most of
the perpendicular road within the site boundary had been bladed to bedrock; however, one stretch that headed
into the north/south-trending drainage was within fine-grained sediment. Feature 18, a burned rock
concentration, was located within this stretch. A trowel test of the feature indicated that the burned rock was
redeposited and lacked integrity (see description of Feature 18, below). It was recommended that I/E route
TX-83B be approved with the following restrictions. Use of the road would be restricted to a tracked boring
machine and rubber-tired support vehicles. Wide-tracked vehicles (i.e., greater than the width of the road)
would not be allowed. All use of the road would be monitored by an archaeologist; the route would be
fenced through the site. The THC also requested photos documenting use of the road and the AT&T ROW
before, during, and after construction.
Treatment Results: Construction through the site in the ROW and in additional work space AW-12 was
monitored. No intact deposits were found. A temporary fence was constructed along the edges of I/E route
TX-83B, use of the route was monitored, and construction was photographically documented (Figures 11Â­
20). There were no additional construction incidents.
As part of the I/E route evaluation, an artifact sample transect was documented, 20 features (Features
9-28) and a large burned rock concentration were described, and the site boundary of 41CU648 was defined.
Artifacts from a 150 x 20 m sample transect were examined. They included 19 pieces of shatter, and
three primary, eight secondary, and 25 tertiary flakes. Tools from the sample transect included three
retouched/utilized flakes, four cores, five scrapers, five large agave knives or choppers, three bifaces, and
one projectile point.
Outside the sample transect, other artifacts noted included eight additional projectile points (although
not typed), one scraper, one metate fragment, and two brown ware sherds. Hundreds of artifacts were
probably present across the site.
During the evaluation, the boundary of Feature 1 was extended to the east, across the bladed road
(TX-83B). The portion of Feature 1 on the eastern side of the road was approximately 4 x 3 m and roughly
circular except where the western portion had been truncated by the road. Burned rock was eroding from the
eastern cut bank of the road, and some rock had been scattered onto the road. The additional portion of the
feature consisted of a dense configuration of approximately 75-125 burned and fractured cobbles of
limestone (90 percent) and sandstone (10 percent), ranging from 4 to 14 cm (average 8 cm). No carbon
stains or charcoal flecks were observed. Five chert tertiary flakes, one limestone unifacially worked flake,
and one piece of quartzite shatter were noted within the feature.
Feature 9 was a 1.4 x 1.2 x 0.1 m, roughly circular burned rock concentration located in the
northwestern portion of the site at the junction of a bladed northwest/southeast-trending road (TX-83) and a
bladed north/south-trending road. The feature had been truncated by the blading and eroded with a major rill
cutting into the western portion. The erosion had exposed approximately 0.1 m of subsurface carbon stains.
It consisted of approximately 35 pieces of burned limestone and sandstone ranging from 4-10 cm. Sparse
charcoal flecks were observed. Several small roots are present in the eroded portion of the feature. No
artifacts were within the feature or in the vicinity. It is likely that Feature 9 was a small roasting pit similar
to many others documented at the site.
Feature 10 consisted of two rock rings forming a figure 8. The first was a roughly circular 4.3 x 4.0
m ring located in the northwestern portion of the site, approximately 2 m north of the bladed pipeline road
(TX-83). It consisted of approximately 40 limestone and sandstone cobbles ranging between 20 and 35 cm
in diameter. Sparse vegetation and sand had accumulated in the center of the ring. No stains were observed;
however, the feature was resting on dark, cultural sediment. Several cobbles were located outside the ring

and may have been part of the feature at one time. Eight pieces of burned limestone were located to the
south and upslope of Feature 10. A smaller, 2.5 x 2 m, roughly circular ring of approximately 12 limestone
and sandstone cobbles was adjacent and directly north. It was unclear if the smaller ring was cultural or
natural. One piece of chert shatter and two pieces of limestone shatter were located 1 m upslope to the east.
Function of the feature was known.
Feature 11 was a 9 x 0.5 m, roughly oval concentration of burned rock eroding from the eastern cut
bank of the northwest/southeast-trending road (TX-83). It consisted of 27 burned limestone and sandstone
pieces ranging from 5 to 12 m. Feature 11 was eroding from the dark, cultural sediment and was adjacent to
and east of Feature 10. No distinct carbon stains or artifacts were observed in direct association with the
feature. Feature 11 was likely a small roasting pit similar to other features documented on the site.
Feature 12 was a roughly circular 1.5 x 1.4 m burned rock concentration located approximately 14 m
west of the north/south-trending road (TX-83B) in the south-central portion of the site. The feature was
eroding from dark, cultural sediment on a southwest-trending slope and had several rills running through it.
Feature 12 consisted of 35 burned and fractured limestone cobbles ranging from 4 to 15 cm. No carbon
stains or artifacts were identified in the feature.
Feature 13 was a roughly oval 0.5 x 0.4 m concentration of burned rocks located approximately 0.25
m west of the north/south-trending road (TX-83B). It consisted of 14 pieces of burned and fractured
limestone ranging from 3 to 12 cm. The feature was partially buried in the dark, cultural sediment and
partially covered by more recent eolian sand. No carbon stains or artifacts were observed in direct
association. Feature 13 was likely a roasting pit.
Feature 14 was a roughly oval 5 x 3 m burned rock concentration located approximately 2.5 m west
of the north/south-trending road (TX-83B) in the south-central portion of the site. It was deflated and
eroding from dark, cultural sediment on a southwest-trending slope. A large gully cut across the western
portion of the feature. Feature 14 consisted of a somewhat dense configuration of approximately 100 pieces
of burned limestone ranging from 2 to 12 cm. It was partially buried in the dark, cultural sediment; however,
no carbon stains were observed within the rocks. Artifacts observed within the feature included two
limestone cores, one quartzite secondary flake, approximately 10 chert tertiary flakes, and one chert
unifacially worked flake. Feature 14 appeared to be a deflated and eroded roasting pit.
Feature 15 was an amorphous, 0.8 x 0.6 m burned rock concentration located approximately 1.2 m
north of Feature 14 and 3.2 m west of the north/south-trending road (TX-83B). It was composed of
approximately 15 burned limestone cobbles ranging from 7 to 14 cm. The feature had been partially buried
by eolian sand, and no carbon stains were observed. One secondary limestone flake and one chert biface
thinning flake were within the feature. Feature 15 was probably a buried roasting pit; however, it was
possible that Feature 15 and Feature 14 were exposed portions of the same feature.
Feature 16 was a 1.6 m diameter burned rock concentration located approximately 3 m west of the
north/south-trending road (TX-83B) on a southwest-facing slope. The feature consisted of approximately 50
pieces of burned and fractured limestone and sandstone pieces ranging from 3 to 11 cm. It was within the
dark, cultural sediment; however, no carbon stains were observed. The feature was deflated, and the western
portion was dispersed and extended an additional 3 m downslope. One limestone core, one chert secondary
flake, and five chert tertiary flakes were observed.
Feature 17 was an amorphous 5.7 x 5.6 m burned rock concentration located at the southern end of
the rocky outcrop, in the southern portion of the site. It was approximately 1 m east of the north/southÂ­
trending road (TX-83B). The feature was resting on both bedrock and on small portions of the dark, cultural
sediment. It was deflated, eroded, and dispersed and consisted of approximately 150 burned and fractured
limestone (90 percent) and sandstone (10 percent) pieces. The burned pieces ranged from 3 to 12 cm
(average 8 cm). No dark carbon stains or charcoal flecks were observed. Artifacts located within the feature
42

included two limestone cores, two pieces of chert shatter, one limestone secondary flake, and three chert
tertiary flakes. One chert secondary utilized flake and one piece of ground sandstone were also noted.
Feature 17 was located approximately 4 m south of Feature 26 which was very similar in appearance.
Feature 18 consisted of two light carbon stains and several pieces of burned rock in a 0.7 x 0.3 m
area. The northern stain measured 18 x 8 cm, and the southern stain was 16 x 12 cm. A chert core was
located approximately 8 cm north of the northern stain. The feature was located in the bladed road (TX-83B)
in an area that was roughly 60 cm below mgs. Some burned rock and alluvial gravel were located adjacent to
(<10 cm) and south of the southernmost stain. It was unclear if the rock placement was the result of alluvial
movement or if the rock had been exposed in the rill. A trowel test trench was excavated across the eastern
half of the two stains of mottled, carbon-stained silt and the area between to determine if they retained any
integrity. Fill between the two stains was light tan silt. Two pieces of rock were exposed in the northern
stain at 1 cm below the bladed surface, and some charcoal flecks were observed. The stains and rock likely
had been either redeposited or had experienced severe erosion and blading, and retained no integrity.
Feature 19 was a 1.0 x 0.8 m amorphous carbon stain located at the northwestern boundary of the
site near the junction of a bladed northwest/southeast-trending road and a bladed north/south-trending road
(both TX-83B). It was situated approximately 0.9 m from the cut bank of the bladed roads and
approximately 10 m southwest of Feature 9. The feature consisted of six pieces of burned rock in a dark
carbon stain with sparse charcoal flecks. Features 9 and 19 were located in dark, cultural sediment. No
artifacts were within the feature or in the vicinity. Feature 19 was probably a truncated roasting pit, though it
could be a concentration of stained sediment associated with the dark, cultural sediment.
Feature 20 was a 3.8 x 2.1 m concentration of burned rocks located toward the northern portion of
the site, adjacent to and northeast of a bulldozer push pile and approximately 10 m southwest of the rocky
outcrop. The feature consisted of approximately 75-100 burned and fractured limestone (90 percent) and
sandstone (10 percent) pieces ranging from 2 to 14 cm (average 8 cm). The feature was deflated, and the
burned rock was dispersed and eroding down a south-trending slope. It was within the dark, cultural
sediment. No dark carbon stains or charcoal flecks were observed. Two tertiary limestone flakes were in the
feature.
Feature 21 was a roughly circular, 1.6 x 1.5 m burned rock concentration located at the southern end
of the site on a slight, southeast-trending slope. It was a tight configuration of approximately 30 burned
limestone pieces ranging from 7 to 15 cm. No carbon stains or artifacts were observed in direct association
with the feature. A 60 x 40 cm scatter of burned limestone, located approximately 30 cm to the northwest,
was likely the result of a single discard episode. Feature 21 was probably a roasting pit.
Feature 22 was a roughly circular, 2.3 x 2.3 m burned rock concentration located at the southern end
of the site on a slight, southeast-trending slope. It was deflated and eroding from the slope. Feature 21 was
located approximately 4 m to the northeast. No carbon stains were observed in direct association with the
feature, which was a dispersed configuration of approximately 30 pieces of burned and fractured limestone
ranging from 5 to 13 cm. One piece of chert shatter was observed within the feature. A dense concentration
of debitage, including six chert tertiary flakes, one mudstone tertiary flake, two pieces of chert shatter, and
two limestone tertiary flakes, was located approximately 50 cm to the southwest. Feature 22 was likely a
deflated roasting pit.
Feature 23 was a set of two bedrock mortars located in the northeastern portion of the site on top of
the rocky outcrop. The mortars were on a large, 3 x 2.1 m sandstone boulder just south of a high point on the
outcrop. They were oriented on a northwest/southeast axis. The western mortar measured 0.18 x 0.15 x 0.08
m; the eastern measured 0.16 x 0.15 x 0.05 m. No artifacts were located on top of the boulder, though
artifacts were present within the vicinity. The western mortar was slightly eroded, with only a small portion
(45 percent) of the smooth interior surface remaining. This locale offered a good view of most of the site.

43

Feature 24 was a roughly oval, 3.1 x 2.8 m burned rock concentration located toward the southern
end of the site on a slight, southeast-trending slope. Feature 24 was deflated and dispersed and rested on
sandstone bedrock. No carbon stains were present. The feature was composed of approximately 50 burned
and fractured limestone cobbles ranging from 8 to 10 cm. No artifacts were observed in direct association
with the feature. Feature 24 was probably the remains of a roasting pit that had deflated to bedrock.
Feature 25 was an amorphous, 5.6 x 5 m burned rock concentration located approximately 2 m east
of the north/south-trending road (TX-83B) in the southern portion of the site. The feature was southwest of
the rocky outcrop on a southwest-trending slope. The feature was deflated and had eroded downslope. The
northeastern portion of the feature rested on sandstone bedrock, and the remainder rested on the dark,
cultural sediment. It consisted of approximately 100-125 burned and fractured limestone and sandstone
cobbles ranging from 3 to 18 cm. No dark carbon stains or charcoal flecks were observed. One piece of
chert shatter and one quartzite secondary flake were located within the rock mass.
Feature 26 was an amorphous, 6.7 x 6.6 m burned rock concentration located on the southern
terminus of the rocky outcrop in the southern portion of the site. The feature was deflated, and the burned
rock was dispersed on top of the sandstone bedrock. A small portion (approximately 1 x 1 m) of the
southwestern end of the feature was resting on the dark, cultural sediment. The feature consisted of
approximately 125 to 150 burned and fractured limestone (90 percent) and sandstone (10 percent) pieces.
They ranged from 4 to 10 cm (average 05 cm). No carbon stains or charcoal flecks were observed. One
limestone core, three limestone tertiary flakes, and one limestone Stage II biface were located within the
feature.
Feature 27 was a roughly circular, 1.2 x 1.1 m burned rock concentration located on the southern
terminus of the rocky outcrop in the southern portion of the site. It was approximately 3 m northeast of the
north/south road (TX-83B). The feature was resting on both the dark, cultural sediment and bedrock, and
was partially buried by recent eolian sand. It consisted of 30 burned and fractured limestone (90 percent) and
sandstone (10 percent) pieces ranging from 4 to 10 cm (average 7 cm). The burned rock was tightly
clustered. No carbon stains or charcoal flecks were observed. No artifacts were located within the feature,
but a dense concentration of debitage and tools was adjacent and extended up to 3 m north of the feature. It
included two limestone cores, 10 to 15 limestone and chert flakes, one projectile point, and one sandstone
bifacially utilized mano.
Feature 28 was a burned rock concentration adjacent to the bladed north/south-trending road (TXÂ­
83B), 12 m south of Feature 1. It measured 1.3 x 1.2 m. The feature appeared to be eroding from the cut
bank. The eastern edge had been damaged by previous blading, and some of the rock on the cut bank may
have been mechanically pushed there from Feature 1. No charcoal was evident, though the rock appeared to
be in the darker cultural sediment.
The burned rock concentration was a 35 x 25 m area of burned and fragmented rock located in the
southwestern portion of the site. Burned rock was eroding from rills and gullies and moving downslope to
the southwest. There were 500+ limestone (85 percent) and sandstone (15 percent) cobbles that ranged from
2 to 15 cm (8 cm average); however, no distinct areas of carbon stains or charcoal flecks were observed. It
was unknown how many parent features produced the discarded material. Hundreds of artifacts were present
within this area.
Condition: The site has been crossed by several pipeline corridors and telecommunication ROWs; however,
because of the large size of the site, it remains in good condition.
Significance and National Register Eligibility: Site 41CU648 retains integrity and has been previously
determined eligible (P. Smith to C. Wheeler, fax transmission, 2 October 2001, BLM, Las Cruces, New
Mexico). Subsurface features are evident in the road cuts. The carbon-stained sediment within many of the
thermal features could address chronometric research domains. Intact deposits within feature fill could also
44

address paleoenvironmental research domains. It is recommended that 41CU648 remain eligible for the
NRHP under criterion (d).
Site Number: 41CU748
Temporary Number: WCRM 01/02/08 â P/HS4
Cultural/Temporal Affiliation: Prehistoric/unknown; Historic/Modern period
Site Type: Lithic scatter with thermal features; trash scatter
Site Description: Site 41CU748 was a 92 x 79 m (302 x 259 ft) multicomponent historic trash dump and
sparse prehistoric lithic scatter containing three thermal features (Figure 21). The site was recorded in 2008
by WCRM for a potential reroute as part of the AT&T NexGen/Core Project (Sullivan-Owens 2008); it was
located roughly 305 m (1,000 ft) west of Guadalupe Canyon and 21 m (69 ft) northeast of U.S. Highway
62/180 (see Figure 2 and Appendix A). Site 41CU748 was situated on an alluvial valley floor that drained
into the larger Salt Flat Basin. Vegetation consisted of creosote bush, mesquite, narrowleaf yucca, barberry,
snakeweed, and assorted grasses and forbs.
Site 41CU748 was initially identified as a 19 x 16 m, sparse lithic scatter with one thermal feature of
unknown temporal and cultural affiliation and a historic or modern component (Sullivan-Owens 2008). The
thermal feature was documented as a small, thermally altered, limestone and sandstone hearth with ash stains
and charcoal just below the surface. The site was in fair condition and appeared to retain intact cultural
deposits; however, both natural and artificial forces had resulted in moderate impact to the site.
Treatment Recommendations: Site 41CU748 was located adjacent to U.S. Highway 62/180. A wellÂ­
maintained, bladed road through the site was the only viable exit from the highway where heavy equipment
could be brought from the highway on trucks and off-loaded, given the concerns of the landowner, terrain,
and Texas Department of Transportation. Access to 6,000 ft or more of ROW was controlled by this egress
(TX-83) from the highway. Based on the well constructed and maintained character of the existing road and
its previous use for construction of pipelines, telephone lines, and an existing fiber optic line, no additional
impact would result to site 41CU748 if travel was restricted to the existing road (Figure 22). Travel of heavy
trucks and equipment on this road will be monitored to ensure no impact to the site.
Treatment Results: Traffic using the road across the site was monitored and there were no impacts to the
site. During updating of the site prior to use of the I/E route, additional features were found and the site
boundary expanded.
Current investigations resulted in identification of two additional thermal features (Features 2 and 3).
An extensive historic trash dump, Concentration A, and widely scattered historic debris were also identified.
Feature 2 was a burned rock pile located roughly 30 m east-southeast of Feature 1 below an outcrop
of large boulders and adjacent to an intermittent drainage. It measured 5 x 3 m and consisted of
approximately 75 large rocks (average size 15 cm) exposed on the surface. Numerous small rock fragments
were dispersed among the larger rock. Associated artifacts included two orthoquartzite primary flakes and
one limestone scraper plane.
Feature 3 (4 x 3 m) was located approximately 5 m south of Feature 2 and consisted of
approximately 50 pieces of burned rock (average size 15 cm) exposed on the surface. The burned rock was
mostly limestone, but quartzite and sandstone were also present. No artifacts were associated with Feature 3.

Concentration A was a sparse scatter of cans and glass throughout the central and eastern half of the
site. Concentration A was an approximately 79 x 59 ft (24 x 18 m) historic trash dump containing cans,
bottle glass, porcelain, Fiesta ware, white improved earthenware, and miscellaneous metal objects. Sanitary
cans were the most numerous items and included more than 100 specimens. Other metal objects included at
least seven hole-in-cap milk cans, two Log Cabin syrup cans, one church key-opened beverage can, one lard
pail (or small paint can), three coffee cans, two meat cans, at least three 1-quart oil cans, 27 crown caps, three
external friction lids, one internal friction lid, two threaded lids, three strands of baling wire (unknown
length), two fence staples, one file fragment, one razor blade, one aluminum lamp collar (inscribed WHITE
FLAME LIGHT GRAND RAPIDS MICHIGAN), one purse clasp, two metal battery cases, and one 12
gauge shotgun shell primer (PETERS/H.V./MADE IN U.S.A./12). Bottle glass included one complete
condiment bottle (Tabasco?), one fingernail polish bottle, 14 bottle bases with makers' marks, at least six
bottle finishes (threaded and crown cap), and numerous fragments of colorless (n = >100), brown (n = >75),
light green (n = >50), dark green (n = 2), and cobalt blue (n = 22) glass. Six of the bottle bases were CocaCola bottles from El Paso, Texas (n = 5) and Deming, New Mexico (n = 1). Makers' marks on the remaining
bottle bases indicated manufacture dates between the 1920s and 1960s. Historic ceramics included at least
70 fragments of china or porcelain, 15 fragments of orange-glazed and 16 fragments of blue-glazed Fiesta
ware, and at least 10 fragments of white improved earthenware. Some of the ceramic objects contained floral
decals over glaze, painted patterns under glaze, and embossed floral patterns. One lid fragment from a
serving dish or tea pot and half of a white improved earthenware cup were also identified. The artifacts in
Concentration A were mainly domestic with a small amount of automotive trash, probably from a nearby
service station.
Historic artifacts in the remaining portions of the site included a widely dispersed scatter of cans
(mostly sanitary cans but also hole-in-cap and 1-quart oil cans) and bottle glass, as well as a set of mattress
springs. A jumble of roughly 3-4 x 1 ft sandstone blocks, a metal pipeline cap, and barbed wire were located
in the southeastern portion of the site in what appeared to be a push pile along the edge of a bladed pipeline
ROW. The shaped sandstone blocks were probably originally associated with erosion control features or
47

culverts along the historic, paved El PasoâCarlsbad Highway (41CU661) and were redeposited during ROW
construction.
Condition: Fair. Site appeared to retain intact cultural material.
Significance and National Register Eligibility: Site 41CU748 has been previously recommended eligible
for the NRHP under criterion (d) (Sullivan-Owen 2008). No eligibility determination has been made for the
site, however. The site appears to retain intact cultural deposits including two prehistoric features and one
historic dump. The prehistoric component could provide information about the hunter-gatherer lifestyle
within the Trans-Pecos region of Texas. The historic trash could provide additional insight into lifeways in
rural west Texas during the mid-twentieth century. Therefore, 41CU748 retains an eligible recommendation
to the NRHP under criteria (a) and (d).
Site Number: 41CU649
Temporary Number: Field 2116 (Matt 4)
Cultural/Temporal Affiliation: Prehistoric/late Paleoindian-transitional Archaic, Late Archaic;
Historic/Modern period
Site Type: Lithic scatter with thermal features; Historic trash scatter
Site Description: Site 41CU649 was a multicomponent site with a Late Archaic, Hueco phase roasting
locale, a prehistoric artifact scatter, a debitage concentration, a late Paleoindian/transitional Archaic
projectile point, and a historic trash scatter and concentration. The site was first documented during the
resurvey for the AT&T NexGen/Core Project (Kearns et al. 2003). The site was excavated during the
treatment phase of the AT&T project, and the following description was summarized from Jones (2009).
The site measured 83 x 43 m, with an arbitrary boundary on the southeastern edge (Figure 23). The site area
was not determined because the site extends a considerable distance southeast of the ROW. The site was
located on land administered by Guadalupe Mountains National Park and was south of the Guadalupe
Mountains and west of the Delaware Mountains in an area of rocky hills and basins (see Figure 2 and
Appendix A). It was on a south-trending slope in a basin between two hills (Figure 24). Shallow, braided
washes dissected the basin, and intermittent drainages bordered the western and southwestern margins of the
site and crossed the central portion of the site. Vegetation was dominated by creosote bush with mesquite,
soaptree yucca, and various grasses.
Subsurface investigations revealed a single stratum with a maximum observed depth of 28 cm. The
sediment was light yellowish brown to yellowish brown (10YR 6/4-5/4), loose to moderately consolidated
clay loam with moderate pediment development. Discontinuous patches of Stage II carbonate development
were noted within the stratum, and the sediment had been disturbed by roots and insects. All recovered
artifacts were either from the modern ground surface or from full-cut contexts within Stratum I.
Five features were recorded on this site (Kearns et al. 2003). Two hearths (Features 1and 2) were
excavated during the treatment phase of the project (Jones 2009).

Figure 24. Overview of 41CU649 along AT&T ROW. View is to northeast.
Three other features and prehistoric and historic artifact concentrations were located well outside the
ROW and were not investigated (Jones 2009). The prehistoric artifact concentration was described during
the initial inventory as a light scatter of flakes dominated by high-quality, fine-grained chert with some
limestone and quartzite. Features 3 and 4 were hearths, and Feature 5 was noted but not documented. Based
on the presence of burned rock, Feature 4 might be another roasting locale. The historic artifact scatter noted
southeast of the ROW during inventory included hole-in-cap cans and hinged-lid tobacco tins dating between
1920 and 1950. This trash might be associated with travel along the historic, paved El PasoâCarlsbad
Highway, a section of which is approximately 150 m east of the ROW.
Treatment investigations began with a surface collection in the ROW that resulted in the recovery of
23 pieces of debitage and seven flaked stone tools. Although no further investigation of the historic
component was initially recommended (Kearns et al. 2001a), nondiagnostic automobile glass, a tobacco tin,
and an unidentified can were noted within the ROW during the surface collection. Two activity areas were
defined as a result of the investigations.
Activity Area 1 was a 25.0 x 23.5 m area that contained a roasting locale with two features (see
Figure 23). Fifteen pieces of debitage, two flaked stone tools, one late Paleoindian/transitional Archaic
Golondrina projectile point, and 214 pieces of burned rock were recovered. The artifact assemblage reflected
production of expedient flake tools that were probably associated with the processing of vegetal resources.
Manufacture and retouch of formal tools was also indicated. The projectile point might reflect limited use of
the area within the late Paleoindian/transitional Archaic time frame.
Feature 1 was a rock-filled, basin-shaped hearth or roasting pit with an irregular shape. The feature
measured 1.05 x 0.75 x 0.18 m. Feature fill was unconsolidated, grayish brown (10YR 5/2), carbon-stained
clay loam with flecks and small pieces of charcoal that occurred in patches beneath the burned rocks.
Approximately 44 burned rocks (5.8 kg) were removed from the hearth. The rocks were locally occurring
sandstone and quartzite that ranged in size from 5 to 17 cm. Charcoal from the feature excavation was
50

identified as oak (Quercus sp.) and indeterminate wood. Additional charcoal from the excavation block was
identified as mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa). Oak and mesquite most likely served as fuel for the hearth.
Oak charcoal was submitted for radiocarbon analysis and returned a 2-sigma date range of A.D. 150-390.
Feature 2 was a 0.55 x 0.30 x 0.07 m, oval, rock-filled, basin-shaped hearth. Slope wash had
truncated the northeastern third of the feature and mixed the feature fill with noncultural sediment. The
peripheral feature fill was pale brown (10YR 6/3), carbon-stained, clay loam of mixed sediment. The
primary feature fill remained only in the center of the feature and consisted of much darker, grayish brown
(10YR 5/2) clay loam with many charcoal flecks. Stratum I sediment beneath the feature fill was brighter
yellow and harder than that surrounding the feature, indicating that it had been thermally altered. Feature 2
contained more than 25 rocks that ranged in size from 3 to 14 cm and weighed more than 7 kg. It had likely
contained more burned rock prior to truncation. Charcoal from Feature 2 was identified as mesquite
(Prosopis glandulosa), and indeterminate wood charcoal. The mesquite was most likely used as fuel for the
hearth; it was submitted for radiocarbon dating and returned a 2-sigma date range of A.D. 110-330.
Activity Area 2 was a spatially discrete scatter of artifacts and burned stone in the northern portion of
the ROW (see Figure 23). The scatter measured 12.5 x 11.0 m and included 11 pieces of debitage, two cores,
two flake tools, and 285 pieces of burned rock. The artifacts and burned rocks probably represented a
disturbed roasting locale. The debitage assemblage included shatter of limestone and quartzite, secondary
flakes of chert and quartzite, and tertiary flakes of chert and quartzite. The cores were of locally available
quartzite; cores and debitage of local material types reflect core reduction associated with the production of
expedient flake tools. The flake tools from Activity Area 2 included a chert flake that had been utilized for
cutting and a quartzite scraper. These tools probably reflect the processing of vegetal material for roasting.
Twenty-six pieces of debitage were recovered from 41CU649, including six pieces of shatter, 10
secondary flakes, and 10 tertiary flakes. Raw material types included limestone, chert, quartzite, and
sandstone. The quartzite was likely obtained from one or both of two nearby quarry sites (41CU652 and
41CU654), limestone outcrops were ubiquitous in this portion of the project area, and sandstone benches
outcrop on the nearby hills. Chert, however, was not available in the immediate vicinity, and the nearest
potential sources are the outcrops and pediment gravel of Guadalupe Ridge (several kilometers to the
northwest) and the Diablo Plateau, which begins approximately 30 km to the southwest.
Seven tools were recovered, including two cores, one late Paleoindian/transitional Archaic
Golondrina projectile point, one tabular knife, one scraper, one cutting tool, and one multifunctional
scraper/cutting tool. Material types include local limestone and quartzite, and chert that is not from the
vicinity of the site.
The projectile point was a late Paleoindian Plainview or, more likely, a late Paleoindian/ transitional
Archaic Golondrina point and might reflect a late Paleoindian/transitional Archaic occupation. The
characteristics of these points overlap somewhat, and this specimen can be classified as both types based on
Kelly's (1982) scheme. The date ranges for both point types fall within the Plano tradition in the TransPecos region circa 8000-6000 B.C. (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004).
The flaked stone assemblage from 41CU649 reflected a range of potential activities. Expedient
scraping and cutting tools are consistent with those for processing vegetal resources; the tool forms are
similar to those from limited activity roasting locales in the AT&T project area, including New Mexico sites
LA 130721, LA 130729, and LA 132529 (Jones et al. 2010), and the tabular knife was similar to purported
mescal knives. The projectile point suggested additional activities. If the projectile point was not scavenged
or collected by Late Archaic occupants, it might reflect implement repair or hunting during a late
Paleoindian/transitional Archaic occupation.
Treatment Recommendations: The AT&T ROW crossed the site north/south for 62 m. GMNP personnel
required that all earth-disturbing activities on the site be monitored.
51

Treatment Results: All construction activities were monitored and no cultural material was encountered.
Construction was completed without incident.
Condition: The site had been impacted by erosion from numerous washes, cattle grazing, rodent burrowing,
and previous construction within the ROW; it was in fair condition.
Significance and National Register Eligibility: Site 41CU649 was previously determined eligible for the
NRHP under criterion (d) (P. Smith to C. Wheeler, fax transmission, 2 October 2001, BLM, Las Cruces,
New Mexico). The site contains three unexcavated features and the prehistoric artifact concentration outside
the ROW; all remain in good condition. The features might provide macrobotanical and radiocarbon
samples that would lead to a better understanding of the chronology and possibly episodic use of roasting
locales and could yield evidence of a late Paleoindian occupation. The historic component contains an
uninvestigated historic trash scatter. The scatter is outside the ROW and is in good condition; it has the
potential to provide data regarding use patterns of the historic, paved El PasoâCarlsbad Highway, a
regionally important historic travel route. Consequently, archaeological research potential has not been
exhausted, and it is recommended that the site remain eligible for the NRHP under criterion (d). Site
41CU649 may also be eligible for the NRHP under criterion (a).
Site Number: 41CU660
Temporary Number: Field 2150
Cultural/Temporal Affiliation: Prehistoric/Middle and Late Archaic, Late Archaic-early Formative,
Mogollon; Historic/Modern period
Site Type: Habitation locale with thermal features; highway with trash scatter
Site Description: Site 41CU660 was a multicomponent site with an Archaic residential component,
transitional Late Archaic to early Formative period roasting locales, Mogollon roasting locales, an abandoned
segment of the historic, paved El PasoâCarlsbad Highway (41CU661), and a historic artifact scatter. The site
was originally recorded by ASLM (Martin and Knight 2000). The site form was updated by WCRM during
the damage assessment and subsequent resurvey of the AT&T NexGen/Core Project (Kearns and Berrigan
2001; Kearns et al. 2003). Portions of the site were excavated, and the following description was
summarized from Jones (2009), the treatment report for the AT&T NexGen/Core Project. The site was
located on private land in an area of rolling hills and small valleys south of the Guadalupe Mountains, east of
Salt Flat, and west of Brushy Mesa and the Delaware Mountains along Guadalupe Arroyo (see Figure 2 and
Appendix A). It was situated in stabilized coppice dunes, interspersed with blowouts, on a broad terrace
along the southern margin of Guadalupe Arroyo. Sediment was eolian silt loam. Vegetation was dominated
by creosote bush and honey mesquite. Four-wing saltbush, soaptree yucca, tarbush, prickly pear cactus, and
various grasses were also present.
WCRM personnel described the site as an extensive scatter of burned rock, debitage, flaked stone
tools, ground stone milling equipment, and occasional sherds (Kearns and Berrigan 2001; Kearns et al.
2003). El Paso Brown, Jornada Brown, and El Paso Polychrome sherds indicated a Formative period
component with a Jornada Mogollon cultural affiliation. The entire site was not recorded; the site extended
at least 250 m between the southern terrace of Guadalupe Arroyo and the southernmost feature and 320 m
between the westernmost feature and State Route 54 to the east. Cultural material was identified north of
Guadalupe Arroyo, and the site boundary was extended 495 m to the north (Figure 25). Thirty-six burned
rock features (Features 1-36) occasionally associated with black, charcoal-stained sediment were noted in the
recorded area. A 75 x 55 m area of dense cultural debris and dark, carbon-stained sediment resembling a
midden deposit was also noted in the central portion of the site.

Excavation at 41CU660 both inside and outside the ROW resulted in identification of a sitewide
stratigraphic sequence, identification of 10 study units, and exploration of 48 features and subfeatures (Jones
2009). In addition to the features identified on the ground surface within the ROW during the original
survey, subsurface investigations exposed 37 additional features and four subfeatures (Table 10). Twentyeight features that were previously identified (Features 1, 2, 5, 6, 8-11, 16-32, 34-36) were not investigated.
Feature 13 was noncultural, as were newly assigned Features 56, 60, and 70. Feature 58 was not an assigned
number.
Subsurface investigations resulted in identification of four strata, including two that occurred across
the site. Stratum I was pale brown (10YR 6/3), loose sandy loam. Stratum II was slightly compacted pale
brown (10YR 6/3), sandy loam. In Block 1Stratum I ranged from 1 to 34 cm thick. Stratum II had a
maximum thickness of 17 cm. Two additional strata were observed in Block 4. Stratum III was slightly
darker, compacted, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sandy loam. Stratum IV was very well compacted, light
yellowish brown (10YR 6/4,) sandy loam with calcium carbonate nodules. Strata I-III were eolian in origin,
and Stratum I had recently eroded from the underlying sediment and been redeposited. The origin of the
Stratum IV sediment could not be determined. Cultural material was present in Strata I-III.
Ten study units were defined as a result of the investigations and data analyses (Figure 26 and Table
11). These included in Block 1 a Middle Archaic Camp Locale, a Late Archaic Occupation, two roasting
locales (Roasting Locales 1 and 2), a Hearth-centered Activity Area, and a set of Uncorrelated Features. A
Historic study unit was located in Blocks 1 and 4. An additional roasting locale (Roasting Locale 3) was
investigated with Block 2. The Midden Deposit in the central portion of the site was investigated with
Blocks 3-7. The remaining investigations were assigned to a GSA study unit.
Investigations in the Middle Archaic Camp Locale resulted in the excavation of three hearths
(Features 66, 67, and 68) and six postholes (Features 40, 59, 69, 71, 75, and 77) (see Table 11). Radiocarbon
assays from Features 66-68 returned 2-sigma date ranges of 3340 to 3210 B.C. and 3190 to 2920 B.C., 3350
to 3020 B.C., and 3350 to 2920 B.C., respectively. These dates are similar and indicate use within the
Middle Archaic period. Features 66-68 (hearths) and Features 69, 71, and 77 (postholes) all had identical
points of origin and were likely associated. The tops of Features 40 and 59 were probably smeared and were
not identified until slightly lower. Although Feature 75 (posthole) was first identified below the other
features, it was probably associated based on the posthole configuration. The construction of the pit structure
(Feature 3) probably removed the top of Feature 75. The postholes were probably the remains of a brush
structure or ramada.
Investigations in the Late Archaic Occupation resulted in the excavation of one pit structure
(Features 3), one central hearth (Feature 3.1), one warming pit (Feature 3.3), one posthole (Feature 3.6), one
entryway (Feature 3.7), and one extramural hearth (Feature 63) (see Table 11). Radiocarbon assays from
Features 3.1, 3.3, and 63 returned 2-sigma date ranges of 1300 to 1030 B.C., 1270 to 1000 B.C., and 1280 to
1010 B.C., respectively. These ranges significantly overlapped and placed the use of the area in the early
portion of the Late Archaic Hueco phase.
Investigations in Roasting Locale 1 resulted in the excavation of three roasting pits (Features 47, 48,
and 76), one burned rock discard pile (Feature 72), and an indeterminate thermal feature (Feature 50) (see
Table 11). A radiocarbon assay from Feature 76 returned a 2-sigma date range of 50 B.C.-A.D. 100, placing
use of the feature within the Late Archaic period, though postdating the occupation of the Late Archaic pit
structure and associated features (see above). The proximity and similar point of origin of the features as
well as a radiocarbon assay date range indicate an association.

Roasting Locale 2 contained two hearths (Features 52 and 54), and two roasting pits (Features 53 and
55). The artifact assemblage from the study unit consisted of one unidentifiable quartzite metate fragment
recovered from Feature 54, and one quartzite tertiary flake recovered from Feature 55. The calibrated 2Â­
sigma date ranges from Feature 55 were A.D. 260 to 300 and A.D. 310 to 430. This placed the use of the
feature in the transitional Late Archaic/early Formative periods. The dates were essentially the same as those
from the Hearth-centered Activity Area. It is possible that both study units were "family" hearth and roasting
locales occupied at the same time. Activities in Roasting Locale 2 were most likely associated with the
cooking of presumably locally acquired foodstuffs.
Investigations in the Hearth-centered Activity Area resulted in the excavation of six hearths
(Features 37, 41, 43, 44, 45, and 46), one roasting pit (Feature 42), one burned rock discard pile (Feature 4),
and one indeterminate feature (Feature 61) (see Table 11). The points of origin of the features were similar
and they were likely associated. Radiocarbon dates from four hearths and one roasting pit indicate use of the
activity area between A.D. 250 and 580. This places the use of the Hearth-centered Activity Area in the
transitional Late Archaic/early Formative period.
Investigations in the Uncorrelated Features study unit resulted in the excavation of two hearths
(Features 62 and 64), a roasting pit (Feature 73), an indeterminate thermal feature (Feature 51), and two
postholes (Features 65 and 74) (see Table 11). These six features could not be correlated with any of the
other temporal components, and no datable material was recovered. It was unclear if these features were
associated with any of the other features identified within Block 1.
The Historic study unit consisted of debris associated with the historic, paved El PasoâCarlsbad
Highway (41CU661), a historic fence post (Feature 57) (see Table 11), and 848 historic artifacts. Historic
artifacts were found throughout all strata, with the majority in Stratum II. Other than the excavation of
Feature 57, the historic component of the site was not formally investigated.
Investigations in Roasting Locale 3 resulted in the excavation of one roasting pit (Feature 7) and one
hearth (Feature 49) (see Table 11). Features 7 and 49 were probably contemporaneous, based on their
vertical and horizontal proximity. One radiocarbon assay from Feature 7 returned a 2-sigma date range of 40
B.C.-A.D. 130, placing the use of the feature during the Late Archaic period. The radiocarbon assay date
range from Feature 7 was almost identical to the date range returned from Feature 76, a similar roasting pit
identified in Roasting Locale 2 approximately 8.5 m to the southeast. Features in both study units may have
been contemporaneous and associated.
Investigations in the Midden Deposit resulted in the excavation of five redeposited cultural features
(Features 12, 14, 33, 38, and 39) (see Table 11) and subsurface explorations at five locales (Blocks 3-7). A
grouping of five burned rock and artifact concentrations (Features 25-29) was identified within the Midden

Deposit and outside the ROW to the east. A radiocarbon assay from Feature 38 returned a date range of A.D.
690-900, which placed use or occupation of the area in the Mesilla phase of the Jornada Mogollon sequence.
Activities associated with the midden possibly included manufacture and maintenance of lithic tools,
processing and roasting of local vegetative matter, and cooking of small mammals. Because the portion of
the midden in the ROW was disturbed, it is unclear whether these activities occurred within the midden
proper or within the general area.
Investigations in the GSA resulted in the excavation of one feature (Feature 15) consisting of
redeposited cultural material (see Table 11). No datable material was recovered from the block, because it
had been thoroughly disturbed and sediment was believed to be in secondary context.
Site 41CU660 yielded 4,568 artifacts. These included 3,536 lithic artifacts, 63 ceramics, 117
nonhuman bones, four shell, and 848 historic artifacts. The lithic artifacts included 3,422 pieces of debitage,
63 flaked stone tools, and 51 pieces of ground stone.
Debitage represented 97 percent (n = 3,422) of the total lithic assemblage. Sixty-one percent (n =
2,143) of the debitage were tertiary flakes, 17 percent (n = 602) were secondary flakes, and 2 percent (n =
60) were primary flakes.
The 63 flaked lithic tools included two pieces of assayed raw material, four cores, 15 utilized flakes,
one piece of retouched shatter, four pieces of retouched/utilized shatter, 11 retouched/utilized flakes, two
choppers, two tabular knives, two scraper planes, five scrapers, 10 bifaces, and five projectile points or
fragments.
Of the five projectile points or point fragments recovered, two were fragments of the same tool.
Combined, they formed a large, corner-notched point within the range of the San Pedro style or possibly a
variation on the "Carlsbad Point" (Leslie 1978:133), or "Hueco" style (MacNeish 1993:182). One was a
small, corner-notched point resembling Leslie's (1978) Type 3A and/or a possible Scallorn variant (Suhm
and Jelks 1962). The manufacturing date of the style was within the Late Archaic period. Another was an
indeterminate point fragment, but the size indicated a Late Archaic or early Formative affiliation. Finally,
one point was an indeterminate fragment with no style or age category.
Fifty-one pieces of ground stone were recovered from the site. These included three shallow basin
metates, two indeterminate handstones, 14 indeterminate pieces of ground stone, 30 indeterminate metate
fragments, one lapstone, and one pecking stone.
Assayed raw material, cores, and all stages of core reduction flakes indicated that initial stages of
tool manufacture, as well as finishing stages and tool maintenance, were performed. Retouched and utilized
flakes were used for cutting, chopping, and/or scraping tasks. Formal scrapers, choppers, and knives were
present on site. Projectile points in the assemblage indicated that some reliance on hunting occurred during
the occupation. The ground stone indicated some reliance on vegetative processing for consumption. The
absence of trough metates probably indicates a greater reliance on hard seeds than corn.
The ceramic assemblage from 41CU660 included 63 ceramic artifacts, 19 of which were too small
for analysis. The remaining 44 were identified as Jornada Brown, El Paso Brown, and Chupadero Black-onÂ­
white. With the exception of three Jornada Brown bowl fragments, all of the sherds were from jars. No
evidence of use wear and sherd reworking was identified. Examination of tempering material suggested that
two of the Jornada Brown sherds were from a vessel produced in the Sierra Blanca region, and the
Chupadero Black-on-white sherds were from a vessel produced in the Pueblo Colorado area of central New
Mexico. The remaining sherds had tempering material that was inconclusive of a specific source.
The faunal assemblage at 41CU660 contained 117 bone fragments representing a minimum of six
individuals including a small bird, a kangaroo rat, a wood rat, a squirrel, a jackrabbit, and a cottontail rabbit.
61

The bird material corresponds to several fragments of an eggshell. The squirrel specimen showed evidence
of carnivore gnawing and may be naturally deposited or transported material. Several of the small mammal
fragments were charred or calcined, suggesting that some portion of the assemblage, most likely the
jackrabbit and/or hare, is of cultural origin.
Four shell items were recovered from 41CU660 within Stratum II less than 20 cm below the ground
surface. The shells included two complete unmodified pond snails (Stagnicola sp.), one partial pond snail
fragment, and one possibly ornamental, unidentifiable fragment. The presence of pond snails reflected a
moist environment. The ornamental fragment was possibly a large circular disk.
One macrobotanical sample, one radiocarbon sample, and 21 flotation samples were collected from
the site. The samples were recovered from 11 hearths, five roasting pits, one warming pit, one indeterminate
feature, and two pockets of redistributed material. Fuel wood recovered from hearths was composed
primarily of mesquite and woody legume-type wood and saltbush-type wood. A few fragments of chollaÂ­
type wood, buckthorn-type wood, and lotebush wood were also identified in the samples. No seeds, fruit
fragments, or other edible plant fragments were recovered from the samples. The better fuel types (mesquite
and woody legume) were recovered from the hearths with rock and from the roasting facilities; saltbush-type
wood was recovered primarily from the hearths lacking rocks.
Radiocarbon dates indicated that 41CU660 was occupied at least five times over a span of
approximately 4,000 years. It was initially occupied during the Middle Archaic period between 3350 and
2920 B.C. Assays from three hearths (Features 66, 67, and 68) all returned dates within this range. The six
postholes suggested a brush structure or ramada in association with these thermal features. Dates from two
interior hearths (Features 3.1 and 3.3) of the pit structure (Feature 3) between 1300 and 1000 B.C. indicated a
Late Archaic occupation. An additional date range from a hearth (Feature 63) associated with the pit
structure also returned a similar date range (1280-1010 B.C.). Samples from two roasting pits (Features 7
and 76), located in Roasting Locale 1 and Roasting Locale 3, respectively, also returned Late Archaic date
ranges between 50 B.C. and 130 A.D. This was substantially later than the pit structure. Assays from four
hearths (Features 37, 43, 44, and 45) located in the Hearth-centered Activity Area returned date ranges of
A.D. 250 to 580. These placed the use of the area within the Late Archaic/early Formative period. A single
assay from a roasting pit (Feature 55) located in Roasting Locale 2 returned similar date range of A.D. 260Â­
430. An assay from redeposited cultural material (Feature 38) located in the Midden Deposit returned a date
range of A.D. 690-900, placing use of the midden in the Mesilla phase of the Formative period.
Chronometric material indicated that the site was occupied at least six times over approximately
4,000 years (Table 12). The data indicated that the subsistence strategy changed little over time, and
evidence of extralocal interaction was limited to ceramics. Ground stone indicated seed grinding, and though
projectile points were found that indicated hunting, the paucity of faunal evidence indicated that large game
was not a subsistence resource. The site apparently functioned as a camp locale during the Middle to Late
Archaic and was used primarily for roasting activities in later occupations.
Treatment Recommendations: The AT&T ROW crosses the site northeast/southwest for approximately
600 m. Site 41CU660 was not originally slated for construction monitoring; however, during a spot check of
construction activity by an archaeological monitor, it was discovered that construction activities were taking
place outside the ROW within the site boundary. Gravel was being taken out of Guadalupe Arroyo (an
intermittently activity channel). No damage was done to the cultural resources of the site. It was
recommended that additional work on the site in the ROW be monitored. See Construction Incidents, this
report.
Treatment Results: Following discovery of the violation, no further incidents occurred and no cultural
discoveries were made.

Condition: The site had been impacted by slope wash, cattle grazing, construction of the historic, paved El
PasoâCarlsbad Highway (41CU661), and previous construction within the AT&T ROW. The portion of the
site outside the ROW, however, was in good condition (Kearns et al. 2003).
Significance and National Register Eligibility: Site 41CU660 was previously determined eligible for the
NRHP under criterion (d) (P. Smith to C. Wheeler, fax transmission, 2 October 2001, BLM, Las Cruces,
New Mexico). The inhabitants of the site used pottery, carried on milling activities, and used stone tools for
cutting, scraping, chopping, and hunting tasks associated with food procurement and processing. The area
excavated and constructed through covered a very small percentage of the site, and there is considerable
63

evidence that additional subsurface cultural deposits exist outside the ROW. Therefore, archaeological
research potential has not been exhausted, and it is recommended that the site remain eligible for the NRHP
under criterion (d).
Isolated Occurrences
During the course of the current project, 17 IOs were identified (see Appendix A; Table 13).
Prehistoric IOs included a scatter of thermally altered limestone, one biface, two scrapers, one utilized flake,
one primary flake, two secondary flakes, one biface thinning flake, and two sherds. Historic IOs included
one survey marker, one erosion control feature, one water control feature, three cans, one metal box, one
bottle, solarized glass, Fiesta ware, and white earthenware. By definition, the IOs are considered not eligible
for the NRHP.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Various archaeological tasks were performed between December 2007 and November 2009. Eight
thousand one hundred sixty-nine meters of construction activities were monitored, which included 2,869 m
of site area and 5,300 m of nonsite area. Thirteen sites were monitored during construction, eight of which
are updated in this report. The eight sites are on land managed by Guadalupe Mountains National Park
(GMNP [41CU667), GMNP/private (41CU646 and 41CU651), Texas Department of Transportation/ private
(41CU748), and private landowners (41CU647, 41CU648, 41CU649, and 41CU660). Three of the
monitored sites were temporarily fenced during construction. Surveyed areas totaled 259.32 acres and
included one reroute, 20 new ingress/egress routes, 21 areas of additional work space (including some I/E
routes to work spaces), and 30 rock piles/water bars in five locations outside the ROW. One new site was
discovered, but because of private landowner concerns, it was not recorded. New features on two previously
recorded sites (41CU648 and 41CU748) were discovered and documented.
NRHP eligibility
recommendations for the 12 of the 13 sites did not change as a result of the work. Nine sites were
recommended to remain eligible under criterion (d), one site under criterion (a), and two sites under criteria
(a) and (d); and one site that had been recommended only under criterion (d) was recommended eligible
under both criteria (a) and (d). Seventeen isolated occurrences were identified. They are considered not
eligible for the NRHP, and current documentation is sufficient to offset any potential, adverse impacts. No
additional work is recommended for this project.

Environmental/Topographical Setting
The site was located in Guadalupe Mountains National Park. It was situated on the southeast-facing pediment of
the Guadalupe Mountains in an area of low limestone hills and ridges created by entrenched drainages and small
canyons. The site was on a bench bounded on the east, north, and west by the narrow, spring-fed, Smith Canyon,
near Choza Spring. The surface deposit was silty clay loam with areas of gravel. Smith Canyon contained a
narrow riparian zone that supported a mixed floral assemblage of pinyon pine, ponderosa pine, alligator juniper,
and littleleaf walnut, along with a number of wetland species. Vegetation was dominated by juniper and scrub oak,
along with soaptree yucca, prickly pear, beargrass, and various grasses.

Discussion of Site
Site 41CU646 was a multicomponent Archaic and Formative/Late Prehistoric camp and roasting locale with a
historic trash scatter and features. The site was originally recorded by Archaeological Services by Laura Michalik
(ASLM) (Martin 2000). The site form was updated by WCRM during the resurvey portion of the AT&T
NexGen/Core Project (Kearns et al. 2003). Portions of the site were excavated and the following description was
summarized from Jones (2009), the treatment report for the AT&T NexGen/Core Project. The site measured 200 x
170 m (656 x 558 ft) and was located on the southeast-facing pediment of the Guadalupe Mountains. It was on a
bench bounded on the east, north, and west by the narrow Smith Canyon, which supported a riparian mixed floral
assemblage. The 9.3 m (30.5 ft) wide northeast/southwest-trending ROW bisected the western one-third of the site
for 195 m (640 ft).
Twenty-seven features were identified on the site, including 22 prehistoric thermal features, two historic road
segments, one prospect pit, and two historic trash concentrations. Prehistoric artifacts from the surface outside the
ROW included 115 flakes, two projectile point bases, and one complete Scallorn point. Only two pieces of ground
stone (both metates) were noted, and there were no ceramics.
Four of the prehistoric features (11, 11.1, 13, and 20) were previously investigated (Jones 2009). Spatial analysis
of the surface artifacts and feature locations resulted in the identification of four prehistoric study units including
one camp locale, two camp and roasting locales, and the general site area (GSA). Site stratigraphy was also
identified, and the historic component was investigated.

Surface collection from the ROW resulted in the recovery of 2,445 lithic artifacts (2,261 pieces of debitage and
184 tools) and 59 historic artifacts. One long bone fragment 2 cm long that was from a dog- or deer-sized mammal
was also recovered.
Subsurface investigations revealed four strata. The strata consisted of loose, unconsolidated sediment over a series
of increasingly consolidated, silty clay loam strata with calcium carbonate flecks and inclusions increasing with
depth. Cultural material was found mainly in the upper 20 cm of the sediment profile (i.e., in Strata I and II).
Artifacts on the surface and in Stratum I were considered to be in secondary context as a result of the mechanical
disturbance. Stratum II artifacts appeared not to be mechanically disturbed but to have suffered from some
bioturbation. The numerous artifacts present in the first level of Stratum III were probably the result of natural
mixing at the contact of Strata II and III and the few artifacts found in the lower levels of Stratum III and in
Stratum IV appeared to be the result of bioturbation.
The Camp Locale measured 36 x 9.3 m. Only lithic artifacts were recovered. Surface collection and Stratum I
produced 476 pieces of debitage and 34 tools. Fifty-three pieces of debitage and no tools were recovered from
Stratum II. Debitage and tools indicate that core reduction, tool manufacture and maintenance, cutting, scraping,
and graving took place within the activity area. The four complete and 10 fragmented projectile points indicated
hunting and hunting equipment maintenance activities. Projectile points included one Early to Middle Archaic
point, three Middle Archaic points, five Late Prehistoric points, and five indeterminate points. The presence of
both Middle Archaic and Late Prehistoric projectile points probably indicated occupation during both of these time
periods. Although, no hearths were found in the ROW, the wide range of activities represented by the artifacts
indicated that the area was probably a camp locale.
Camp and Roasting Locale 1 was 36 x 13.5 m and defined by a lithic artifact scatter and Feature 20. Lithic
artifacts were found on the surface, in Strata I and II, and in the top of Stratum III. Feature 20 was a 7.3 x 6.3 m
surface stain and a sparse scatter of burned rock and flaked lithic artifacts. Only 25 percent of the feature was
within the ROW. The large size of Feature 20 indicated that it was probably either a burned rock discard pile or
the deflated remains of several roasting pits in proximity to each other. Artifacts from the activity area included
417 pieces of debitage and 34 tools, including eight projectile points, from the combined modern ground surface
and Stratum I. There were 16 pieces of debitage recovered from Stratum II and six pieces of debitage from the top
of Stratum III. Debitage and tools indicated that tool manufacture and maintenance, scraping, and cutting were
taking place. The eight projectile point bases indicated the repair of hunting equipment and hunting activities.
Dating of Camp and Roasting Locale 1 was difficult and was based on projectile point types. Four of the projectile
points were temporally indeterminate, one appeared to range from Early to Middle Archaic, one was probably from
either the Middle or the Late Archaic, and two were Late Archaic in style. The points indicated both Middle and
Late Archaic occupations of the locale. The diversity of activities and the burned rock scatter (Feature 20)
indicated that the study unit served as a camp and roasting locale.
Camp and Roasting Locale 2 measured 64 x 24 m and contained Features 11, 11.1, and 13. It was defined by the
extent of the features and lithic artifacts. Surface artifacts from the activity area included 1,204 pieces of debitage
and 94 tools. Lithic artifacts from the 14 nonfeature units included 1,041 pieces of debitage and 15 tools,
including six projectile points. The artifacts were generally found in Strata I and II, and in the top of Stratum III.
Although debitage counts varied between the stratigraphic proveniences, percentages of debitage type and material
type were fairly consistent in the three strata.
ï¿½Feature 11 was a large burned rock ring midden (15.6 x 14.8 x 0.73 m). The rock was generally rounded
limestone, although tabular sandstone was also present in the ring. There were 1,911 pieces of debitage, 33 tools,
13 fragments of eggshell from a medium-sized bird, and three tooth enamel fragments; two were artiodactyl (one

charred), and the other was identifiable only as a dog- to deer-sized mammal. Macrobotanical analysis produced
woody legume, oak, pine, buckthorn, juniper or pine, and indeterminate wood. The samples indicated that all of
species were probably used as fuel wood. Feature 11.1 was the central roasting pit of Feature 11, and only half of
it was exposed. The feature measured 1.29 x 0.55 x 0.22 m, and the fill contained 20 pieces of burned rock and
one piece of debitage. A flotation sample from beneath the rocks yielded oak and indeterminate wood fragments;
both were probably used as fuel wood. Radiocarbon dates from Feature 11 and 11.1 indicated that the ring midden
was used intermittently between A.D. 140 and 630, and some activities may have taken place on top of the
partially filled ring midden around A.D. 1440. Investigation indicated that the location of the central roasting pit
probably remained constant, with the inner portion of the ring being maintained space. Analysis of the quantity of
burned rock and feature size indicated approximately 580 episodes of use of Feature 11 and 11.1.
Feature 13 was a large burned rock midden, of which approximately 25 percent was in the ROW. Overall, the
feature was probably oval and measured 2.8 x 6.4 m x 0.27 m tall. It consisted of a mass of burned limestone and
quartzite cobbles that ranged from 1 to 12 cm. One hundred twenty-four lithic artifacts were recovered, including
120 pieces of debitage and four tools.
ï¿½
Artifacts recovered from Camp and Roasting Locale 2 included 4,277 pieces of debitage and 146 tools; 26
projectile points were recovered. Twenty-two of the points were incomplete and two of the four complete points
were reworked. Debitage from Camp and Roasting Locale 2 indicated that tool production and maintenance were
taking place, including the production of bifaces. Broken and reworked projectile points also indicated that
hunting and the retooling of hunting equipment were conducted. The other tools indicated that scraping and
cutting/chopping occurred.
The chronology of Camp and Roasting Locale 2 was based on both radiocarbon dating and the presences of
projectile points. The 26 projectile points included one Middle Archaic, eight Late Archaic, two Late
Archaic/Early Formative, eight Formative/Late Prehistoric, and seven indeterminate. All of the radiocarbon dates
came from Features 11 and 11.1. The dates indicated that Camp and Roasting Locale 2 was repeatedly occupied
between A.D. 140 and 630, the transitional period from the Late Archaic (Hueco phase) to the early Formative
(Mesilla phase); some activities may have taken place on top of the partially filled ring midden between A.D. 1410
and 1480 (late El Paso or Ochoa phase).
The GSA was defined in the ROW as the area of the site outside the other established study units. The area was
investigated with 38 (4 x 4.65 m) surface collection units and two subsurface 1 x 1 m units. Surface collection
resulted in the recovery of 193 lithic artifacts, including 179 pieces of debitage and 14 tools. Forty-four pieces of
debitage were recovered from the subsurface units; however, no tools were found. Prehistoric artifact types from
the GSA were similar to the types from the three activity areas and occurred in similar percentages, although in
much smaller quantities.
Within the ROW, a sparse scatter of 85 historic artifacts was recovered. Historic artifacts included items of
ceramic, glass, metal, Bakelite, and paper. The trash appeared to be a combination of domestic, ranch, and
automobile-related items. The full date range of the trash was 1890-1959, but it probably dated to the late 1930s
and 1940s. Outside the ROW were two road segments, one prospect pit, and two historic trash concentrations
(Kearns et al. 2003). The trash concentrations probably dated ca. 1925, and the road segments were probably
historic in age and used as access to the dumping areas. The age of the prospect pit was indeterminate. The trash
in the ROW was in disturbed context; however, some of it may have been associated with the trash dumps that
probably dated to the 1920s. Much of the trash in the ROW appeared to date from the 1930s to the 1940s and was
probably associated with additional trash dumping episodes, the prospect pit, or construction of the AT&T cable in
the late 1940s.

Lithic artifacts numbering 5,796 were recovered from the ROW and excavated portion of the site outside the
ROW. These included 5,554 pieces of debitage and 242 flaked stone tools. Debitage from 41CU646 was
indicative of tool manufacture and maintenance. Eighty-four percent of the projectile points were incomplete,
indicating that retooling of hunting equipment was also taking place. Other lithic tools indicated that cutting and
scraping were common activities and that chopping and graving were also taking place. Material types in all
proveniences were dominated by chert (generally around 70 percent), followed by limestone (generally around 15
percent). Combined counts of quartzite, mudstone, siltstone, sandstone, and obsidian combined, made up less than
15 percent of the material types. All of the lithic material types were locally available except for obsidian. The
obsidian came from Mule Creek on the ArizonaâNew Mexico border, which indicated trade with groups to the
west.
Five faunal specimens and six pieces of shell were recovered from the site. Faunal specimens included one
specimen (13 fragments) of chicken-sized bird eggshell, one long bone fragment from a dog- to deer-sized
mammal, and three tooth enamel fragments, two of which were artiodactyls (one charred), and the other was
identifiable only as dog- to deer-sized mammal. The eggshell and enamel fragments were recovered from mixed
contexts; consequently, their association with the prehistoric use of Feature 11 was unclear, although the charring
of the artiodactyl enamel fragment probably indicated a prehistoric affiliation. The long bone fragment was from
the surface. The six pieces of shell included three fragments of unmodified pond snail, a hinge fragment from a
freshwater bivalve, and two unidentifiable fragments. The three fragments of pond snail were too small and fragile
to measure but were probably Stagnicola sp., which reflected a moist environment. The hinge fragment was most
likely from a Tampico pearlymussel shell (Cyrtonaias tampicoensis), which occurs from northeastern Mexico into
central Texas (Howells 1996:1), including the Pecos River Basin (Lang and Mehlhop 1996).
Eight flotation samples and 11 macrobotanical and flotation samples were analyzed from the ring midden (Feature
11), the central roasting pit (Feature 11.1), and a burned rock concentration (Feature 13). The two samples from
Feature 13 contained no botanical remains. Macrobotanical samples from Features 11 and 11.1 contained oak,
pine, woody legume, pine/juniper, buckthorn, and an indeterminate wood. The sample probably represents fuel.
Edible plant remains were not identified.
Chronological data for 41CU646 came from both projectile points and radiocarbon dating. Fifty projectile points
were recovered from the site. Temporally, the points included two possibly Early/Middle Archaic, four Middle
Archaic, one Middle/Late Archaic, 10 Late Archaic, four Late Archaic/Formative, and 13 Formative/Late
Prehistoric. Sixteen points were indeterminate. All but two points came from mixed context, and some of the
points may have been curated items. Four radiocarbon samples from Features 11 and 11.1 indicated that at least
one portion of the site was repeatedly occupied between A.D. 140 and 1480. Projectile points indicated occupation
during the period between the Early/Middle Archaic and the Formative/Late Prehistoric. The radiocarbon dates
confirm the middle and end part of the sequence between the end of the Late Archaic and the Formative/Late
Prehistoric.
ï¿½Site 41CU646 appeared to be repeatedly occupied between the Early/Middle Archaic and the late Formative/Late
Prehistoric. The location of the site on a bench above the well-watered Smith Canyon and Choza Spring was an
ideal setting for both gathering and hunting. The general lack of ground stone (none was recovered from the ROW
and only two pieces, both metates, were noted outside the ROW) indicated that seed processing was not a common
activity, and although the area was utilized during the Formative/Late Prehistoric period there was a noticeable
lack of ceramics. Numerous roasting features indicated that succulent cooking was probably taking place.
The Early and Middle Archaic periods were represented by six projectile points. Two of the points dated to the

transition from the Early to Middle Archaic; both were reworked. Four points dated to the Middle Archaic; three
were broken and one was complete. The broken points indicated tool maintenance, and the points in general
indicate big game hunting. One burned rock concentration (Feature 20) and one Tampico pearlymussel shell
fragment were located in mixed Middle and Late Archaic context. Although the feature and shell fragment may be
associated with the Middle Archaic points, the association was not definitive.
The Late Archaic component was represented by Feature 11 (burned rock ring midden), possibly Feature 20
(burned rock concentration), and 11 projectile points. Two Late Archaic dates were obtained from Feature 11;
both ranged from cal A.D. 140 to 380. As mentioned above, Feature 20 (burned rock concentration) and one
Tampico pearlymussel shell fragment were located in a mixed Middle and Late Archaic context and cannot
definitively be associated with either. The burned rock indicated that succulents were probably being processed,
which was usually done in the winter or spring. One of the points spanned the Middle to Late Archaic period and
10 dated solely to the Late Archaic. The points indicated that hunting was taking place in the vicinity during the
period. Nine of the points were broken and two were reworked, inferring that tool maintenance was taking place
as well.
The Late Archaic/early Formative component contained a burned rock ring midden (Feature 11), central roasting
pit (Feature 11.1), and four projectile points. Three radiocarbon dates between A.D. 140 and 630 were obtained
from the features. Two of the four projectile points were broken. Data from the ring midden indicated that
succulents were probably being processed, which was usually done in the winter or spring. The projectile points
indicated that hunting tool maintenance and large game hunting activities were taking place.
The late Formative/Late Prehistoric period was represented by a burned rock ring midden (Feature 11) and 13
projectile points. One radiocarbon date from the postabandonment fill of the ring midden dated to A.D. 14101480. Twelve of the 13 Formative/Late Prehistoric points were broken. Data from the ring midden indicated that
succulents were probably being processed, and that the site was used in the winter or spring. The projectile points
indicated that hunting tool maintenance and large game hunting activities were taking place.
In addition to the points and radiocarbon-dated burned rock features, also recovered were Mule Creek obsidian,
Tampico pearlymussel shell, and dog- or deer-sized tooth remains. These items were from mixed contexts and
could not be isolated temporally. The faunal remains were possible evidence of reliance on big game. Mule Creek
obsidian indicated contact with groups farther west along the New MexicoâArizona border; the nearest source of
Tampico pearlymussel was the Pecos River to the east. Based on similar percentages of lithic material types and
tool types from all of the contexts, it can be inferred that similar activities were probably taking place during all of
the temporal components from the Middle Archaic through the Formative/Late Prehistoric. Activities included
succulent roasting, hunting, tool production and maintenance (including hunting equipment), cutting, scraping, and
graving.
The historic component consisted of a general scatter of trash, two dumped trash concentrations, two road
segments, and a prospect pit. The trash appeared to be a combination of domestic, ranch, and automobile-related
items dumped in the 1920s and late 1930s-early 1940s.
Treatment Recommendations: The ROW traversed the site northeast/southwest for 195 m. Investigations at
41CU646 had cleared the site for construction; however, at the request of LSI and GMNP personnel, all earthdisturbing activities and heavy equipment crossings of the site were monitored. Pickups and backhoes were
allowed to cross the site without a monitor. Also, the construction company requested a 75 x 40 ft area of
additional work space (AW-5) for a bore rig at Choza Creek.

Treatment Results: Survey of AW-5 revealed one limestone flake and two pieces of burned rock, and the area was
approved for construction use by GMNP. Construction within the ROW was completed without incident.
Condition: Although the portion of the site within the ROW has been impacted by construction, the portion of the
site outside the ROW is in good condition.
Significance and National Register Eligibility: Site 41CU646 was previously determined eligible for the NRHP
under criterion (d) (P. Smith to C. Wheeler, fax transmission, 2 October 2001, BLM, Las Cruces, New Mexico).
Burned rock features observed outside the ROW retain the potential to provide significant information regarding
roasting locales and/or open camps in the Trans-Pecos region. Specifically, these features might provide
information regarding targeted subsistence resources and could provide better understanding of the range of
activities that occurred at such sites. Therefore, archaeological research potential has not been exhausted, and it is
recommended that the site remain eligible for the NRHP under criterion (d).

Discussion of Site
Site 41CU647 was a short-term, open prehistoric camp with a historic road and associated fence line that transect
the site in a west/northwest to east/southeast direction. The site was first recorded by WCRM during the resurvey
for the AT&T NexGen/Core Project, and the following description was summarized from the initial survey report
(Kearns et al. 2003). The site was located in the foothills of the Guadalupe Mountains. The Delaware Mountains,
Capitan Peak, and Guadalupe Peak were visible to the west-northwest. The site was situated on a small saddle
between two low hills to the east and west. The site continued upslope, along a gradual, north-trending slope,
which merged into a relatively narrow basin. Site 41CU647 was approximately 60 m north of an unnamed
intermittent drainage. Sediment was gravelly silt loam. The floral community was transitional, with upland desert
species alongside species that dominated the lower elevations. Flora consisted of a mix of small junipers,
mesquite, cane cholla, allthorn, sumac, banana yucca, beargrass, faxon yucca, Torrey's yucca, purple prickly pear,
agave, and small cylindrical cacti. To the north, within the narrow valley, various species of grasses dominated the
floral community, along with sumac, mesquite, and cane cholla.
The prehistoric component of 41CU647 was a large scatter of burned limestone with a relatively meager scatter of
chipped stone debitage and two thermal features. The site measured approximately 130 x 30 m. Hundreds of
pieces of burned limestone are diffusely scattered throughout the site. Limestone was also the prevalent material
type for the chipped stone. Other material types included green volcanic tuff, quartzite, and chert. Chipped stone
tools were expedient forms that included two small ovate scrapers and a large, limestone retouched tertiary flake
that appeared to have served as a cutting tool.
Feature 1 was a 4 x 4 m concentration of burned limestone in the southern portion of the site. The concentration
appeared to be a deflated thermal feature. The concentration consisted of roughly 100 pieces of limestone that
ranged from 5-10 cm in diameter. No artifacts or carbon stains were observed within the concentration. The area
was highly deflated by alluvial erosion.
Feature 2 was a 1.0 m diameter hearth. The feature was partially deflated and consisted of approximately 50 pieces
of burned limestone that averaged 10 cm in diameter. Feature 2 was located approximately 15 m west of the
ROW. Carbon-stained sediment was visible in the feature fill. Two limestone flakes, one primary and one
tertiary, were associated with the feature. Numerous pieces of burned limestone have been displaced and washed
downslope in a small gully.
The historic component consisted of an abandoned dirt road and a barbed wire fence that paralleled the road. This
component transected the northern edge of the site. The width of the road was 5 to 7 m, and the fence was located
approximately 23 ft (7 m) south of the road. The barbed wire was identified as a possible Baker's Barb, Needlepoint Variation. The original patent (number 273219) for this barbed wire was February 27, 1883. The road and

fence line continued an unknown distance.
Feature 3 was a possibly historic hearth located within southern portion of the AT&T ROW, approximately 5 m
northwest of Station Pole 2086. The circular hearth was approximately 2.5 ft (0.75 m) in diameter, with stones
arranged around the outside perimeter of the circle. The stones were only slightly burned. Two large cans of
indeterminate type were encountered near the hearth. Both were 8 inches in diameter. One can read ESTAB 22,
and the other read UZ&T.
The prehistoric component of 41CU647 appeared to be a short-term, limited activity locale. The site was located
in a unique ecosystem that currently supports a variety of cactus species. The floral variety suggests that the site
may have served as a seasonal harvesting station. The prehistoric component lacked temporally diagnostic
artifacts and can only be assigned to an unknown prehistoric affiliation. The lack of ceramics at this site, however,
could indicate a preceramic temporal affiliation. The Baker's Barb, Needle-point Variation wire associated with
the historic component of the site suggested a date ranging from the latter part of the Middle Statehood period to
the Modern period (ca. 1883-1950).
Treatment Recommendations: The AT&T ROW crossed the site north/south for 128 m. The original treatment
recommendation for the site was to monitor all earth-disturbing activities and heavy equipment crossings during
construction. Backhoes and pickups were allowed to cross without a monitor. A temporary sediment fence was
placed along the western edge of the ROW where the ROW cut along the slope of a hill. The fence was used to
prevent sediment from rolling downslope and into the ROW. Erection of the fence and initial blading through the
site were monitored. Subsequent monitoring of construction was deemed unnecessary.
Treatment Results: No cultural remains were encountered. Construction was completed without incident.
Condition: The site was in poor condition. Alluvial deflation was evident; numerous gullies and shallow washes
truncate the site from a rocky slope adjacent to and southwest of the site. Other impacts included previous
construction in the AT&T ROW and what appears to be minimal traffic by local ranch workers along the ROW.
Significance and National Register Eligibility: Carbon-stained sediment associated with Feature 2 (outside the
ROW) indicated that portions of the site retained integrity and could provide chronometric data and information
regarding prehistoric land use and subsistence practices. The tool assemblage could address technological research
domains. The abandoned road and historic fence line could address issues that pertain to early transportation and
ranching. Site 41CU647 was previously recommended eligible for the NRHP under criteria (a) and (d) (Kearns et
al. 2003), and a similar recommendation is maintained.

Discussion of Site
Site 41CU648 was a large, repeatedly used prehistoric camp/habitation and roasting locale. The site was first
recorded by WCRM during the resurvey for the AT&T NexGen/Core Project and was updated during an ancillary
survey (Kearns et al. 2003; Proper 2005). The site had not changed from one recording to the next. The following
description was summarized from the initial survey report for the project (Kearns et al. 2003). It was located in
Guadalupe Canyon below the western flank of the Delaware Mountains along a gentle west-southwest-facing
slope. The site was bounded on the northern and southern sides by unnamed intermittent drainages that eventually
empty into Guadalupe Arroyo. The site was 500 x 215 m and situated around a north/south-trending sandstone
outcrop which rises approximately 10 m above the surrounding terrain. The northern half of the site appeared to be
an undisturbed anthrosol (dark, cultural sediment) composed of dark sandy loam. The southern half of the site
appeared to be a deflated anthrosol, and in many areas, artifacts and burned rock were resting on sandstone
bedrock. Sporadic patches of recent eolian deposits were present. The site was in a desert scrub community that
supported a creosote bush-dominant floral assemblage along with occasional yucca and prickly pear. The area
adjacent to and upon the sandstone outcrop supports a distinctively different floral community consisting of sumac,
scrub oak, cane cholla, beargrass, saltbush, acacia, several species of yucca, ephedra, and ocotillo, along with
various grasses.
Natural impacts to the site included slope wash, channel-cut erosion, and bioturbation. Mechanical impacts
included the AT&T ROW and ROWs for Dell Telephone Cooperative, Chevron Petroleum, an unnamed liquid
petroleum gas line, and El Paso Natural Gas pipelines. Also, several bladed roads transect the site.
During the original inventory, an area of approximately 160 x 47 m was documented. A 100 percent sample of the
debitage along the AT&T ROW was recorded. Material types include limestone, fine to medium-grained chert
with an array of colors, quartzite, and chalcedony. Limestone was the dominant material type, followed by chert,
quartzite, and chalcedony. Debitage exhibited all stages of reduction and included miscellaneous flake fragments
and shatter. Tertiary flakes (n = 21) were the dominant flake type, followed by primary flakes (n = 6) and
secondary flakes (n = 6). A lithic concentration (Concentration 1) was encountered that consisted of high quality,
fine-grained chert. All of the chipped stone tools were expedient items, which included a variety of both
unifacially and bifacially retouched flakes, a subtriangular scraper, multifunctional core/hammerstones,
core/choppers, and a crude, bidirectionally retouched, cobble chopper tool. A unifacial slab metate fragment that
had been pecked and smoothed was recorded. The metate was associated with a large midden deposit. It was
estimated that more than 1,000 pieces of burned rock and more than 100 pieces of debitage were scattered
diffusely throughout the site. Although no features were encountered within the ROW, eight thermal features were

recorded within 20 m of the ROW.
Feature 1 was a 7 x 5 m burned rock midden consisting of approximately 500 pieces of burned limestone (80
percent) and sandstone (20 percent). The average size of the burned rock was 10 cm in diameter. The midden was
eroding from a west-southwestâtrending slope. It was adjacent to the bladed road approximately 10 m southeast of
the AT&T ROW. No carbon stains were visible; however, subsurface investigations were not conducted. One
rounded, multidirectional core/hammerstone of limestone was associated with Feature 1.
Feature 2 was located approximately 10 m south of Feature 1. It was a 1 m diameter hearth with approximately 50
pieces of fire-cracked limestone (90 percent) and sandstone (10 percent) that averaged 10 cm in diameter. No
carbon stains were visible in the feature fill and no artifacts were associated. The location of Feature 2 suggested
that it was a hearth associated with Feature 1.
Feature 3 was a 2 x 1 m partially deflated hearth. It consisted of approximately 30-40 pieces of burned sandstone
(90 percent) and limestone (10 percent) that averaged 30 cm in diameter. The feature was eroding from a
southwest-trending slope, 16 m southeast of the ROW. No carbon stains were observed in the feature. Feature 3
was adjacent to a northeast/southwest-trending two-track road that paralleled the AT&T ROW.
Feature 4 was a 1.5 m diameter hearth that contained approximately 100 pieces of burned limestone (85 percent)
and sandstone (15 percent), ranging from 5 to 10 cm in diameter. No artifacts or carbon stains were observed in
the feature. The feature was 2 m southeast of the bladed road and 4 m north of Feature 1.
Feature 5 was a 7 x 2.5 m burned rock midden or roasting feature. It consisted of roughly 200 pieces of burned
limestone (60 percent) and sandstone (40 percent) that averaged 15 cm in diameter. The feature was severely
deflated and had no readily definable outline. Feature 5 was eroding from an east-trending slope on a narrow
bedrock terrace between two sandstone boulder outcrops, 22 m southeast of the AT&T ROW. No carbon stains
were visible. Artifacts associated with the feature included one piece of limestone shatter that exhibited unifacial
retouch along one lateral margin and one limestone multidirectional core that had been produced from a tabular
cobble.
Feature 6 was a 6 x 4.5 m burned rock midden adjacent to the northern side of the AT&T ROW. The midden was
resting on sandstone bedrock and was surrounded by large sandstone boulders on the northern and western sides.
These boulders may have served as wind or heat deflectors. The midden consisted of approximately 1,000 pieces
of burned limestone (99 percent) and sandstone (1 percent) that ranged from 5 to 10 cm in diameter. Artifacts
associated with the feature included a tabular limestone cobble with bifacial retouch along one lateral margin
(possibly a cutting tool), a limestone exhausted multidirectional core, a limestone Stage II oval biface, a limestone
tertiary flake, a piece of limestone shatter, and a limestone cobble with unifacial retouch along one lateral margin.
Faint carbon stains were observed within portions of the feature fill.
Feature 7 was a 10 x 6 m deflated and disturbed burned rock concentration. The feature was located adjacent to
the AT&T ROW; a small gully borders the western margin. The feature was on bedrock on a southsouthwestâtrending slope and was bordered on the north and east by sandstone boulders. No carbon stains were
observed. The concentration contained more than 2,000 pieces of burned limestone (95 percent) and sandstone (5
percent) that were poorly sorted and ranged up to 50 cm in diameter. Artifacts associated with this feature
included a sandstone unifacial slab metate fragment, a piece of orthoquartzite shatter, a limestone primary flake, a
limestone tertiary flake with retouch along one lateral margin (possible cutting tool), a large (>10 cm length),
limestone tertiary flake, a green tuff tertiary flake, and a white chert tertiary flake.

Feature 8 was a 1 m diameter, circular hearth with roughly 30 pieces of burned limestone that ranged from 50-60
cm in diameter. The feature was adjacent to Feature 7. No carbon-stained sediment was observed; however, the
feature was partially buried within a small hummock stabilized by mesquite and creosote bush and had potential
for subsurface integrity. One limestone tertiary flake was associated with this feature. This feature differs from
the other circular hearths; large limestone rocks mark the circumference, similar to a historic or modern hearth.
The artifact concentration was a 10 x 6 m area that contained mostly high quality, fine-grained chert. The
concentration was located approximately 5 m southeast of the ROW. The dominant material type was finegrained, opaque, white chert (n = 10), followed by limestone (n = 6), fine-grained, opaque, gray to black chert (n =
5), and orthoquartzite (n = 1). The majority of debitage was small flake fragments, which suggest that final
reduction was the primary activity. Debitage consisted of tertiary flakes (n = 8), a primary flake, miscellaneous
flake fragments (n = 11), and shatter (n = 2).
Treatment Recommendations: The AT&T ROW crosses the site northeast/southwest for 160 m. Initial treatment
recommendations for 41CU648 were for construction monitoring (Kearns et al. 2001a, 2003). Prior to the
initiation of construction, however, the construction company requested additional work space (AW-12) within the
site and an I/E route (TX-83B) across the site. The work space was located mainly on bedrock at the eastern edge
of the site along the southern edge of the ROW boundary. The additional work space was necessary to build a
level platform because of the slope of the terrain and a large, deep arroyo. The 30.5 x 3.5 m (100 x 10 ft) work
space had a number of large boulders in and along it. It appeared that these boulders were originally in the way of
construction of the Dell telephone line and had been moved onto and adjacent to the AT&T ROW. Feature 7 was
located on bedrock in the area to be disturbed and had been essentially destroyed during earlier construction. A
shallow arroyo ran south from Feature 7 and appeared to have been used as track hoe access for construction of the
Dell telephone line or an earlier AT&T line. Feature 7 was exhaustively mapped and recorded. The feature lacked
integrity and did not contribute to the eligibility of 41CU648. It was recommended that AW-12 be approved and
that a monitor be present during construction of the platform. The recommendation was approved by the THC (D.
Beene to C. Wheeler, letter 1 October 2008, WCRM, Farmington, New Mexico).
An existing road that curved through the site was necessary to facilitate construction. The I/E route (TX-83B)
extended from U.S. Highway 62/180 across 41CU748, then across three previously bladed ROWs to the AT&T
ROW. Prior to reaching the AT&T ROW, the route split (TX-83B) and traveled up a maintained road on a
pipeline ROW to a perpendicular, bladed road. This bladed road traveled southeast through 41CU648 to a
north/south-trending drainage and then northeast back to the AT&T ROW. Most of the perpendicular road within
the site boundary had been bladed to bedrock; however, one stretch that headed into the north/south-trending
drainage was within fine-grained sediment. Feature 18, a burned rock concentration, was located within this
stretch. A trowel test of the feature indicated that the burned rock was redeposited and lacked integrity (see
description of Feature 18, below). It was recommended that I/E route TX-83B be approved with the following
restrictions. Use of the road would be restricted to a tracked boring machine and rubber-tired support vehicles.
Wide-tracked vehicles (i.e., greater than the width of the road) would not be allowed. All use of the road would be
monitored by an archaeologist; the route would be fenced through the site. The THC also requested photos
documenting use of the road and the AT&T ROW before, during, and after construction.
Treatment Results: Construction through the site in the ROW and in additional work space AW-12 was
monitored. No intact deposits were found. A temporary fence was constructed along the edges of I/E route TX83B, use of the route was monitored, and construction was photographically documented. There were no
additional construction incidents.
As part of the I/E route evaluation, an artifact sample transect was documented, 20 features (Features 9-28) and a

large burned rock concentration were described, and the site boundary of 41CU648 was defined.
Artifacts from a 150 x 20 m sample transect were examined. They included 19 pieces of shatter, and three
primary, eight secondary, and 25 tertiary flakes. Tools from the sample transect included three retouched/utilized
flakes, four cores, five scrapers, five large agave knives or choppers, three bifaces, and one projectile point.
Outside the sample transect, other artifacts noted included eight additional projectile points (although not typed),
one scraper, one metate fragment, and two brown ware sherds. Hundreds of artifacts were probably present across
the site.
During the evaluation, the boundary of Feature 1 was extended to the east, across the bladed road (TX-83B). The
portion of Feature 1 on the eastern side of the road was approximately 4 x 3 m and roughly circular except where
the western portion had been truncated by the road. Burned rock was eroding from the eastern cut bank of the
road, and some rock had been scattered onto the road. The additional portion of the feature consisted of a dense
configuration of approximately 75-125 burned and fractured cobbles of limestone (90 percent) and sandstone (10
percent), ranging from 4 to 14 cm (average 8 cm). No carbon stains or charcoal flecks were observed. Five chert
tertiary flakes, one limestone unifacially worked flake, and one piece of quartzite shatter were noted within the
feature.
Feature 9 was a 1.4 x 1.2 x 0.1 m, roughly circular burned rock concentration located in the northwestern portion
of the site at the junction of a bladed northwest/southeast-trending road (TX-83) and a bladed north/south-trending
road. The feature had been truncated by the blading and eroded with a major rill cutting into the western portion.
The erosion had exposed approximately 0.1 m of subsurface carbon stains. It consisted of approximately 35 pieces
of burned limestone and sandstone ranging from 4-10 cm. Sparse charcoal flecks were observed. Several small
roots are present in the eroded portion of the feature. No artifacts were within the feature or in the vicinity. It is
likely that Feature 9 was a small roasting pit similar to many others documented at the site.
Feature 10 consisted of two rock rings forming a figure 8. The first was a roughly circular 4.3 x 4.0 m ring located
in the northwestern portion of the site, approximately 2 m north of the bladed pipeline road (TX-83). It consisted
of approximately 40 limestone and sandstone cobbles ranging between 20 and 35 cm in diameter. Sparse
vegetation and sand had accumulated in the center of the ring. No stains were observed; however, the feature was
resting on dark, cultural sediment. Several cobbles were located outside the ring and may have been part of the
feature at one time. Eight pieces of burned limestone were located to the south and upslope of Feature 10. A
smaller, 2.5 x 2 m, roughly circular ring of approximately 12 limestone and sandstone cobbles was adjacent and
directly north. It was unclear if the smaller ring was cultural or natural. One piece of chert shatter and two pieces
of limestone shatter were located 1 m upslope to the east. Function of the feature was known.
Feature 11 was a 9 x 0.5 m, roughly oval concentration of burned rock eroding from the eastern cut bank of the
northwest/southeast-trending road (TX-83). It consisted of 27 burned limestone and sandstone pieces ranging from
5 to 12 m. Feature 11 was eroding from the dark, cultural sediment and was adjacent to and east of Feature 10. No
distinct carbon stains or artifacts were observed in direct association with the feature. Feature 11 was likely a
small roasting pit similar to other features documented on the site.
Feature 12 was a roughly circular 1.5 x 1.4 m burned rock concentration located approximately 14 m west of the
north/south-trending road (TX-83B) in the south-central portion of the site. The feature was eroding from dark,
cultural sediment on a southwest-trending slope and had several rills running through it. Feature 12 consisted of
35 burned and fractured limestone cobbles ranging from 4 to 15 cm. No carbon stains or artifacts were identified
in the feature.

Feature 13 was a roughly oval 0.5 x 0.4 m concentration of burned rocks located approximately 0.25 m west of the
north/south-trending road (TX-83B). It consisted of 14 pieces of burned and fractured limestone ranging from 3 to
12 cm. The feature was partially buried in the dark, cultural sediment and partially covered by more recent eolian
sand. No carbon stains or artifacts were observed in direct association. Feature 13 was likely a roasting pit.
Feature 14 was a roughly oval 5 x 3 m burned rock concentration located approximately 2.5 m west of the
north/south-trending road (TX-83B) in the south-central portion of the site. It was deflated and eroding from dark,
cultural sediment on a southwest-trending slope. A large gully cut across the western portion of the feature.
Feature 14 consisted of a somewhat dense configuration of approximately 100 pieces of burned limestone ranging
from 2 to 12 cm. It was partially buried in the dark, cultural sediment; however, no carbon stains were observed
within the rocks. Artifacts observed within the feature included two limestone cores, one quartzite secondary
flake, approximately 10 chert tertiary flakes, and one chert unifacially worked flake. Feature 14 appeared to be a
deflated and eroded roasting pit.
Feature 15 was an amorphous, 0.8 x 0.6 m burned rock concentration located approximately 1.2 m north of Feature
14 and 3.2 m west of the north/south-trending road (TX-83B). It was composed of approximately 15 burned
limestone cobbles ranging from 7 to 14 cm. The feature had been partially buried by eolian sand, and no carbon
stains were observed. One secondary limestone flake and one chert biface thinning flake were within the feature.
Feature 15 was probably a buried roasting pit; however, it was possible that Feature 15 and Feature 14 were
exposed portions of the same feature.
Feature 16 was a 1.6 m diameter burned rock concentration located approximately 3 m west of the north/southtrending road (TX-83B) on a southwest-facing slope. The feature consisted of approximately 50 pieces of burned
and fractured limestone and sandstone pieces ranging from 3 to 11 cm. It was within the dark, cultural sediment;
however, no carbon stains were observed. The feature was deflated, and the western portion was dispersed and
extended an additional 3 m downslope. One limestone core, one chert secondary flake, and five chert tertiary
flakes were observed.
Feature 17 was an amorphous 5.7 x 5.6 m burned rock concentration located at the southern end of the rocky
outcrop, in the southern portion of the site. It was approximately 1 m east of the north/south-trending road (TX83B). The feature was resting on both bedrock and on small portions of the dark, cultural sediment. It was
deflated, eroded, and dispersed and consisted of approximately 150 burned and fractured limestone (90 percent)
and sandstone (10 percent) pieces. The burned pieces ranged from 3 to 12 cm (average 8 cm). No dark carbon
stains or charcoal flecks were observed. Artifacts located within the feature included two limestone cores, two
pieces of chert shatter, one limestone secondary flake, and three chert tertiary flakes. One chert secondary utilized
flake and one piece of ground sandstone were also noted. Feature 17 was located approximately 4 m south of
Feature 26 which was very similar in appearance.
Feature 18 consisted of two light carbon stains and several pieces of burned rock in a 0.7 x 0.3 m area. The
northern stain measured 18 x 8 cm, and the southern stain was 16 x 12 cm. A chert core was located
approximately 8 cm north of the northern stain. The feature was located in the bladed road (TX-83B) in an area
that was roughly 60 cm below mgs. Some burned rock and alluvial gravel were located adjacent to (<10 cm) and
south of the southernmost stain. It was unclear if the rock placement was the result of alluvial movement or if the
rock had been exposed in the rill. A trowel test trench was excavated across the eastern half of the two stains of
mottled, carbon-stained silt and the area between to determine if they retained any integrity. Fill between the two
stains was light tan silt. Two pieces of rock were exposed in the northern stain at 1 cm below the bladed surface,
and some charcoal flecks were observed. The stains and rock likely had been either redeposited or had

experienced severe erosion and blading, and retained no integrity.
Feature 19 was a 1.0 x 0.8 m amorphous carbon stain located at the northwestern boundary of the site near the
junction of a bladed northwest/southeast-trending road and a bladed north/south-trending road (both TX-83B). It
was situated approximately 0.9 m from the cut bank of the bladed roads and approximately 10 m southwest of
Feature 9. The feature consisted of six pieces of burned rock in a dark carbon stain with sparse charcoal flecks.
Features 9 and 19 were located in dark, cultural sediment. No artifacts were within the feature or in the vicinity.
Feature 19 was probably a truncated roasting pit, though it could be a concentration of stained sediment associated
with the dark, cultural sediment.
Feature 20 was a 3.8 x 2.1 m concentration of burned rocks located toward the northern portion of the site,
adjacent to and northeast of a bulldozer push pile and approximately 10 m southwest of the rocky outcrop. The
feature consisted of approximately 75-100 burned and fractured limestone (90 percent) and sandstone (10 percent)
pieces ranging from 2 to 14 cm (average 8 cm). The feature was deflated, and the burned rock was dispersed and
eroding down a south-trending slope. It was within the dark, cultural sediment. No dark carbon stains or charcoal
flecks were observed. Two tertiary limestone flakes were in the feature.
Feature 21 was a roughly circular, 1.6 x 1.5 m burned rock concentration located at the southern end of the site on
a slight, southeast-trending slope. It was a tight configuration of approximately 30 burned limestone pieces
ranging from 7 to 15 cm. No carbon stains or artifacts were observed in direct association with the feature. A 60 x
40 cm scatter of burned limestone, located approximately 30 cm to the northwest, was likely the result of a single
discard episode. Feature 21 was probably a roasting pit.
Feature 22 was a roughly circular, 2.3 x 2.3 m burned rock concentration located at the southern end of the site on
a slight, southeast-trending slope. It was deflated and eroding from the slope. Feature 21 was located
approximately 4 m to the northeast. No carbon stains were observed in direct association with the feature, which
was a dispersed configuration of approximately 30 pieces of burned and fractured limestone ranging from 5 to 13
cm. One piece of chert shatter was observed within the feature. A dense concentration of debitage, including six
chert tertiary flakes, one mudstone tertiary flake, two pieces of chert shatter, and two limestone tertiary flakes, was
located approximately 50 cm to the southwest. Feature 22 was likely a deflated roasting pit.
Feature 23 was a set of two bedrock mortars located in the northeastern portion of the site on top of the rocky
outcrop. The mortars were on a large, 3 x 2.1 m sandstone boulder just south of a high point on the outcrop. They
were oriented on a northwest/southeast axis. The western mortar measured 0.18 x 0.15 x 0.08 m; the eastern
measured 0.16 x 0.15 x 0.05 m. No artifacts were located on top of the boulder, though artifacts were present
within the vicinity. The western mortar was slightly eroded, with only a small portion (45 percent) of the smooth
interior surface remaining. This locale offered a good view of most of the site.
Feature 24 was a roughly oval, 3.1 x 2.8 m burned rock concentration located toward the southern end of the site
on a slight, southeast-trending slope. Feature 24 was deflated and dispersed and rested on sandstone bedrock. No
carbon stains were present. The feature was composed of approximately 50 burned and fractured limestone
cobbles ranging from 8 to 10 cm. No artifacts were observed in direct association with the feature. Feature 24 was
probably the remains of a roasting pit that had deflated to bedrock.
Feature 25 was an amorphous, 5.6 x 5 m burned rock concentration located approximately 2 m east of the
north/south-trending road (TX-83B) in the southern portion of the site. The feature was southwest of the rocky
outcrop on a southwest-trending slope. The feature was deflated and had eroded downslope. The northeastern
portion of the feature rested on sandstone bedrock, and the remainder rested on the dark, cultural sediment. It

consisted of approximately 100-125 burned and fractured limestone and sandstone cobbles ranging from 3 to 18
cm. No dark carbon stains or charcoal flecks were observed. One piece of chert shatter and one quartzite
secondary flake were located within the rock mass.
Feature 26 was an amorphous, 6.7 x 6.6 m burned rock concentration located on the southern terminus of the rocky
outcrop in the southern portion of the site. The feature was deflated, and the burned rock was dispersed on top of
the sandstone bedrock. A small portion (approximately 1 x 1 m) of the southwestern end of the feature was resting
on the dark, cultural sediment. The feature consisted of approximately 125 to 150 burned and fractured limestone
(90 percent) and sandstone (10 percent) pieces. They ranged from 4 to 10 cm (average 05 cm). No carbon stains
or charcoal flecks were observed. One limestone core, three limestone tertiary flakes, and one limestone Stage II
biface were located within the feature.
Feature 27 was a roughly circular, 1.2 x 1.1 m burned rock concentration located on the southern terminus of the
rocky outcrop in the southern portion of the site. It was approximately 3 m northeast of the north/south road (TX83B). The feature was resting on both the dark, cultural sediment and bedrock, and was partially buried by recent
eolian sand. It consisted of 30 burned and fractured limestone (90 percent) and sandstone (10 percent) pieces
ranging from 4 to 10 cm (average 7 cm). The burned rock was tightly clustered. No carbon stains or charcoal
flecks were observed. No artifacts were located within the feature, but a dense concentration of debitage and tools
was adjacent and extended up to 3 m north of the feature. It included two limestone cores, 10 to 15 limestone and
chert flakes, one projectile point, and one sandstone bifacially utilized mano.
Feature 28 was a burned rock concentration adjacent to the bladed north/south-trending road (TX-83B), 12 m south
of Feature 1. It measured 1.3 x 1.2 m. The feature appeared to be eroding from the cut bank. The eastern edge
had been damaged by previous blading, and some of the rock on the cut bank may have been mechanically pushed
there from Feature 1. No charcoal was evident, though the rock appeared to be in the darker cultural sediment.
The burned rock concentration was a 35 x 25 m area of burned and fragmented rock located in the southwestern
portion of the site. Burned rock was eroding from rills and gullies and moving downslope to the southwest. There
were 500+ limestone (85 percent) and sandstone (15 percent) cobbles that ranged from 2 to 15 cm (8 cm average);
however, no distinct areas of carbon stains or charcoal flecks were observed. It was unknown how many parent
features produced the discarded material. Hundreds of artifacts were present within this area.
Condition: The site has been crossed by several pipeline corridors and telecommunication ROWs; however,
because of the large size of the site, it remains in good condition.
Significance and National Register Eligibility: Site 41CU648 retains integrity and has been previously determined
eligible (P. Smith to C. Wheeler, fax transmission, 2 October 2001, BLM, Las Cruces, New Mexico). Subsurface
features are evident in the road cuts. The carbon-stained sediment within many of the thermal features could
address chronometric research domains. Intact deposits within feature fill could also address paleoenvironmental
research domains. It is recommended that 41CU648 remain eligible for the NRHP under criterion (d).

Discussion of Site
Site 41CU649 was a multicomponent site with a Late Archaic, Hueco phase roasting locale, a prehistoric artifact
scatter, a debitage concentration, a late Paleoindian/transitional Archaic projectile point, and a historic trash scatter
and concentration. The site was first documented during the resurvey for the AT&T NexGen/Core Project (Kearns
et al. 2003). The site was excavated during the treatment phase of the AT&T project, and the following
description was summarized from Jones (2009). The site measured 83 x 43 m, with an arbitrary boundary on the
southeastern edge. The site area was not determined because the site extends a considerable distance southeast of
the ROW. The site was located on land administered by Guadalupe Mountains National Park and was south of the
Guadalupe Mountains and west of the Delaware Mountains in an area of rocky hills and basins. It was on a southtrending slope in a basin between two hills. Shallow, braided washes dissected the basin, and intermittent
drainages bordered the western and southwestern margins of the site and crossed the central portion of the site.
Vegetation was dominated by creosote bush with mesquite, soaptree yucca, and various grasses.
Subsurface investigations revealed a single stratum with a maximum observed depth of 28 cm. The sediment was
light yellowish brown to yellowish brown (10YR 6/4-5/4), loose to moderately consolidated clay loam with
moderate pediment development. Discontinuous patches of Stage II carbonate development were noted within the
stratum, and the sediment had been disturbed by roots and insects. All recovered artifacts were either from the
modern ground surface or from full-cut contexts within Stratum I.
Five features were recorded on this site (Kearns et al. 2003). Two hearths (Features 1and 2) were excavated during
the treatment phase of the project (Jones 2009).
Three other features and prehistoric and historic artifact concentrations were located well outside the ROW and
were not investigated (Jones 2009). The prehistoric artifact concentration was described during the initial
inventory as a light scatter of flakes dominated by high-quality, fine-grained chert with some limestone and
quartzite. Features 3 and 4 were hearths, and Feature 5 was noted but not documented. Based on the presence of
burned rock, Feature 4 might be another roasting locale. The historic artifact scatter noted southeast of the ROW
during inventory included hole-in-cap cans and hinged-lid tobacco tins dating between 1920 and 1950. This trash
might be associated with travel along the historic, paved El PasoâCarlsbad Highway, a section of which is
approximately 150 m east of the ROW.
Treatment investigations began with a surface collection in the ROW that resulted in the recovery of 23 pieces of

debitage and seven flaked stone tools. Although no further investigation of the historic component was initially
recommended (Kearns et al. 2001a), nondiagnostic automobile glass, a tobacco tin, and an unidentified can were
noted within the ROW during the surface collection. Two activity areas were defined as a result of the
investigations.
Activity Area 1 was a 25.0 x 23.5 m area that contained a roasting locale with two features. Fifteen pieces of
debitage, two flaked stone tools, one late Paleoindian/transitional Archaic Golondrina projectile point, and 214
pieces of burned rock were recovered. The artifact assemblage reflected production of expedient flake tools that
were probably associated with the processing of vegetal resources. Manufacture and retouch of formal tools was
also indicated. The projectile point might reflect limited use of the area within the late Paleoindian/transitional
Archaic time frame.
Feature 1 was a rock-filled, basin-shaped hearth or roasting pit with an irregular shape. The feature measured 1.05
x 0.75 x 0.18 m. Feature fill was unconsolidated, grayish brown (10YR 5/2), carbon-stained clay loam with flecks
and small pieces of charcoal that occurred in patches beneath the burned rocks. Approximately 44 burned rocks
(5.8 kg) were removed from the hearth. The rocks were locally occurring sandstone and quartzite that ranged in
size from 5 to 17 cm. Charcoal from the feature excavation was identified as oak (Quercus sp.) and indeterminate
wood. Additional charcoal from the excavation block was identified as mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa). Oak and
mesquite most likely served as fuel for the hearth. Oak charcoal was submitted for radiocarbon analysis and
returned a 2-sigma date range of A.D. 150-390.
Feature 2 was a 0.55 x 0.30 x 0.07 m, oval, rock-filled, basin-shaped hearth. Slope wash had truncated the
northeastern third of the feature and mixed the feature fill with noncultural sediment. The peripheral feature fill
was pale brown (10YR 6/3), carbon-stained, clay loam of mixed sediment. The primary feature fill remained only
in the center of the feature and consisted of much darker, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam with many charcoal
flecks. Stratum I sediment beneath the feature fill was brighter yellow and harder than that surrounding the
feature, indicating that it had been thermally altered. Feature 2 contained more than 25 rocks that ranged in size
from 3 to 14 cm and weighed more than 7 kg. It had likely contained more burned rock prior to truncation.
Charcoal from Feature 2 was identified as mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), and indeterminate wood charcoal. The
mesquite was most likely used as fuel for the hearth; it was submitted for radiocarbon dating and returned a 2sigma date range of A.D. 110-330.
Activity Area 2 was a spatially discrete scatter of artifacts and burned stone in the northern portion of the ROW.
The scatter measured 12.5 x 11.0 m and included 11 pieces of debitage, two cores, two flake tools, and 285 pieces
of burned rock. The artifacts and burned rocks probably represented a disturbed roasting locale. The debitage
assemblage included shatter of limestone and quartzite, secondary flakes of chert and quartzite, and tertiary flakes
of chert and quartzite. The cores were of locally available quartzite; cores and debitage of local material types
reflect core reduction associated with the production of expedient flake tools. The flake tools from Activity Area 2
included a chert flake that had been utilized for cutting and a quartzite scraper. These tools probably reflect the
processing of vegetal material for roasting.
Twenty-six pieces of debitage were recovered from 41CU649, including six pieces of shatter, 10 secondary flakes,
and 10 tertiary flakes. Raw material types included limestone, chert, quartzite, and sandstone. The quartzite was
likely obtained from one or both of two nearby quarry sites (41CU652 and 41CU654), limestone outcrops were
ubiquitous in this portion of the project area, and sandstone benches outcrop on the nearby hills. Chert, however,
was not available in the immediate vicinity, and the nearest potential sources are the outcrops and pediment gravel
of Guadalupe Ridge (several kilometers to the northwest) and the Diablo Plateau, which begins approximately 30
km to the southwest.

Seven tools were recovered, including two cores, one late Paleoindian/transitional Archaic Golondrina projectile
point, one tabular knife, one scraper, one cutting tool, and one multifunctional scraper/cutting tool. Material types
include local limestone and quartzite, and chert that is not from the vicinity of the site.
The projectile point was a late Paleoindian Plainview or, more likely, a late Paleoindian/ transitional Archaic
Golondrina point and might reflect a late Paleoindian/transitional Archaic occupation. The characteristics of these
points overlap somewhat, and this specimen can be classified as both types based on Kelly's (1982) scheme. The
date ranges for both point types fall within the Plano tradition in the Trans-Pecos region circa 8000-6000 B.C.
(Miller and Kenmotsu 2004).
The flaked stone assemblage from 41CU649 reflected a range of potential activities. Expedient scraping and
cutting tools are consistent with those for processing vegetal resources; the tool forms are similar to those from
limited activity roasting locales in the AT&T project area, including New Mexico sites LA 130721, LA 130729,
and LA 132529 (Jones et al. 2010), and the tabular knife was similar to purported mescal knives. The projectile
point suggested additional activities. If the projectile point was not scavenged or collected by Late Archaic
occupants, it might reflect implement repair or hunting during a late Paleoindian/transitional Archaic occupation.
Treatment Recommendations: The AT&T ROW crossed the site north/south for 62 m. GMNP personnel required
that all earth-disturbing activities on the site be monitored.
Treatment Results: All construction activities were monitored and no cultural material was encountered.
Construction was completed without incident.
Condition: The site had been impacted by erosion from numerous washes, cattle grazing, rodent burrowing, and
previous construction within the ROW; it was in fair condition.
Significance and National Register Eligibility: Site 41CU649 was previously determined eligible for the NRHP
under criterion (d) (P. Smith to C. Wheeler, fax transmission, 2 October 2001, BLM, Las Cruces, New Mexico).
The site contains three unexcavated features and the prehistoric artifact concentration outside the ROW; all remain
in good condition. The features might provide macrobotanical and radiocarbon samples that would lead to a better
understanding of the chronology and possibly episodic use of roasting locales and could yield evidence of a late
Paleoindian occupation. The historic component contains an uninvestigated historic trash scatter. The scatter is
outside the ROW and is in good condition; it has the potential to provide data regarding use patterns of the historic,
paved El PasoâCarlsbad Highway, a regionally important historic travel route. Consequently, archaeological
research potential has not been exhausted, and it is recommended that the site remain eligible for the NRHP under
criterion (d). Site 41CU649 may also be eligible for the NRHP under criterion (a).

Discussion of Site
Site 41CU651 was located in the vicinity of Guadalupe Pass and consisted of three segments (Loci 1, 2, and 3) of
the Southern Route of the Butterfield Overland Mail (Butterfield Trail). Only Locus 3 was impacted during the
current undertaking. Locus 3 was identified during the resurvey of the AT&T NexGen/Core Project (Kearns et al.
2003). The locus was investigated during the treatment phase of the project, and the following description was
summarized from Jones (2009), the treatment report for the AT&T NexGen/Core Project. Locus 3 was discovered
because of presence of The Pinery (41CU193), a stage stop that was listed on the NRHP in 1974. The station was
located near Pine Springs in GMNP near the AT&T ROW. Locus 3 was discovered a few hundred yards east of
the station, beyond and to the east of the GMNP housing area. Vegetation in the area was predominantly creosote
bush, snakeweed, several yucca species, and various range grasses.
The main portion of the trail extended eastward from the ROW on the high ground between Cottonwood and
Cherry canyons toward Independence Spring, an important water stop on the Butterfield Trail. This seemed to be
the easiest, most expeditious route from Independence Spring to The Pinery. The two-track road on this route
measured approximately 8 to 10 ft and exhibited no evidence of blading or surface preparation. The route west of
the ROW had been obliterated during construction of housing and maintenance areas for GMNP.
Treatment Recommendations: The ROW crossed the site northeast/southwest for 10 ft. In addition, GMNP
personnel requested that the AT&T ROW be temporarily fenced for 100 ft from each side of the trail. Initially,
GMNP personnel required monitoring of all earth-disturbing activities and crossings of the site by heavy
equipment. Backhoes and pickups could cross without a monitor. After the initial construction blading, GMNP
personnel agreed that further monitoring was unnecessary.
Treatment Results: The site was temporarily fenced for the duration of construction. Initial construction blading
of the ROW was monitored. No cultural material was encountered, and construction was completed without
incident.
Condition: The portion of 41CU651âLocus 3 in the vicinity of the AT&T ROW was in poor condition in the
ROW. East of the ROW, the route was in good condition; west of the ROW (in the direction of The Pinery) the
route had generally been obliterated by construction.
Significance and National Register Eligibility: Site 41CU651 was previously determined eligible for the NRHP
under criterion (d) (P. Smith to C. Wheeler, fax transmission, 2 October 2001, BLM, Las Cruces, New Mexico).

Discussion of Site
Site 41CU660 was a multicomponent site with an Archaic residential component, transitional Late Archaic to early
Formative period roasting locales, Mogollon roasting locales, an abandoned segment of the historic, paved El
PasoâCarlsbad Highway (41CU661), and a historic artifact scatter. The site was originally recorded by ASLM
(Martin and Knight 2000). The site form was updated by WCRM during the damage assessment and subsequent
resurvey of the AT&T NexGen/Core Project (Kearns and Berrigan 2001; Kearns et al. 2003). Portions of the site
were excavated, and the following description was summarized from Jones (2009), the treatment report for the
AT&T NexGen/Core Project. The site was located on private land in an area of rolling hills and small valleys
south of the Guadalupe Mountains, east of Salt Flat, and west of Brushy Mesa and the Delaware Mountains along
Guadalupe Arroyo. It was situated in stabilized coppice dunes, interspersed with blowouts, on a broad terrace
along the southern margin of Guadalupe Arroyo. Sediment was eolian silt loam. Vegetation was dominated by
creosote bush and honey mesquite. Four-wing saltbush, soaptree yucca, tarbush, prickly pear cactus, and various
grasses were also present.
WCRM personnel described the site as an extensive scatter of burned rock, debitage, flaked stone tools, ground
stone milling equipment, and occasional sherds (Kearns and Berrigan 2001; Kearns et al. 2003). El Paso Brown,
Jornada Brown, and El Paso Polychrome sherds indicated a Formative period component with a Jornada Mogollon
cultural affiliation. The entire site was not recorded; the site extended at least 250 m between the southern terrace
of Guadalupe Arroyo and the southernmost feature and 320 m between the westernmost feature and State Route 54
to the east. Cultural material was identified north of Guadalupe Arroyo, and the site boundary was extended 495 m
to the north. Thirty-six burned rock features (Features 1-36) occasionally associated with black, charcoal-stained

sediment were noted in the recorded area. A 75 x 55 m area of dense cultural debris and dark, carbon-stained
sediment resembling a midden deposit was also noted in the central portion of the site.
Excavation at 41CU660 both inside and outside the ROW resulted in identification of a sitewide stratigraphic
sequence, identification of 10 study units, and exploration of 48 features and subfeatures (Jones 2009). In addition
to the features identified on the ground surface within the ROW during the original survey, subsurface
investigations exposed 37 additional features and four subfeatures. Twenty-eight features that were previously
identified (Features 1, 2, 5, 6, 8-11, 16-32, 34-36) were not investigated. Feature 13 was noncultural, as were
newly assigned Features 56, 60, and 70. Feature 58 was not an assigned number.
Subsurface investigations resulted in identification of four strata, including two that occurred across the site.
Stratum I was pale brown (10YR 6/3), loose sandy loam. Stratum II was slightly compacted pale brown (10YR
6/3), sandy loam. In Block 1Stratum I ranged from 1 to 34 cm thick. Stratum II had a maximum thickness of 17
cm. Two additional strata were observed in Block 4. Stratum III was slightly darker, compacted, grayish brown
(10YR 5/2) sandy loam. Stratum IV was very well compacted, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4,) sandy loam with
calcium carbonate nodules. Strata I-III were eolian in origin, and Stratum I had recently eroded from the
underlying sediment and been redeposited. The origin of the Stratum IV sediment could not be determined.
Cultural material was present in Strata I-III.
Ten study units were defined as a result of the investigations and data analyses. These included in Block 1 a
Middle Archaic Camp Locale, a Late Archaic Occupation, two roasting locales (Roasting Locales 1 and 2), a
Hearth-centered Activity Area, and a set of Uncorrelated Features. A Historic study unit was located in Blocks 1
and 4. An additional roasting locale (Roasting Locale 3) was investigated with Block 2. The Midden Deposit in
the central portion of the site was investigated with Blocks 3-7. The remaining investigations were assigned to a
GSA study unit.
Investigations in the Middle Archaic Camp Locale resulted in the excavation of three hearths (Features 66, 67, and
68) and six postholes (Features 40, 59, 69, 71, 75, and 77). Radiocarbon assays from Features 66-68 returned 2sigma date ranges of 3340 to 3210 B.C. and 3190 to 2920 B.C., 3350 to 3020 B.C., and 3350 to 2920 B.C.,
respectively. These dates are similar and indicate use within the Middle Archaic period. Features 66-68 (hearths)
and Features 69, 71, and 77 (postholes) all had identical points of origin and were likely associated. The tops of
Features 40 and 59 were probably smeared and were not identified until slightly lower. Although Feature 75
(posthole) was first identified below the other features, it was probably associated based on the posthole
configuration. The construction of the pit structure (Feature 3) probably removed the top of Feature 75. The
postholes were probably the remains of a brush structure or ramada.
Investigations in the Late Archaic Occupation resulted in the excavation of one pit structure (Features 3), one
central hearth (Feature 3.1), one warming pit (Feature 3.3), one posthole (Feature 3.6), one entryway (Feature 3.7),
and one extramural hearth (Feature 63). Radiocarbon assays from Features 3.1, 3.3, and 63 returned 2-sigma date
ranges of 1300 to 1030 B.C., 1270 to 1000 B.C., and 1280 to 1010 B.C., respectively. These ranges significantly
overlapped and placed the use of the area in the early portion of the Late Archaic Hueco phase.
ï¿½
Investigations in Roasting Locale 1 resulted in the excavation of three roasting pits (Features 47, 48, and 76), one
burned rock discard pile (Feature 72), and an indeterminate thermal feature (Feature 50). A radiocarbon assay
from Feature 76 returned a 2-sigma date range of 50 B.C.-A.D. 100, placing use of the feature within the Late
Archaic period, though postdating the occupation of the Late Archaic pit structure and associated features (see
above). The proximity and similar point of origin of the features as well as a radiocarbon assay date range indicate
an association.

artifact assemblage from the study unit consisted of one unidentifiable quartzite metate fragment recovered from
Feature 54, and one quartzite tertiary flake recovered from Feature 55. The calibrated 2-sigma date ranges from
Feature 55 were A.D. 260 to 300 and A.D. 310 to 430. This placed the use of the feature in the transitional Late
Archaic/early Formative periods. The dates were essentially the same as those from the Hearth-centered Activity
Area. It is possible that both study units were "family" hearth and roasting locales occupied at the same time.
Activities in Roasting Locale 2 were most likely associated with the cooking of presumably locally acquired
foodstuffs.
Investigations in the Hearth-centered Activity Area resulted in the excavation of six hearths (Features 37, 41, 43,
44, 45, and 46), one roasting pit (Feature 42), one burned rock discard pile (Feature 4), and one indeterminate
feature (Feature 61). The points of origin of the features were similar and they were likely associated.
Radiocarbon dates from four hearths and one roasting pit indicate use of the activity area between A.D. 250 and
580. This places the use of the Hearth-centered Activity Area in the transitional Late Archaic/early Formative
period.
Investigations in the Uncorrelated Features study unit resulted in the excavation of two hearths (Features 62 and
64), a roasting pit (Feature 73), an indeterminate thermal feature (Feature 51), and two postholes (Features 65 and
74). These six features could not be correlated with any of the other temporal components, and no datable material
was recovered. It was unclear if these features were associated with any of the other features identified within
Block 1.
The Historic study unit consisted of debris associated with the historic, paved El PasoâCarlsbad Highway
(41CU661), a historic fence post (Feature 57), and 848 historic artifacts. Historic artifacts were found throughout
all strata, with the majority in Stratum II. Other than the excavation of Feature 57, the historic component of the
site was not formally investigated.
Investigations in Roasting Locale 3 resulted in the excavation of one roasting pit (Feature 7) and one hearth
(Feature 49). Features 7 and 49 were probably contemporaneous, based on their vertical and horizontal proximity.
One radiocarbon assay from Feature 7 returned a 2-sigma date range of 40 B.C.-A.D. 130, placing the use of the
feature during the Late Archaic period. The radiocarbon assay date range from Feature 7 was almost identical to
the date range returned from Feature 76, a similar roasting pit identified in Roasting Locale 2 approximately 8.5 m
to the southeast. Features in both study units may have been contemporaneous and associated.
Investigations in the Midden Deposit resulted in the excavation of five redeposited cultural features (Features 12,
14, 33, 38, and 39) and subsurface explorations at five locales (Blocks 3-7). A grouping of five burned rock and
artifact concentrations (Features 25-29) was identified within the Midden Deposit and outside the ROW to the
east. A radiocarbon assay from Feature 38 returned a date range of A.D. 690-900, which placed use or occupation
of the area in the Mesilla phase of the Jornada Mogollon sequence. Activities associated with the midden possibly
included manufacture and maintenance of lithic tools, processing and roasting of local vegetative matter, and
cooking of small mammals. Because the portion of the midden in the ROW was disturbed, it is unclear whether
these activities occurred within the midden proper or within the general area.
Investigations in the GSA resulted in the excavation of one feature (Feature 15) consisting of redeposited cultural
material. No datable material was recovered from the block, because it had been thoroughly disturbed and
sediment was believed to be in secondary context.

Site 41CU660 yielded 4,568 artifacts. These included 3,536 lithic artifacts, 63 ceramics, 117 nonhuman bones,
four shell, and 848 historic artifacts. The lithic artifacts included 3,422 pieces of debitage, 63 flaked stone tools,
and 51 pieces of ground stone.
Debitage represented 97 percent (n = 3,422) of the total lithic assemblage. Sixty-one percent (n = 2,143) of the
debitage were tertiary flakes, 17 percent (n = 602) were secondary flakes, and 2 percent (n = 60) were primary
flakes.
The 63 flaked lithic tools included two pieces of assayed raw material, four cores, 15 utilized flakes, one piece of
retouched shatter, four pieces of retouched/utilized shatter, 11 retouched/utilized flakes, two choppers, two tabular
knives, two scraper planes, five scrapers, 10 bifaces, and five projectile points or fragments.
Of the five projectile points or point fragments recovered, two were fragments of the same tool. Combined, they
formed a large, corner-notched point within the range of the San Pedro style or possibly a variation on the
"Carlsbad Point" (Leslie 1978:133), or "Hueco" style (MacNeish 1993:182). One was a small, corner-notched
point resembling Leslie's (1978) Type 3A and/or a possible Scallorn variant (Suhm and Jelks 1962). The
manufacturing date of the style was within the Late Archaic period. Another was an indeterminate point fragment,
but the size indicated a Late Archaic or early Formative affiliation. Finally, one point was an indeterminate
fragment with no style or age category.
Fifty-one pieces of ground stone were recovered from the site. These included three shallow basin metates, two
indeterminate handstones, 14 indeterminate pieces of ground stone, 30 indeterminate metate fragments, one
lapstone, and one pecking stone.
Assayed raw material, cores, and all stages of core reduction flakes indicated that initial stages of tool manufacture,
as well as finishing stages and tool maintenance, were performed. Retouched and utilized flakes were used for
cutting, chopping, and/or scraping tasks. Formal scrapers, choppers, and knives were present on site. Projectile
points in the assemblage indicated that some reliance on hunting occurred during the occupation. The ground
stone indicated some reliance on vegetative processing for consumption. The absence of trough metates probably
indicates a greater reliance on hard seeds than corn.
The ceramic assemblage from 41CU660 included 63 ceramic artifacts, 19 of which were too small for analysis.
The remaining 44 were identified as Jornada Brown, El Paso Brown, and Chupadero Black-on-white. With the
exception of three Jornada Brown bowl fragments, all of the sherds were from jars. No evidence of use wear and
sherd reworking was identified. Examination of tempering material suggested that two of the Jornada Brown
sherds were from a vessel produced in the Sierra Blanca region, and the Chupadero Black-on-white sherds were
from a vessel produced in the Pueblo Colorado area of central New Mexico. The remaining sherds had tempering
material that was inconclusive of a specific source.
The faunal assemblage at 41CU660 contained 117 bone fragments representing a minimum of six individuals
including a small bird, a kangaroo rat, a wood rat, a squirrel, a jackrabbit, and a cottontail rabbit. The bird
material corresponds to several fragments of an eggshell. The squirrel specimen showed evidence of carnivore
gnawing and may be naturally deposited or transported material. Several of the small mammal fragments were
charred or calcined, suggesting that some portion of the assemblage, most likely the jackrabbit and/or hare, is of
cultural origin.
Four shell items were recovered from 41CU660 within Stratum II less than 20 cm below the ground surface. The
shells included two complete unmodified pond snails (Stagnicola sp.), one partial pond snail fragment, and one

possibly ornamental, unidentifiable fragment. The presence of pond snails reflected a moist environment. The
ornamental fragment was possibly a large circular disk.
One macrobotanical sample, one radiocarbon sample, and 21 flotation samples were collected from the site. The
samples were recovered from 11 hearths, five roasting pits, one warming pit, one indeterminate feature, and two
pockets of redistributed material. Fuel wood recovered from hearths was composed primarily of mesquite and
woody legume-type wood and saltbush-type wood. A few fragments of cholla-type wood, buckthorn-type wood,
and lotebush wood were also identified in the samples. No seeds, fruit fragments, or other edible plant fragments
were recovered from the samples. The better fuel types (mesquite and woody legume) were recovered from the
hearths with rock and from the roasting facilities; saltbush-type wood was recovered primarily from the hearths
lacking rocks.
Radiocarbon dates indicated that 41CU660 was occupied at least five times over a span of approximately 4,000
years. It was initially occupied during the Middle Archaic period between 3350 and 2920 B.C. Assays from three
hearths (Features 66, 67, and 68) all returned dates within this range. The six postholes suggested a brush structure
or ramada in association with these thermal features. Dates from two interior hearths (Features 3.1 and 3.3) of the
pit structure (Feature 3) between 1300 and 1000 B.C. indicated a Late Archaic occupation. An additional date
range from a hearth (Feature 63) associated with the pit structure also returned a similar date range (1280-1010
B.C.). Samples from two roasting pits (Features 7 and 76), located in Roasting Locale 1 and Roasting Locale 3,
respectively, also returned Late Archaic date ranges between 50 B.C. and 130 A.D. This was substantially later
than the pit structure. Assays from four hearths (Features 37, 43, 44, and 45) located in the Hearth-centered
Activity Area returned date ranges of A.D. 250 to 580. These placed the use of the area within the Late
Archaic/early Formative period. A single assay from a roasting pit (Feature 55) located in Roasting Locale 2
returned similar date range of A.D. 260-430. An assay from redeposited cultural material (Feature 38) located in
the Midden Deposit returned a date range of A.D. 690-900, placing use of the midden in the Mesilla phase of the
Formative period.
Chronometric material indicated that the site was occupied at least six times over approximately 4,000 years. The
data indicated that the subsistence strategy changed little over time, and evidence of extralocal interaction was
limited to ceramics. Ground stone indicated seed grinding, and though projectile points were found that indicated
hunting, the paucity of faunal evidence indicated that large game was not a subsistence resource. The site
apparently functioned as a camp locale during the Middle to Late Archaic and was used primarily for roasting
activities in later occupations.
Treatment Recommendations: The AT&T ROW crosses the site northeast/southwest for approximately 600 m.
Site 41CU660 was not originally slated for construction monitoring; however, during a spot check of construction
activity by an archaeological monitor, it was discovered that construction activities were taking place outside the
ROW within the site boundary. Gravel was being taken out of Guadalupe Arroyo (an intermittently activity
channel). No damage was done to the cultural resources of the site. It was recommended that additional work on
the site in the ROW be monitored. See Construction Incidents, this report.
Treatment Results: Following discovery of the violation, no further incidents occurred and no cultural discoveries
were made.
Condition: The site had been impacted by slope wash, cattle grazing, construction of the historic, paved El
PasoâCarlsbad Highway (41CU661), and previous construction within the AT&T ROW. The portion of the site
outside the ROW, however, was in good condition (Kearns et al. 2003).

Significance and National Register Eligibility: Site 41CU660 was previously determined eligible for the NRHP
under criterion (d) (P. Smith to C. Wheeler, fax transmission, 2 October 2001, BLM, Las Cruces, New Mexico).
The inhabitants of the site used pottery, carried on milling activities, and used stone tools for cutting, scraping,
chopping, and hunting tasks associated with food procurement and processing. The area excavated and
constructed through covered a very small percentage of the site, and there is considerable evidence that additional
subsurface cultural deposits exist outside the ROW. Therefore, archaeological research potential has not been
exhausted, and it is recommended that the site remain eligible for the NRHP under criterion (d).

Environmental/Topographical Setting
Site 41CU667 was located in Guadalupe Mountains National Park on the dissected pediment along the
southeastern flank of the Guadalupe Mountains. It was situated on the top and northeastern flank of a rolling,
rocky ridge south of Smith Canyon, approximately 0.6 km (0.3 mi) east-southeast of Choza Spring, and 1 km (0.6
mi) southeast of Nipple Hill. The terrain contained abundant limestone clasts in a silt loam matrix. A bedrock
outcrop of Permian age Cherry Canyon Formation limestone formed a low rise on the ridge crest. Vegetation on
the site was juniper, gray oak, mountain mahogany, soaptree yucca, Apache plume, barberry, cholla, prickly pear,
and miscellaneous grasses and annuals. Sotol and agave occurred in the vicinity.

Discussion of Site
Site 41CU667 was a lithic procurement locale of unknown prehistoric affiliation. The site was first recorded by
WCRM during the resurvey for the AT&T NexGen/Core Project (Kearns et al. 2003). The site was investigated
during the treatment phase of the project, and the following description was summarized from Jones (2009), the
treatment report for the AT&T NexGen/Core Project. The 100 x 65 m site was located in Guadalupe Mountains
National Park on the dissected pediment along the southeastern flank of the Guadalupe Mountains. It was situated
on the top and northeastern side of a rolling, rocky ridge south of Smith Canyon, approximately 0.6 km (0.4 mi)
east of Choza Spring and 1 km (0.6 mi) southeast of Nipple Hill. The terrain contained abundant limestone clasts
in a silt loam matrix. A bedrock outcrop of Permian age Cherry Canyon Formation limestone formed a low rise on
the ridge crest, which served as the source material for the lithic procurement locale. Vegetation on the site was
juniper, gray oak, mountain mahogany, soaptree yucca, Apache plume, barberry, cholla, prickly pear, and
miscellaneous grasses and annuals. Sotol and agave occurred in the vicinity. Site 41CU646, a multicomponent
historic refuse scatter and prehistoric camp and roasting locale, was approximately 40 m (131 ft) northeast of
41CU667.
Investigations at 41CU667 included in-field analysis of 67 lithic artifacts from outside the project ROW, and
collection of 114 lithic artifacts from the surface of the ROW. The site contained four areas of higher artifact
density (Loci 1-4) within a general scatter of debitage and cores. Delineation of the loci was approximate and was
affected by vegetative cover. Other loci may have been obscured by vegetation.
Locus 1 had the highest artifact density. It was an asymmetrical area that measured 23 x 20 m, was located in the
southwestern quadrant of the site, and was directly associated with the outcrop of cherty limestone along the ridge
crest. Approximately 50 m2 of Locus 1 were within the ROW, and the remainder of the locus was south of the
ROW. Locus 1 contained two areas where artifacts were clustered in spatially discrete concentrations.
Locus 2 was a roughly triangular area that measured 15 x 10 m; it was located on top of the ridge immediately
south of the ROW and approximately 1 to 5 m east of Locus 1. Locus 2 was a moderately dense artifact
concentration adjacent to the cherty limestone outcrop.
Locus 3 was immediately north of the ROW approximately 5 m north of Locus 1. This irregularly shaped 20 x 15
m locus was on the top and upper, north-facing slope of the ridge and contained a moderately dense lithic artifact
scatter.
Locus 4 was another irregularly shaped, moderately dense lithic artifact scatter that encompassed an area roughly
25 x 10 m. It was located along the southern edge of the ROW on the eastern slope of the ridge. Approximately
30 m2 of Locus 4 were within the ROW. Locus 4 contained three relatively discrete concentrations.
In addition to the four loci, a light scatter of cherty limestone and limestone artifacts was present across the site.

With few exceptions, artifacts represented exploitation of the local tool stone. One small, discrete artifact
concentration was present in the ROW outside the loci boundaries.
A sample of 67 lithic artifacts from outside the ROW was mapped and analyzed in the field. Most of the artifacts
(70.1 percent) were in Locus 1, with smaller proportions in Locus 2 (7.5 percent), Locus 3 (16.4 percent), Locus 4
(3.0 percent), and in the general site scatter (3.0 percent). Seventeen of the analyzed artifacts were cores or tools.
These included 10 multidirectional cores, one unidirectional core, one small chopper/scraper, one retouched flake,
one fragmented retouched flake or early stage biface, and three possible hammerstones. No temporally or
culturally diagnostic artifacts were noted. One of the cores was chert, and one of the retouched items was
quartzite. All of the other flakes and tools were manufactured from the locally available, dark gray, cherty
limestone or gray limestone. Typically, the cherty limestone artifacts were physically weathered and oxidized to a
reddish or tan color. The three possible hammerstones had been produced from subangular limestone cobbles that
were locally available in the surface detritus. This material was not cherty and was typically softer than the
material of the other artifacts. Although classified in the field as hammerstones, identification was based largely
on morphology and was unclear because of the weathered surfaces.
One hundred fourteen artifacts were recovered from the site surface within the ROW. These included 108 pieces
of debitage and six cores. Except for density, there were no distinctive differences in the distribution of artifact
types among the loci. The collected assemblage includes seven primary, 62 secondary, and 39 tertiary flakes in
proportions that are consistent with identification of the site as a lithic procurement locale. Six cores were
collected and included three unidirectional, one bifacial, one multidirectional, and one indeterminate form. None
of the cores appears to be patterned or purposely designed. The multidirectional core was indicative of
opportunistic reduction incorporating bifacial flake removal on opposite edges. The relatively high incidence of
flake debris vs. cores and other flaked implements indicates that the initial reduction of cores and core tools for use
elsewhere was a primary activity.
The predominant lithic material type on the site is fine-grained, but not cryptocrystalline, cherty limestone. All of
the artifacts recovered from the site exhibit some physical or chemical alteration to the flaked surfaces, a finding
that largely coincided with in-field analysis. In some instances, weathering is severe, and flake scars and other
artifact attributes are softened or obscured. In these cases, the flaked surface resembles a coarse-grained crust.
Because of weathering, use wear is not evident on the artifacts. Also, identification of primary, secondary, and
tertiary flakes is difficult because of severe weathering on the dorsal surfaces of many flakes. Weathering, in a
number of instances, obscures the difference between flake scars and unmodified cortex.
Treatment Recommendations: The ROW crossed the site northeast/southwest for 98 m. Personnel from GMNP
required monitoring of all earth-disturbing activities and heavy equipment crossings of the site. Backhoes and
pickups could cross without a monitor. During construction in the 1940s and 1980s, several large boulders had
been placed across the ROW and directly outside the ROW. Initially, the construction company requested to stack
the rocks in the ROW on top of the rocks outside the ROW. GMNP personnel agreed, with the stipulation that a
monitor be present. Ultimately, it was decided to remove the rock from outside the ROW off the site.
Treatment Results: All of the rock moving was monitored and completed without the construction equipment
leaving the ROW. Construction within the ROW was completed without incident and there were no cultural
discoveries.
Condition: The condition of the site outside the ROW was good.
Significance and National Register Eligibility: Site 41CU667 was previously determined eligible for the NRHP

under criterion (d) (P. Smith to C. Wheeler, fax transmission, 2 October 2001, BLM, Las Cruces, New Mexico).
Current investigations indicate that the portion of the site within the ROW has been heavily impacted by
construction of the AT&T A and B cables. Although the distribution of cultural material within the ROW has been
compromised by previous disturbance, the densest concentrations of artifacts in the ROW correspond to the
locations of Locus 1 and Locus 4 and may indicate that the artifacts were not significantly displaced. The artifact
assemblage from the ROW provided a sufficient sample to address current research concerns. As demonstrated,
significant cultural material is present outside the ROW. Therefore, archaeological research potential has not been
exhausted, and it is recommended that the site remain eligible for the NRHP under criterion (d)

Environmental/Topographical Setting
The site is a sparse lithic scatter with a thermal feature located approximately 0.3 km (0.2 mi) west of Guadalupe
Canyon and approximately 1.6 km (0.1 mi) west of an unnamed drainage that eventually feeds into Guadalupe
Arroyo to the southeast. The site is positioned just west of a large, rocky outcrop on a small flat composed of
shallow alluvium and recent eolian sediment. The flat is located between the Delaware Mountains to the southeast
and the southern tip of the Guadalupe Mountains to the north-northwest. U.S. Highway 62/180 is located west of
the site, and the end of the (canceled) AT&T reroute (Pole 2113) is located approximately 0.4 km (0.25 mi) south.
Vegetation consists of narrowleaf yucca, barberry, creosote bush, snakeweed, assorted grasses and forbs, mesquite,
and a single ocotillo.

Cultural Features
Feature 1 was a small hearth with thermally altered limestone and sandstone; it had ash stains and charcoal just
below the loose surface sediment. Based on its appearance, the hearth might be historic or modern in origin, but
this could not be determined within the project scope. Feature 2 contained burned rock and lithic artifacts. Feature
3 had only burned rock.

Discussion of Site
Site 41CU748 was a 92 x 79 m (302 x 259 ft) multicomponent historic trash dump and sparse prehistoric lithic
scatter containing three thermal features. The site was recorded in 2008 by WCRM for a potential reroute as part
of the AT&T NexGen/Core Project (Sullivan-Owens 2008); it was located roughly 305 m (1,000 ft) west of
Guadalupe Canyon and 21 m (69 ft) northeast of U.S. Highway 62/180. Site 41CU748 was situated on an alluvial
valley floor that drained into the larger Salt Flat Basin. Vegetation consisted of creosote bush, mesquite,
narrowleaf yucca, barberry, snakeweed, and assorted grasses and forbs.
Site 41CU748 was initially identified as a 19 x 16 m, sparse lithic scatter with one thermal feature of unknown
temporal and cultural affiliation and a historic or modern component (Sullivan-Owens 2008). The thermal feature
was documented as a small, thermally altered, limestone and sandstone hearth with ash stains and charcoal just
below the surface. The site was in fair condition and appeared to retain intact cultural deposits; however, both
natural and artificial forces had resulted in moderate impact to the site.
Treatment Recommendations: Site 41CU748 was located adjacent to U.S. Highway 62/180. A well-maintained,
bladed road through the site was the only viable exit from the highway where heavy equipment could be brought
from the highway on trucks and off-loaded, given the concerns of the landowner, terrain, and Texas Department of
Transportation. Access to 6,000 ft or more of ROW was controlled by this egress (TX-83) from the highway.
Based on the well constructed and maintained character of the existing road and its previous use for construction of
pipelines, telephone lines, and an existing fiber optic line, no additional impact would result to site 41CU748 if
travel was restricted to the existing road. Travel of heavy trucks and equipment on this road will be monitored to
ensure no impact to the site.
Treatment Results: Traffic using the road across the site was monitored and there were no impacts to the site.
During updating of the site prior to use of the I/E route, additional features were found and the site boundary
expanded.
Current investigations resulted in identification of two additional thermal features (Features 2 and 3). An
extensive historic trash dump, Concentration A, and widely scattered historic debris were also identified.
Feature 2 was a burned rock pile located roughly 30 m east-southeast of Feature 1 below an outcrop of large

boulders and adjacent to an intermittent drainage. It measured 5 x 3 m and consisted of approximately 75 large
rocks (average size 15 cm) exposed on the surface. Numerous small rock fragments were dispersed among the
larger rock. Associated artifacts included two orthoquartzite primary flakes and one limestone scraper plane.
Feature 3 (4 x 3 m) was located approximately 5 m south of Feature 2 and consisted of approximately 50 pieces of
burned rock (average size 15 cm) exposed on the surface. The burned rock was mostly limestone, but quartzite
and sandstone were also present. No artifacts were associated with Feature 3.
Concentration A was a sparse scatter of cans and glass throughout the central and eastern half of the site.
Concentration A was an approximately 79 x 59 ft (24 x 18 m) historic trash dump containing cans, bottle glass,
porcelain, Fiesta ware, white improved earthenware, and miscellaneous metal objects. Sanitary cans were the most
numerous items and included more than 100 specimens. Other metal objects included at least seven hole-in-cap
milk cans, two Log Cabin syrup cans, one church key-opened beverage can, one lard pail (or small paint can), three
coffee cans, two meat cans, at least three 1-quart oil cans, 27 crown caps, three external friction lids, one internal
friction lid, two threaded lids, three strands of baling wire (unknown length), two fence staples, one file fragment,
one razor blade, one aluminum lamp collar (inscribed WHITE FLAME LIGHT GRAND RAPIDS MICHIGAN),
one purse clasp, two metal battery cases, and one 12 gauge shotgun shell primer (PETERS/H.V./MADE IN
U.S.A./12). Bottle glass included one complete condiment bottle (Tabasco?), one fingernail polish bottle, 14 bottle
bases with makers' marks, at least six bottle finishes (threaded and crown cap), and numerous fragments of
colorless (n = >100), brown (n = >75), light green (n = >50), dark green (n = 2), and cobalt blue (n = 22) glass. Six
of the bottle bases were Coca-Cola bottles from El Paso, Texas (n = 5) and Deming, New Mexico (n = 1). Makers'
marks on the remaining bottle bases indicated manufacture dates between the 1920s and 1960s. Historic ceramics
included at least 70 fragments of china or porcelain, 15 fragments of orange-glazed and 16 fragments of blueglazed Fiesta ware, and at least 10 fragments of white improved earthenware. Some of the ceramic objects
contained floral decals over glaze, painted patterns under glaze, and embossed floral patterns. One lid fragment
from a serving dish or tea pot and half of a white improved earthenware cup were also identified. The artifacts in
Concentration A were mainly domestic with a small amount of automotive trash, probably from a nearby service
station.
Historic artifacts in the remaining portions of the site included a widely dispersed scatter of cans (mostly sanitary
cans but also hole-in-cap and 1-quart oil cans) and bottle glass, as well as a set of mattress springs. A jumble of
roughly 3-4 x 1 ft sandstone blocks, a metal pipeline cap, and barbed wire were located in the southeastern portion
of the site in what appeared to be a push pile along the edge of a bladed pipeline ROW. The shaped sandstone
blocks were probably originally associated with erosion control features or culverts along the historic, paved El
PasoâCarlsbad Highway (41CU661) and were redeposited during ROW construction.
Condition: Fair. Site appeared to retain intact cultural material.
Significance and National Register Eligibility: Site 41CU748 has been previously recommended eligible for the
NRHP under criterion (d) (Sullivan-Owen 2008). No eligibility determination has been made for the site,
however. The site appears to retain intact cultural deposits including two prehistoric features and one historic
dump. The prehistoric component could provide information about the hunter-gatherer lifestyle within the TransPecos region of Texas. The historic trash could provide additional insight into lifeways in rural west Texas during
the mid-twentieth century. Therefore, 41CU748 retains an eligible recommendation to the NRHP under criteria (a)
and (d).
