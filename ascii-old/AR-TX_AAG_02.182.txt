ABSTRACT
In February and March 2012, American Archaeology Group LLC conducted an
archaeological survey of a 21.66 acre tract for the City of Belton’s proposed South Belton
Wastewater Treatment Plant located adjacent to the Lampasas River. The investigation
consisted of a pedestrian survey supported with mechanical trenching. One prehistoric
archaeological site (41BL1360) was identified during the survey on the basis of
freshwater mussel shell being present. Two radiometric assays yielded dates for the
occupation from two zones. The first sample was recovered from 47 centimeters (1.69
meters below original surface) and the second from 97 centimeters (2.19 meters below the
original surface) below the current surface in order to at least obtain some chronometric
dates on the prehistoric occupation time periods at this site. The first sample (Beta Analytic
324052) obtained at 47 centimeters below the surface produced a Conventional
Radiocarbon age of 3240 +/- 30 BP [(Cal BC 1600 to 1570 (Cal BP 3560 to 3520) and Cal
BC 1560 to 1550 (Cal BP 3510 to 3500) and Cal BC 1540 to 1440 (Cal BP 3490 to 3390)].
The second sample (Beta Analytic 324053) obtained at 97 centimeters below the surface
produced a Conventional Radiocarbon age of 3140+/- 30 BP [Cal BC 1490 to 1480 (Cal BP
3440 to 3430) and Cal BC 1450 to 1380 (Cal BP 3400 to 3340) and Cal BC 1330 to 1320
(Cal BP 3280 to 3280)], thus dating this site minimally to the Middle Archaic time period
(2500 – 1000 BC). Approximately 10 percent of the site actually remains intact along the
southern boundary fence line and extends to the south where additional cultural deposits
are probably intact. The portion of site 41BL1360 located in the current project area is
not deemed to be eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
nor worthy of designation as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL). American
Archaeology Group LLC recommends that construction within the project area should
be allowed to proceed as planned without archaeological monitoring. No artifacts were
recovered; therefore, no curation was arranged.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Belton plans to construct a wastewater plant southeast of the City of Belton on
the west side of the Lampasas River, Bell County, Texas (Figure 1). The project area consisted of
approximately 21.66 acres for the project area. It is depicted on the Belton 7.5' U.S.G.S topographic
Zone 14 quadrangle map (Figure 2). The UTM coordinates for the approximate center of the tract
is Northing 3431005 and Easting 645288. The proposed impacts will be approximately 12 feet below
the surface with some piers reaching 16 feet. The project was funded by the City of Belton and was
conducted under the auspices of Texas Antiquities Permit Number 6165 in order to comport with
provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) in anticipation of review by the Texas Historical
Commission (THC). A research design and scope of work was submitted to the Texas Historical
Commission prior to implementing the project (Appendix I).

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
General
Bell County is located within the Balconian biotic province includes the Gulf coastal plain
from the Atlantic Ocean to eastern Texas. The size and location of this province is described below
by Blair (1950:112):
The Balconian province, as here defined, takes in most of the Edwards Plateau as
limited by Sellards, Adkins and Plummer (1933): (Figs. 3 and 4), the Lampasas Cut
Plain and Comanche Plateau of Raisz (1939 [cited as 1946 in Blair]), and the Central
Mineral or Llano Uplift region. That part of the Edwards Plateau lying west of the
Pecos, and often referred to as the Stockton Plateau, is not included, but is referred to
instead as the Chihuahuan province.
Climate
The Balconian climate is characterized by a decrease in rainfall from east to west. Bell
County is located in the eastern half of the province which has been classified by Thornwaite (1948)
as dry subhumid, mesothermal with average annual potential evapotranspiration of between 39.27
and 44.88 inches. The annual rainfall for Bell County is 34 inches, the January minimum
temperature is 37 degrees Fahrenheit, the July maximum temperature is 96 degrees Fahrenheit, and
the growing season is 258 days (Kingston and Harris 1983).
Soils
Two soil series were noted within the project area: Bosque clay loam (Be) and Bosque
clay loam, frequently flooded (Bf). These soils are deep alluvial soils located along major river
streams like the Lampasas River. The Bosque clay loam is flooded every 4-12 years and consists
of brown clay loam. Approximately 80 percent of the current project area contains this soil type.
The Bosque clay loam, frequently flooded is located adjacent to the Lampasas River and contains
brown clay loam and silty clay deposits.

Flora and Fauna
According to Blair (1950:113), the most characteristic plant association of this province is a
scrub forest of Mexican cedar (Juniperus mexicana), Texas oak (Quercus texana), stunted live oak
(Quercus virginiana), and various less numerous species.
The project area is also located well within the Prairies Vegetation Region and the Edwards
Plateau Vegetation Region (Gould 1962). Vegetational species characteristic of the region include
Plateau live oak (Quercus fusiformus), Texas oak (Quercus texana), ash juniper (Juniperus ashei),
honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia), cottonwood (Populus
deltoides), pecan (Carya illinoinensis), elm (Ulmus sp.), sumacs (Rhus sp.), Texas persimmon
(Diospyros texana), agarita (Berberis trifoliolata), Texas stillingia (Stillingia texana), yucca (Yucca
spp.), Texas prickly pear (Opuntia Lindheimeri), yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), and American
beautyberry (Callicarpa americana). Grasslands include seep mulhy (Muhlenbergia reverchnoii),
Canadian wild rye (Elymus canadensis), dichanthelium (Dichanthelium spp.), Texas grama
(Bouteloua rigidiseta), and red grama (Bouteloua hirsuta). The project area is now primarily
overgrown with juniper and mixed oaks and grasses.
The project area is located well within the Balconian Biotic Province which is
characteristically represented by a general mixture of fauna from nearby surrounding provinces
(Blair 1950). Typical species found within the project area include White-tailed deer (Odocoileus
virginianus), cotton-tailed rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus), nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus
novemcinctus), black-tailed jack rabbit (Lepus californicus), raccoon (Prycon lotor), hispid cotton
rat (Sigmodon hispidus), wild turkey (Melagris gallopavo), mourning dove (Zenaida macroura),
scissor-tailed flycatcher (Tyrannus forficatus), northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), western
coach whip (Masticophis flagellum testaceus), and the bull snake (Pituophis melanoleucus sayi).

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Bell County is located in the North Central Texas cultural-geographical region as defined by
Biesaart et al. (1985:76). This area is referred to as Central Texas by most archaeologists and is rich
in archaeological sites.
Summaries relevant to the prehistory of Bell County and vicinity have been prepared by
various archaeologists, primarily as a result of work at Fort Hood in Bell and Coryell counties,
Texas (Guderjan et al. 1980; Skinner et al. 1981, 1984; Thomas 1978; Roemer et al. 1985; Carlson
et al. 1986), Belton Reservoir (Shafer et al. 1964), the Youngsport site (Shafer 1963), and Stillhouse
Hollow Reservoir (Shafer et al. 1964; Sorrow et al. 1967). Summaries of the region have been
published by Suhm (1960), Weir (1976), and Prewitt (1981, 1985). Most recently, two thorough
articles concerning Central Texas were published in Volume 66 of the Bulletin of the Texas
Archeological Society. These works, entitled "Forty Years of Archeology in Central Texas," by
Michael B. Collins (1995) and "Implications of Environmental Diversity in the Central Texas
Archeological Region" by Linda Wootan Ellis, G. Lain Ellis, and Charles D. Frederick (1995),
represent a major synthesis of the vast amount of collected data for the region. The following
discussion is taken primarily from the works cited above.
Paleoindian Period
According to Willey and Phillips (1958:80), problems exist with the term “Paleoindian;”
nevertheless, the term is used ubiquitously in the archaeological literature, often to refer to
prehistoric cultures oriented toward big game procurement as a primary means of subsistence.
Collins (1995:381) posited instead that during Clovis times, Paleoindians exploited a diverse
range of fauna that not only included large herbivores such as mammoth, bison, and horse, but
also included smaller animals such as turtles, land tortoises, alligators, mice, badgers, and
raccoons. The results of excavation of a cultural pavement at Kincaid Rockshelter suggest that
the Paleoindian inhabitants of the site returned there repeatedly as part of a regular hunting and
gathering strategy, in contrast with the migratory subsistence pattern of nomadic hunters who
only pursued big game. Thus, it is probable that the Clovis diet included a broad array of plants
(Collins 1990; Collins et al. 1989).
According to Skinner et al. (1981:13), the Paleoindian period is one of the least
understood time periods in Central Texas prehistory, primarily because so few sites have been
excavated. For example, as of 1985, only two Paleoindian sites had been reported for Bell
County (Biesaart et al. 1985:125). Evidence of Paleoindian cultures consists primarily of surfacecollected materials found over much of Central Texas. At Fort Hood, distinctive Paleoindian
projectile points were found in multi-component surface sites and as isolated finds (Carlson et al.
1986:125). Generally, it is believed that this period lasted from about 10,000 B.C. until 6000
B.C. Diagnostic artifacts of the period include dart points of the Angostura, Clovis, Folsom,
Golondrina, and Plainview types as defined by Suhm and Jelks (1962) and Turner and Hester
(1985).

These early sites are often found on old terraces of major river drainages and may be
more distant from major streams than some more recent occupations (Bryan 1931). Some rock
shelters, such as the Levi site, were intensively occupied even though they are located a
considerable distance from major rivers. The only example of a rock shelter in Central Texas
immediately adjacent to a major drainage known to contain Paleoindian occupation is the Horn
Shelter (41BQ46) in Bosque County, Texas (Redder 1985). Collins (1999) reported on the Gault
Site, a major Clovis site in Bell County that is still being studied.

Archaic Period
The Archaic is a comparatively lengthy cultural period, which persisted in Central Texas
from approximately 8500-1250 years Before Present (B.P.). According to Prewitt (1981:71),
“The Archaic Stage dominates all other remains in Central Texas.” Prewitt (1981) has subdivided
the Archaic into eleven phases. Johnson (1987) has questioned the validity of the phase concept
as used by Prewitt, especially the phases occurring before the Middle Archaic. Carlson et al.
(1986:15) grouped these into Early, Middle, Late, and Terminal Periods.
According to Prewitt (1981:77-78), during the Early Archaic there was a “strong
orientation toward the gathering aspect rather than the hunting, and a mobile population was of
low density.” These characteristics apparently were predominant during the Circleville, San
Geronimo, and Jarrell phases (8500-5000 B.P.). In the Middle Archaic, food gathering
apparently became very specialized as evidenced by the presence of numerous burned rock
middens/mounds (Prewitt 1981:78-80). Prewitt divides the Middle Archaic into the Oakalla,
Clear Fork, Marshall Ford, and Round Rock phases (5000-2600 B.P.). It appears that
considerably fewer burned rock middens were formed during the Late Archaic than in the earlier
Archaic. The archaeological record indicates that while bison were important in the diet of
prehistoric peoples, they were not necessarily the principal food source during this time (Prewitt
1981:80-81). The Late Archaic occurred during the San Marcos and Uvalde phases (2600-1750
B.P.). The terminal Archaic, according to the classification by Carlson et al. (1986), includes the
Twin Sisters and Driftwood phases (1750-1250 B.P.). An increase in the importance of gathering
and an apparent peak in site density seem to have occurred during Prewitt’s (1981:82) Driftwood
phase. A majority of the sites in Williamson County are Archaic in age, which, according to
Prewitt (1981:Figure 3), lasted from 8500-1250 B.P. This interpretation is supported by Collins’
(1995:383) assertion that “two-thirds of the prehistory of Central Texas is ‘Archaic’ in
character.”

7

Late Prehistoric Period
This period has been characterized in the archaeological literature as the Neo-American
Stage (Suhm et al. 1954), the Neo-archaic (Prewitt 1981), and the Post-Archaic (Johnson and
Goode 1994). The Late Prehistoric is typically divided into the Austin (1250-650 B.P.) and
Toyah (650-200 B.P.) phases. Technological changes are the primary distinguishing
characteristic of this stage. The archaeological record indicates that during this period, the bow
and arrow became the principal weapon for hunting and warfare, and that the use of ceramics
and the practice of horticulture first appeared in Central Texas and the surrounding regions.
According to Collins (1995:385), during the Late Prehistoric of Central Texas, the bow
and arrow were the first of these cultural innovations to be adopted, followed by pottery, and
finally agriculture though it was of relatively minor importance. Until the onset of these Late
Prehistoric adaptations, most cultural groups continued to practice hunting and gathering as their
principal means of subsistence, as had their ancestors throughout the Archaic and Paleoindian
periods. However, in about 800 B.P., evidence for a different subsistence adaptation appears in
the archaeological record and this cultural time boundary marks the separation between the late
Archaic and the Austin and Toyah phases of the Late Prehistoric period (Collins 1995:385).
The most obvious of the changes that emerged at the beginning of the Late Prehistoric
period was the introduction of the bow and arrow and decreased use of the atlatl or spear
thrower. Otherwise, life ways in the Late Prehistoric were probably quite similar to those in the
earlier Archaic period (Prewitt 1981:74; Weir 1976). A chronological model of bison presence
and absence periods on the southern plains suggests that bison were present during the Toyah
phase but not during the preceding Austin phase (Dillehay 1974).

Historic Period
Collins (1995:386) divides the Historic period of Central Texas into three sub-periods: early,
middle, and late. During the first two, vestiges of both indigenous and European peoples and
cultures were present; however, in the third the indigenous peoples had virtually disappeared. The
early Historic sub-period in Central Texas began in the late 17th century with the first documented
arrival of Europeans. Bell County is situated within the historic range of the Tonkawa Indians who
inhabited the area in the 16th Century (Newcomb 1986). By the 19th Century, they had broken ties
with the Comanche and Wichita and were associated with the Lipan Apache (Aten 1983:32). They
have been described as typical southern Plains Indians who were hunters and gatherers and who
lived along the streams and rivers of Central Texas.
During this period, Texas was occupied by numerous aboriginal groups including the Caddo,
Jumano, Tonkawa, Comanche, and Lipan Apache (Newcomb 1986). Trade is known to have
existed between the Jumanos and the Caddos. The Lipan Apaches and subsequently the
Comanches entered the region from the Plains while following key animal resources as they

8

migrated into Texas. Contact period occupations are often identified by the occurrence of glass
beads, gun parts, gun flints, metal projectile points, and European manufactured ceramics. The
archival search did not locate any Historic Indian sites in Bell County; Texas. In adjacent Coryell
County, a blue glass bead was found with one of the burials at 41CV1, a group burial along the
Leon River (Jackson 1931), and a steel arrow point has been reported as an isolated find on Horse
Creek in the extreme east corner of Coryell County (Campbell 1952).
Historically, Bell County was first settled in 1834 and 1835 by colonists who settled along
Little River. The area was abandoned during the "Runaway Scrape" of 1836, reoccupied, and
deserted again after the fall of Fort Parker in June 1836. The early settlements were constantly
harassed by hostile Indians and, although several forts were established, by 1838 all settlers had left
the county. On May 26, 1839, the Indians suffered a decisive defeat at what is referred to as the
"Famous Bird Creek Fight" about one and a half miles northwest of the present site of Temple,
Texas. However, settlement did not return to the Bell County area until after 1843.
Bell County was created on January 22, 1850 and was named for Peter H. Bell. Nolan
Springs was chosen as the county seat and named Nolanville, but on December 16, 1851 the name
was changed to Belton. Early settlement was along the creeks and rivers. William Pepper and his
family were living on the west side of present-day Kegley Road when the 1850 census was taken.
The Kegleys, Carpenters, and others settled near Pepper Creek during the 1850s, and some members
of these early families are buried at Eulogy Cemetery. Early histories of Bell County refer frequently
to the Shallowford Crossing on the Leon River as an important transportation route for wagon
traffic. The exact location of this crossing has not been identified, but it substantiates the importance
of this part of Bell County during its early settlement. By 1860, most of the land had been taken.
The last serious Indian raid occurred in 1859. With the Indian problem apparently resolved,
settlement increased and the county grew from 4799 in 1860, to 9771 in 1870, and to 20,518 in
1880. The number of farms in the county increased from 640 in 1869, to 2231 in 1871, and to 4249
in 1889. Bell County is chiefly an agricultural region with cotton and corn the leading crops. The
construction of Fort Hood led to a population increase in the county from 44,863 in 1940 to
74,145 in 1950.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
The efforts of members of the Central Texas Archaeological Society and Bell County
Archeological Society have made notable contributions. These include articles in the form of
bulletins, newsletters, special reports, and unpublished manuscripts on file at TARL or with society
members. Bell County has been the subject of intensive investigations by members of the Central
Texas Archeological Society. As a result of the above-mentioned investigations, "Bell County is
one of the better known Central Texas counties and has provided significant information toward the
understanding of prehistoric chronologies in this part of Texas" (Young 1987:9).
In the site files at TARL are numerous pieces of correspondence from landowners and
artifact collectors documenting and describing sites and artifacts found in Bell County. Also present
are copies of unpublished manuscripts, some of which do not provide information concerning
author and date of preparation. Information regarding previous work in other parts of Bell County
appear in the various references cited above, especially the Fort Hood series.
At the time of this survey there were no archaeological sites recorded in the project area.
Surveys by Bradle and Moore (1998), Moore, Bradle and Nordt (1996a, 1996b); Moore and Bradle
(1996) recorded 8 prehistoric and historic sites on Pepper Creek, 2 sites (1 prehistoric and 1 historic)
on Fryers Creek, and 1 site containing prehistoric and historic materials on an unnamed tributary
that flows into Bird Creek. Three of these sites (41BL1066, 41BL1069, 41BL1070) have been
subjected to Phase II testing (Bradle et al. 1997). Bradle et al. (2003) surveyed 101.2 acres, of
which the northern half of the current project traverses across. One site (41BL1202) was recorded
as a mid-twentieth century farmstead that was not considered eligible for inclusion on the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) nor worthy of designation as a State Archaeological Landmark
(SAL). Bradle and Bernhardt (2008) surveyed another railroad construction project nearby that also
found no archaeological sites in the vicinity.
An archeological reconnaissance of a proposed wastewater collection and treatment
improvement in 1982 and 1984 by the Texas Department of Water Resources (Fox and Whitsett
1984) recorded eight prehistoric sites prehistoric sites (41BL259 - 41BL264 and 41BL278 41BL279). According to Fox and Whitsett (1984:6), "some site-specific investigations have been
done in Bell County (Watt 1936; Shafer 1963), but as yet detailed archeological investigations have
not been conducted in the Temple-Belton area." Except for testing at 41BL260 by Wayne C.
Young (1987) of the Texas State Department of Highways and Public Transportation, Highway
Design Division (now Texas Department of Transportation) in 1987, and the three tested sites
mentioned above, no additional site-specific investigations were identified during the literature
search for this project.
Bell County contains numerous prehistoric and historic sites, many potentially eligible for
the National Register of Historic Places or as State Archeological Landmarks. However, certain
sections of the county have not been adequately investigated. The current project area falls within

10

this category. There is reason to believe that a large number of unrecorded sites exist along the
major streams of this area in the form of surface sites, possible rock shelter sites, and buried sites.
Two previous surveys were conducted just west of the project area along Interstate 35.
The first was an old FHA survey, Project 21 and no sites located. Three previously recorded
archaeological sites were recorded west and southwest of the current project area, 41BL1203,
41BL1204, and 41BL1205. Site 41BL1203 was recorded as a prehistoric campsite on the south
terrace of the Lampasas River. It contained burned rock and mussel shell and a few flakes. Site
41BL1204 was recorded as lithic procurement field. Site 41BL1205 was recorded as a lithic
procurement field with tested cobbles and primary flakes. A historic cemetery is located north of
the project area by several hundred feet and on a slightly higher terrace and will not be affected
by the current proposed project.

FIELD METHODS
Background Research
Before entering the field, AAG conducted a background investigation. Site records at the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas were checked for previously
recorded sites in the project area and vicinity. In addition, site reports documenting work in the
region were examined for information concerning archaeological surveys and other work relevant to
the project area. The project was discussed with representatives of the City of Belton to ensure that
the field crew was aware of the correct route for the proposed sewer line.
Field Survey
The fieldwork was accomplished in February and March 2012 using the pedestrian survey
method supported by backhoe trenching. Surface visibility was approximately 60% across the
survey area. In addition to intensive surface inspection, twelve (12) backhoe trenches were excavated
(Figure 2) in order to provide a more expansive view of subsurface soil deposits and all were
negative, except for BHT-1 (Appendix II, Figure 3). The depths of the backhoe trenches varied from
1.66 to 7.00 meters below the surface (Figures 3 and 4). The average depth of the backhoe
trenching was 400.92 centimeters below the surface. No cultural material was encountered in the
backhoe trenches except for BHT-1 which contained a remnant deposit of freshwater mussel shells
but no other artifacts (Figure 3). This area was recorded as prehistoric site 41BL1360.
There also appeared to be some fill deposits present too from the landowner burning debris
and a lot of topsoil has been mined out of the project area. The greatest amount of soil deposits
mined out of the project area are in the vicinity of BHT-1, 2, 6-8, and a large area between BHT-10
and BHT-4 (Figure 2). The landowner has mined soil out of these two large pastures for many years
and no artifacts have been found. Figures 5-13 provide photographic views of the project area and
the boundaries for potential visual effect assessments. The current study noted no visual effects on
any nearby historic properties and natural barriers such as the thick vegetation along the Lampasas
River (eastern boundary), the hill with vegetation to the west, and the fence line with vegetation to
the north all provide greenbelt coverage from any potential visual effects. Further, the area to the
south of the current project area is a cultivated field with no standing structures.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Archival Research
The site records at TARL revealed no sites had been recorded in the project area. Largescale federal projects such as Belton Reservoir, Stillhouse Reservoir, and Fort Hood have recorded
the vast majority of sites in Bell County (see Archaeological Background and Previous
Investigations above). Recent projects by American Archaeology Group LLC personnel have
provided the majority of new data regarding prehistoric and historic utilization of the general project
area (see Previous Investigations above).
Field Survey
The field survey identified only one prehistoric site in the southeastern portion of the
project. It was located on the basis of BHT-1 in which mussel shell was located. Overall, the area is
very disturbed from previous quarrying activities for topsoil removal. The entire project area is
located along the massive floodplain along the Lampasas River.
The only backhoe trench that produced any cultural material was BHT-1, located on the
edge of a contour that then drops down towards T2 above the Lampasas River. Based on the soil
deposits nearby along the southern boundary fenceline, the surface at BHT-1 is 1.22 meters below
the original surface. This area was recorded as prehistoric site 41BL1360. No features or artifacts
were identified during the course of this survey.
Site 41BL1360 was recorded as a buried prehistoric short-term occupation. At BHT-1, fresh
water mussel shell was identified at 47, 68 (few flakes of mussel shell), and 84 centimeters below
the present surface. This site was located along a natural levee that formed along the west side of the
Lampasas River at the 500 foot contour interval. Typically throughout Central Texas, prehistoric
inhabitants moved into these expansive floodplain areas to occupy natural levee features (very
similar to sites 41BL1066 and 41BL1070 along Pepper Creek several miles to the northeast of the
project area-see Bradle et al. 1997).
As noted above, this site has been extremely damaged through topsoil removal over the
years and probably less than 10 percent of the site as located and identified in the current project
area remains intact. The portion that is intact is located in the vicinity of BHT-1 and across the
project boundary fence line to the south. It appears that at least 1.22 meters of soil has been removed
at BHT-1, however, it appears that possibly 2-3 meters of soil has been removed in adjacent areas.
Two radiometric assays yielded dates for the occupation from two zones. The first sample
was recovered from 47 centimeters (1.69 meters below original surface) and the second from 97
centimeters (2.19 meters below the original surface) below the current surface in order to at least
obtain some chronometric dates on the prehistoric occupation time periods at this site. The first
sample (Beta Analytic 324052) obtained at 47 centimeters below the surface produced a
Conventional Radiocarbon age of 3240 +/- 30 BP [(Cal BC 1600 to 1570 (Cal BP 3560 to 3520)
and Cal BC 1560 to 1550 (Cal BP 3510 to 3500) and Cal BC 1540 to 1440 (Cal BP 3490 to 3390)].
The second sample (Beta Analytic 324053) obtained at 97 centimeters below the surface produced
20

a Conventional Radiocarbon age of 3140+/- 30 BP [Cal BC 1490 to 1480 (Cal BP 3440 to 3430)
and Cal BC 1450 to 1380 (Cal BP 3400 to 3340) and Cal BC 1330 to 1320 (Cal BP 3280 to
3280)], thus dating this site minimally to the Middle Archaic time period (2500 – 1000 BC, See
Appendix IV).
Along major floodplain areas, isolated occupation sites can be found including food
collection and preparation such as fresh water mussel shell procurement and cooking and hearths for
larger cooking areas and longer occupation in these areas. Prehistoric inhabitants utilized these large
expansive floodplains for food collection areas and access to the major rivers but larger occupation
sites tend to be in higher and in less frequently flooded areas.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The survey of the proposed South Belton Wastewater Treatment Plant Project in Bell
County, Texas performed for the City of Belton located one prehistoric site (41BL1360) in the
project area. Approximately 10 percent of the site actually remains intact along the southern
boundary fence line and extends to the south where additional cultural deposits are probably
intact. The portion pf site 41BL1360 located in the current project area is not deemed to be
eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) nor worthy of
designation as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL). American Archaeology Group LLC
recommends that construction within the project area should be allowed to proceed as planned
without archaeological monitoring. American Archaeology Group LLC recommends that
construction be allowed to proceed as planned. It is always possible that buried cultural materials
can be missed during any Phase I survey, especially in large expansive floodplains. Therefore,
should any sites be found during the construction of this wastewater treatment plant, all work within
the site area should cease until the situation can be evaluated by the Archeology Division, Texas
Historical Commission, in consultation with American Archaeology Group LLC, Kasberg Patrick
& Associates LP, and the City of Belton.

APPENDIX I: RESEARCH DESIGN AND SCOPE OF WORK
Records Check
As mentioned, during this initial phase of the investigation, the AAG staff contacted the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), in Austin, Texas, to determine if any
archaeological sites had been previously recorded within the current project area. The contents of
the AAG library were also examined as part of the project background search and much of the
preliminary archival work was accomplished in-house. Since AAG had conducted considerable
archaeological work in the vicinity of the project area on previous occasions, the AAG staff was
already familiar with the much of the general project background data.
Permit Application
Before beginning any fieldwork, AAG collaborated with the THC Archeology Division
review staff concerning the level of effort that would be required for the investigation and the results
were made available to the client before the survey commenced. Fieldwork began after issuance of
permit 3762.
Survey Methods
The entire project area will be 100% intensively surveyed using the pedestrian survey
method supported by augering and/or backhoe trenching and examination of eroded and disturbed
areas where cultural materials may be visible on the surface. Backhoe trenching may be used to
examine deep soils to determine if cultural deposits are deeply buried. Herbert G. Uecker will act as
the Principal Investigator. Auger testing and backhoe trenching will meet and exceed the Minimum
Survey Standards for Texas established by the THC.
In areas of poor visibility and environmental settings that have potential for buried cultural
materials, shovel testing will be required and tests will be concentrated in areas of high site
probability and randomly across the project area. All excavated fill will be screened through ¼-inch
hardware cloth. Shovel tests will be manually excavated to sterile clay or bedrock when possible.
The survey crew will be equipped with shovel test forms, notebooks, cameras, compasses,
and a project area map for accurate plotting of shovel tests, backhoe trenches, and archaeological
sites. In addition to shovel testing as a means of identifying buried sites, select areas in alluvial
settings or areas with some appreciable soil depth will be subjected to backhoe trenching. All sites
identified in the project area will be mapped in the field and plotted on a topographic map. Site
locations will also be determined through the use of a Global Positioning System (GPS). Each site
will be recorded using the official State of Texas Archaeological Site Form. In no case will the
survey crew work outside of the project area as depicted on the project area map provided by the
client.

29

Only diagnostic artifacts will be collected from the surface. All artifacts recovered through
shovel testing will be collected. These specimens will be bagged and recorded on a field sack log.
They will be analyzed and prepared for eventual curation at TARL, unless a petition to discard is
prepared and accepted.
The draft report will be submitted to AD-THC for review. Once the report has been
approved by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), copies will be delivered to AD-THC
and the client. AAG will maintain copies of the notes, photographs, site forms, and any other
records produced from the project deemed to be a work product.
Scope of Work
I.

Conduct background check for previously recorded archaeological sites in the project area
and the vicinity. Review the relevant literature.

II.

Discuss the project with the AD-THC reviewer assigned to this project before entering the
field.

III.

Obtain antiquities permit from AD-THC.

IV.

Consult with representative of the sponsor before beginning the field survey.

V.

Perform a 100% pedestrian survey of the project area to include shovel testing, and
examination of all exposed area such as creek banks for buried or displaced artifacts.

VI.

Check for deeply buried sites through the use of backhoe trenching in areas with deep soils.

VII.

Analyze all artifacts recovered and prepare them for curation at TARL.

VIII.

Prepare a draft report and submit copies to the AD-THC and the sponsor for review.

IX.

Make all required changes, correct any mistakes, and submit final report and turn in artifacts
for curation.
