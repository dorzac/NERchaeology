ABSTRACT

HRA Gray & Pape, LLC, of Houston, Texas, performed an intensive pedestrian
survey on a total of 31.93 hectares (78.91 acres) of property proposed for Expansion of Farm
to Market road 1484 in Montgomery County, Texas.
Field investigations were conducted from March 17 to March 24, 2005 and consisted
of walkover, photo-documentation, and shovel testing within the project area. Subsurface
investigation included the excavation of 132 shovel tests in previously undisturbed and
disturbed areas. In October 2005, an intensive pedestrian survey was initiated for portions of
a revised right-of-way (ROW) that lay outside the initial survey ROW done in March. These
portions subsumed a combined total of 2.3 hectares (5.7 acres). A walkover survey took
place over previously undisturbed and disturbed areas and 7 shovel tests were excavated.
During these investigations, buried archaeological remains or features were not
observed within the project area. Shovel tests showed that much of the area has been highly
disturbed by logging, utility and road construction. Several sections of the proposed road
project are located in low-lying or marshy areas that possess a low probability for containing
buried archaeological deposits.
HRA Gray & Pape recommends that no further
archaeological work is required, and that the project be cleared to proceed as planned.

CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTION

Turner Collie & Braden, Inc., contracted with HRA Gray & Pape, LLC of Houston,
Texas (HRA Gray & Pape) to perform an archaeological survey on 38.46 hectares (95.03
acres) of property proposed for the expansion of Farm to Market (FM) road 1484 in
Montgomery County, Texas. Of this amount, 8.83 hectares (21.82 acres) lies in the existing
right-of-way (ROW) of FM 3083. This area was determined disturbed by construction of
FM 3083 and not requiring survey. The resulting amount of surveyable ROW totaled 29.63
hectares (73.21 acres). This ROW was later revised to encompass an estimated 29.97
hectares (74.06 acres), of which approximately 2.3 hectares (5.7 acres) lies outside the
previously proposed alignment (Figure 1). The goal of the archaeological survey was to
determine if the project would adversely affect any buried archaeological materials within the
projectâs Area of Potential Effect (APE).
Work performed to complete this survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities
Permit No. 3669, issued by the Texas Historical Commissionâs Division of Archeology in
February of 2005. All fieldwork and reporting activities were completed with reference to
state (the Antiquities Code of Texas) and federal (National Historic Preservation Act
[NHPA]) guidelines.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The project consists of the expansion of an existing road ROW associated with FM
1484 and construction of new road ROW (Alternative Alignment â1â). Approximately 1.7
kilometers (1.1 miles) of expansion will take place along existing roadway. The remaining
5.47 kilometers (3.4 miles) of the project will include construction through privately owned
secondary-growth forest. The APE for archaeological survey is defined as all property
within the proposed 29.97-hectare (74.06-acre) alignment, and includes a ROW that varies
between approximately 36.6 meters (120 feet) and 49 meters (160 feet) in width. In addition,
five 30-meter by 30-meter (100-foot by 100-foot) proposed workspace locations are
positioned along various creek crossings. In total, approximately 31.93 hectares (78.91
acres) has been surveyed to date. This total includes the original alignment and parts of the
revised alignment that fall outside the initial survey.

CHAPTER II. ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING OF THE STUDY AREA

The following section provides a discussion of the general geomorphological
characteristics found in Montgomery County. This is followed by discussions of soil
morphology, climate, and floral and faunal species typical of the area.

GEOMORPHOLOGY
The Texas Coastal Plain is part of the larger Gulf Coastal Plain. The coastal plain is
characterized by a low topographic relief and extends from Florida to Mexico. The Texas
Coastal Plain reaches as far north as the Ouachita uplift in Oklahoma, and as far west as the
Balcones escarpment in central Texas. The basic geomorphological characteristics of the
Texas coast and associated inland areas, which includes Montgomery County, resulted from
depositional conditions influenced by the combined action of sea level changes from glacial
advance in the northern portions of the continent, and subsequent downcutting and variations
in the sediment load capacity of the regionâs rivers. Montgomery County is underlain by
relatively recent sedimentary rocks and unconsolidated sediments ranging in age from the
Miocene to Holocene (Abbott 2001; Van Siclen 1991).
Although older geologic units have been identified in the region (see Abbott 2001;
Barnes 1992; Van Siclen 1991), units relevant to the study of long-term human occupation in
modern-day Montgomery County include the Beaumont Formation, generally believed to
predate human occupation in the region, and the so-called âDeweyvilleâ terraces, positioned
stratigraphically between the Beaumont and Recent deposits. These terraces date to between
one hundred thousand to four thousand years ago, and are characterized as consisting âof up
to three inset fluvial terracesâ¦(distinguished by the presence of)â¦large looping meander
scarsâ¦â indicative of watercourses capable of fluvial action and discharge markedly greater
than that seen today (Abbot 2001: 16). Overlaying these deposits may be relatively thick or
thin Holocene deposits, laid down in the Montgomery County area by alluvial or eolian
factors, or potentially, marshy environments.
Along smaller rivers, such as the San Jacinto and Trinity, valley infilling has not
advanced to the point where these âDeweyvilleâ formations are completely buried by
Holocene sediments. Consequently, remnants of these deposits are preserved as terraces that
are situated between modern floodplain and upland areas. These terraces would have been
relatively elevated and dry surfaces within the valleys until they were covered by aggrading
overbank deposits (Abbot 2001: 16). Given their physical characteristics, the âDeweyvilleâ
terraces may have been attractive loci for human occupation during the Holocene. While
primary âDeweyvilleâ deposits have a low potential for archaeological remains, the age of
these formations are not clearly established. Therefore, the possibility for buried
archaeological remains exists within portions of the âDeweyvilleâ formation (Abbot 2001:
106).

CLIMATE
Montgomery Countyâs close proximity to the Gulf of Mexico tends to influence the
temperature, rainfall, and relative humidity of the region. Winds usually trend from the
southeast or east, except for in winter months when high-pressure systems can bring in polar
air from the north. Average summer temperatures can reach well into the 90s (degrees
Fahrenheit) and are often accompanied by equally high humidity. Although winter
temperatures can reach into the low 30s (degrees Fahrenheit), below freezing temperatures
usually occur on only a few days out of every year, and are usually restricted to the early
morning hours.
Rainfall occurs most frequently during two precipitation peaks throughout the year,
one which typically occurs in late spring, due to the passage of cold fronts, and the other in
late summer and early fall, resulting from tropical storms and hurricanes (Abbott 2001).
Precipitation in Montgomery County averages 120 centimeters (47.44 inches) annually
(Long 1999).

FLORA AND FAUNA
Present-day Montgomery County is located near the western edge of the
Austroriparian biotic province, and is situated in the Blackland Prairies and Post Oak
Savanna ecoregions (Abbott 2001). Evidence from pollen analysis in Central Texas suggests
that, at least during the Late Pleistocene, the area may have been populated by vegetative
species that were tolerant of a cold weather environment. Climactic fluxuation during the
Holocene would eventually result in a gradual trend towards warmer weather, similar to that
seen today (Abbott 2001).
Late Pleistocene flora may have included populations of spruce, poplar, maple, and
pine (Holloway 1997), in an oak woodland environment that would eventually transition to
an oak savanna in the late Holocene (Abbott 2001). Fauna during this time would include
currently present species such as white-tailed deer and various smaller game, as well as
bison, and, in localized areas, pronghorn sheep and the American alligator (Abbott 2001).
The modern vegetative community associated with this region consists of a diverse
collection of trees and undergrowth (Abbott 2001). Various pine species, such as loblolly
and shortleaf, are primarily present, but identified trees also include various oaks and elms.
Honeysuckle, dewberry, yaupon, and blackberry are common, as are indiangrass and
bluegrasses (Abbott 2001; McClintock et al 1972).
The modern faunal community includes mammals such as deer, squirrel, opossum,
raccoon, skunk and various small rodents, numerous bird species, and reptiles including the
Texas rat snake, the western cottonmouth, the kingsnake, and several turtle species. Black
bear and bison were present occasionally in the past (Abbott 2001).

CHAPTER III. CULTURAL SETTING OF THE STUDY AREA

The upper Texas coast is viewed by many researchers as a buffer zone between
cultural regions. Patterson (1995) describes the archaeological record in this area as being an
interface between the Southern Plains and the Southeast Woodlands. Along similar lines,
both Shafer (1975) and Aten (1984) have categorized the Post-Archaic archaeological record
of this region as Woodland. This categorization is not meant to literally invoke the exact
cultural patterns and chronology of the Woodlands culture found to the east. But as Aten
(1984:74) states, âit loosely connotes activities by populations on a geographic as well as a
cultural periphery of the southeastern Woodlands.â Under this framework the prehistoric
archaeology of Southeast Texas represents a mixture of diffused technology and local
innovation.
Dee Ann Story (1990) has suggested that the culture of Southeast Texas is distinctive
enough to merit a separate designation by the Late Prehistoric. The Mossy Grove cultural
tradition is a heuristic concept based on technological similarities shared by groups in this
region. The primary marker of this technological tradition is the plain, sandy-paste Goose
Creek pottery that is found in this region from the Early Ceramic through Early Historic
periods.
Ethnic affiliations for the Southeast Texas region are not entirely clear. Aten (1983)
has defined the Brazos Delta-West Bay, Galveston Bay, and Sabine Lake archaeological
areas and suggests that they may correlate with the Historic territories of the Coco, Akokisa,
and Atakapa groups respectively. Similarly, historic reconstructions of the inland subregion
suggest a number of possible group affiliations (Story 1990). The historic economic
inland/coastal cycle of the Akokisa, which stretched from Galveston Bay to the San Jacinto
River basin, may mean that archaeological materials in the Lake Conroe area are affiliated
with this group. Alternately, these remains may be associated with the Bidais who occupied
territory immediately to the north of the Akokisa groups. At this point in time, it is not
possible to identify the cultural affiliation of the groups that inhabited the inland subregion.
In part, this is a function of the dynamic nature of this region in which a number of cultural
traditions met and diffused.
The Southeast Texas region is divided into inland and coastal margin subregions,
which have archaeologically distinctive subsistence strategies, settlement patterns, and
artifact types. Archaeological and historic evidence suggests that some groups exploited
inland resources year round, while other groups spent parts of the year both inland and on the
coast.

PREHISTORIC ARCHAEOLOGICAL TIME PERIODS
Based on aspects of material culture, researchers have identified six archaeological
time periods associated with Native Americans in southeast Texas; in general, these include
the Paleoindian, Archaic (with Early, Middle, and Late subdivisions), Ceramic, Late
Prehistoric, Protohistoric, and Historic Indian. Archaeologists within the region agree on the
general framework of cultural time periods, while disagreeing on the temporal boundaries of
these periods. Pattersonâs (1995) chronology, for example, includes Early Paleoindian
(10,000-8000 B.C.), Late Paleoindian (8000-5000 B.C.), Early Archaic (5000-3000 B.C.),
Middle Archaic (3000-1500 B.C.), Late Archaic (1500 B.C.-A.D. 100), Early Ceramic (A.D.
100-A.D. 600), Late Prehistoric (A.D. 600-1500), Protohistoric (A.D. 1500-1700), and the
Historic Indian (A.D. 1700-1800) periods. In contrast, Ensor (1990) offers a Southeast Texas
chronology that includes Paleoindian (10,000-8000 B.C.), Early Archaic (8000-5000 B.C.),
Middle Archaic (5000-1000 B.C.), Late Archaic (1000 B.C.-A.D. 400), Early Ceramic (A.D.
400-A.D. 800), and Late Ceramic (A.D. 800-A.D. 1750). Despite these differences, the
chronologies developed by researchers are based primarily on changes in projectile point
technologies within the region and the introduction of pottery. It is generally recognized that
a broad-based hunting and gathering lifestyle was utilized throughout all time periods.

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD
Evidence is sparse for Paleoindian habitation, and much of what is known about the
period in the area comes from a compilation of materials gathered from the state of Texas
and North America. At the close of the Pleistocene, large game hunters crossed the Bering
Strait, and within a few millennia had penetrated into South America (Culberson 1993;
Newcomb 1961). The Paleoindian people traveled in small bands (Culberson 1993) and
were mega-fauna hunter-gathers with the bulk of their meat protein derived from mammoths,
mastodons, giant bison, and giant sloths. These groups carried with them an easily
recognizable stone tool material culture, though admittedly, little is known about their
wooden or bone tools and their clothing types. Diagnostic points such as fluted Clovis,
Folsom, and Plainview points can be used to identify a siteâs Paleo component, and the
nature of these points demonstrate the nature of their hunting style. The above points are
large and designed to be attached to a spear. No evidence of bow and arrow hunting has
been found associated with this period (Culberson 1993; Newcomb 1961).

ARCHAIC PERIOD
With the retreat of the glaciers (the Hypsithermal period), the mega-fauna upon which
the Paleoindian peoples depended gradually became extinct. This shift in food supply is seen
as the pivotal transition point between the Paleo and Archaic periods (Biesaart et al. 1985;
Culberson 1993; Newcomb 1961). Though dates often disagree (ranging from 8000 B.C.
10

marking the beginning of the Early Archaic [Culberson 1993], to Aten [1984] stating that the
transition from Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric-Woodland began around A.D. 100), there are
three progressive stages recognizable during the Archaic period: the Early, Middle, and Late.
Much of what is know about the Early Archaic peoples indicates that they were small,
isolated bands of hunter-gatherers that remained in relatively restricted regions (Aten 1984).
With the loss of the mega-fauna as a food source, the Early Archaic peoples adopted the
hunting of smaller game such as bison and deer and increased their reliance on foraging
(Culberson 1993). The material record fits the transitional makeup of this period because
there was a dramatic shift from the large spear points of the Paleoindian period to a reliance
on smaller dart type points. Diagnostic designs for this period are Dalton, San Patrice,
Angostura, Golondrina, Merserve, Scottsbluff, Wells, Hoxie, Gower, Uvalde, Martindale,
Bell, Andice, Baird, and Taylor (Turner and Hester 1993). These points are much more
crudely made than their Paleo precursors, but remain designed for use on a spear shaft.
The Middle Archaic period saw the largest growth in technology and in the number of
stone tools utilized. Specialized tools appeared for the milling of wild plant foodstuffs
(Culberson 1993) along with a large assortment of tools for food preparation and
procurement. Gravers, scrapers, axes and choppers, knives, drills and polished stone tools,
also known as ground stone tools began to appear in large quantities (Newcomb 1961).
Diagnostic points such as Gary, Kent, Palmillas, Nolan, Travis, Belvedere, Pedernales,
Marshall, Williams, and Lange predominate the spectrum of dart points from the Middle
Archaic period (Turner and Hester 1993; see also the Edwards Plateau Aspect [Newcomb
1961]). The advent of the atlatl also seems to be placed within this period (Culberson 1993).
The Late Archaic period saw a dramatic increase in the population densities of Native
American groups. Human habitation of areas rich in diverse flora and fauna intensified, as
did the variety of materials and artifacts (Culberson 1993; Aten 1984). Late Archaic peoples
began relying heavily on foraging tubers, berries, and nuts and hunting small game such as
deer, rabbits, and raccoons, as well as fish and shellfish, and birds. Groups became socially
more complex than earlier periods and the result was an increasing intercommunication with
neighboring groups. Culberson (1993:55) states that a âLapidary Industryâ developed in
which stone artifacts were made from exotic materials (jasper, hematite, quartz, shale, slate,
etc.) acquired from sources great distances away. These materials were fashioned into an
increasingly complex array of household goods such as celts, plummets, banner stones,
mortars and pestles, and pendants; also during this period there is an increase in the
occurrence of sandstone bowls (Culberson 1993). Diagnostic points of this period are
difficult to distinguish from those of the Middle Archaic. Gary and Kent points remain
prevalent in southeast Texas, while other points such as Marcos, Montell, San Gabriel,
Mahomet, Fairland, and Castroville also appear at times (Turner and Hester 1993).

11

LATE PREHISTORIC AND PROTOHISTORIC PERIODS
The transitional period between Late Archaic and Woodland-Late Prehistoric is a
period marked by an intensification of group dynamics across Texas. Turner and Hester
(1993) see the first signs of village sites in the lower Pecos valley as well as the preliminary
stages of Caddo development in the east. The advent of the bow and arrow is believed by
most (Aten 1984; Culberson 1993; Newcomb 1961; Turner and Hester 1993) to be from this
period, though some may place it later. Most importantly for archaeological investigations,
the first signs of pottery begin to emerge at sites from this period. Although the amount and
variety of pottery intensifies during the Late Prehistoric, it is an excellent way of determining
the terminus post quem of a site. Fishing, bison hunting, and the collection of wild flora
intensifies beyond the level of the Late Archaic period during this stage, but there is no
sufficient data to demonstrate the initial advent of sedentary agricultural. The diagnostic
points of this period are Catahoula, Friley, Alba, and Bonham (Turner and Hester 1993).
The Late Prehistoric (also known as Woodland and Ceramic Periods) continue from
the end of the Archaic period to the historic period ushered in by the Spanish Missions and
Anglo-American settlers. During this period there is a shift to the almost total use of arrow
points such as Perdiz and Scallorn (Turner and Hester 1993), and almost every group now
has pottery. According to Aten (1984), there are nearly 18 different types of pottery from
this period currently identified for the east Texas Coast alone based on temper, paste, and
design. It is during this period that peoples known today as the Caddo, Atakapans, and Bidai,
to name a few, are identifiable both culturally and materially. This is mostly due to the
historical sources of the seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries that aid in the
reconstruction of the past cultures in the area.
Hernando De Soto encountered the Native Americans of the region during his
expedition in 1542 (Hudson 1976); it was the first recorded meeting with the Caddo peoples.
The first expeditions by La Salle in 1687 and the subsequent settlement in the eighteenth
century by Europeans continued to document the presence of Native American groups in the
area (Aten 1984). French traders and Spanish missionaries encountered the Hasinai, also
known as the Neches Angelina, who became allies of the Spanish against the western Apache
tribes (Newcomb 1961). The later historical sources identify the Hisinai as one of the two
main groups in the area of eastern Texas that fall under the Caddo culture (the primary
culture that dominated the Piney Woods area), the other of which is the Kadohadacho (La
Vere 1998; Gregory 1986).
The loose cultural group, known as the Atakapans, dominated the majority of the land
in what is now Montgomery County. Their language group extended from the Gulf coast to
the Trinity and San Jacinto Rivers and they had much in common with the coastal group
known as the Karankawas (Aten 1984). The Atakapans were subdivided into regional
groups. The Akokisas dwelled primarily on the shores of the Trinity and San Jacinto Rivers.
The Patiris group occupied the land north of the San Jacinto valley. The Bidias group
12

dominated the Trinity Valley and to their north was the small group known as the Deadoso.
Most of what is known about the Atakapans culture comes from the early accounts of the
French explorer DeBellise. They are described as primarily hunter-gather groups who relied
somewhat on agriculture and fishing (Sjoberg 1951).
In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Spanish and French used the Native
American groups as pawns in the two nationsâ quest to settle the area (Newcomb 1961).
Most destructive for all native groups in the region was the influx of European diseases.
When Anglo-American settlers began moving into the area in mass around the 1850s, disease
and warfare had decimated the groups to near extinction.

HISTORIC PERIOD DEVELOPMENT
It is believed that the first European to enter the region known today as Montgomery
County was the French explorer Rene Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, around the year
1687 (Long 1999). This expedition in turn forced the Spanish overlords of the region to
mount retaliatory expeditions to the region to reclaim the land. Though the Spanish did
manage to establish three missions along Spring Creek, which is within the boundaries of
present-day Montgomery County, they never successfully established permanent settlements
throughout the region. The missions were abandoned around 1756, and only sporadic
settlement occurred until the issuance of land grants by the Spanish and Mexican authorities
to Stephen F. Austin. Anglo-American settlers began to pour in and nearly 42 families
obtained legal land titles from the government. One important early settler to the area was
Andrew Montgomery, who established a trading post on the Loma del Toro crossroads. This
trading post soon grew into the town of Montgomery, which in 1837 with the formation of
Montgomery County became the county seat.
Named after the regionâs largest existing city, Montgomery County was created by
the Texas Legislature in 1837. It was the third county established by the republic. The
original borders of the county spanned from the Trinity River on the east to the Brazos River
on the West, the Old San Antonio Road to the north and the San Jacinto River to the south.
Today, Montgomery County is bounded by Walker and San Jacinto Counties to the north,
Harris County to the south, Waller and Grimes Counties to its west, and Liberty County to
the east.
Situated at the juncture of what is today known as the East Texas Timberlands/Piney
Woods region and the Texas Coastal Plain, the nineteenth century landscape consisted of
dense forests situated on exceptionally fertile soil. This attracted many settlers who
immediately began to clear the land in order to exploit it for agricultural production and
cattle grazing. Ranching and basic subsistence farming were the regionâs primary
agricultural enterprise until they were superceded in the 1850s by cotton production. The
cotton industry, driven by slave labor and the plantation economy system, experienced a
great boom during prior to the Civil War, partially by exploiting overland trade opportunities
with the growing metropolises of Houston and Galveston.
13

It was not until the post-war era that the region faced its first economic downturn.
Without the wartime demand for agricultural goods and the loss of slave labor, planters who
had overextended themselves to meet the increased demand for cotton found themselves
without a market and in possession of lands with depleted soils. Recovery for the county did
not occur until the construction of several railroad lines in the 1870s. The InternationalGreat Northern Railroad built a line across the county, and the Houston and Texas Central
built a line through Navasota and Montgomery Counties. These lines missed the city of
Montgomery, which was at that time the county seat, but they did intersect at the small
community of Conroe; similarly, the Gulf, Santa Fe, and Colorado rail-lines also intersected
there. Shortly thereafter, in 1889, the county seat was moved to Conroe and has remained
there since.
With the construction of the railroads through out the county, the region saw
increased development of the lumber industry. Long (1999) states that roughly forty-five
steam-powered sawmills were in operation throughout the county in 1882. In 1914, the Delta
Land and Timber Company built the Southâs largest timber mill near Conroe. The timber
industry remained the largest revenue source for the county until the 1920s when there was a
steep decline in the amount of available timber within the region due to uncontrolled logging.
Long (1999) also states that in the 1870s the county had eighty percent forest coverage, but
over the next four decades most of the county was deforested.
This deforestation opened the land to a further increase in ranching and farming.
Despite a brief resurgence in cotton production, by the 1910s many farmers began growing
fruits and vegetables in order to meet the demands of the nearby coastal metropolises. The
region saw another downturn when the effects of the Great Depression reached the area, and
continued until the post World War II period. Though the regional farmers benefited little,
the county prospered in the 1930s and beyond due to the discovery of oil near Conroe in
1932. The discovery of oil brought unimaginable wealth to the region as well as a four-fold
population increase. With oil fields discovered all around the county, Montgomery County
soon became the richest oil producing regions in the United States. To date, oil remains the
primary source of income for the county, while the majority of agricultural income comes
from livestock.

CHAPTER IV. PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

Prehistoric archaeological sites identified in the inland regions of the Gulf Coastal
Plain tend to consist of ephemeral, shallow deposits reflecting short-term occupation
episodes. In general, these sites contain temporally non-diagnostic lithic scatters, thin
subsurface deposits, or suggest the presence of multiple cultural components within a mixed
stratigraphic archaeological context.
The majority of inland prehistoric sites consist of sandy middens with high lithic
material counts and moderate amounts of pottery located near water sources. These sites are
interpreted as representing base camps and there is a notable absence of satellite activity
areas. Within these base camp sites distinct activity loci are present (Patterson 1995).
Lithic artifacts recovered at sites near the current project area are primarily
manufactured from chert and petrified wood. Chert deposits are concentrated in the western
portion of the south Texas region, while petrified wood dominates in the eastern portion of
the region. This geographic parity is generally reflected in the types of materials found at
sites. Sites in the western and central portions of south Texas have predominately chert
artifacts with some petrified wood. Conversely, artifacts recovered from sites in the eastern
portion of south Texas are mainly manufactured of petrified wood (Patterson 1995:256).
Extra-local lithic materials found in the region include Edwards Plateau chert and ground
stone from Arkansas sources. The presence of these materials may suggest the presence of
regional trade networks or through the movement of groups or individuals into the region, as
in the case of the Edwards Plateau material.
Inland sites have a high debitage to core ratio indicating that primary reduction most
often was carried out at source locations. The presence of point preforms in various stages of
production and failure at campsites indicate that blanks and preforms were being transported
back to these locations for final reduction (Patterson 1995). The unifacial tools found at sites
are typically flakes utilized from the bifacial thinning process. These tool types include
scrapers, denticulates, notched tools, perforators, and gravers. These formal tools occur only
in small numbers at inland sites.
Projectile point types, along with ceramics on the coastal margin, are the most
distinctive artifacts associated with archaeological sites in southeast Texas. The various
types serve as hallmarks of the cultural periods of the region. These types range from the
Clovis and Folsom points found in the Early Paleoindian period, to the stemmed points of the
Archaic, to the dart points of Late Archaic/Early Ceramic, and finally to the arrow points of
the Late Prehistoric ca. A.D. 500 or 600. The projectile point technologies found in the
region were influenced by adjacent regions through time including the southern plains,
southeast woodlands, Louisiana, and north, central, and south Texas.
15

A brief overview of selected research projects conducted in close proximity to the
study area is presented below. The results of the background investigation regarding the
presence of archaeological resources near the current project area are presented in Chapter
VI.
A road expansion of FM 3083 was the subject of a Phase 1 survey conducted by
SWCA, Inc. Environmental Consultants. The survey found that a large portion of the ROW
had been heavily disturbed due to logging and housing construction. Parts of the area were
backhoe trenched to test for deep deposits. Four flakes were found in the area, which the
survey team designated as isolated finds (Barile 2002).
Harry Shafer and Thomas Stearns recorded a subsurface site within the Sam Houston
National Forest in 1975. The goal of this project was to develop an interpretation of the site
prior to the construction of a recreational center. Most of the recovered artifacts consisted of
shallow, dispersed deposits dating to the Early and Middle Archaic periods (Shafer and
Stearns 1975).
A 1968 project conducted by Shafer examined property associated with the
construction of the Conroe Reservoir. This survey resulted in the identification of a number
of prehistoric campsites containing Archaic and Late Prehistoric artifacts. Shafer has
proposed that artifacts recovered from this area represent the presence of a border territory
between the Caddo culture area to the north and the cultures of the Galveston Bay area to the
south (Shafer 1968).
Leland Bement, working in the Lake Creek area in 1987, identified 46 prehistoric
sites; a few of these consisted of multi-component sites, which yielded deposits composed of
prehistoric and historic artifacts that were recovered from a mixed archaeological context
(Bement 1987).

CHAPTER V. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

This survey was designed to identify and assess preliminarily archaeological resources
that may be impacted by the proposed project, as well as to assess effects to archaeological
materials impacted by construction activities initiated by this project.

RESEARCH DESIGN
The project area is situated on 29.97 hectares (74.06 acres) of land proposed for
expansion of FM 1484. Construction activities associated with this undertaking will consist of
the expansion of 1.7 kilometers (1.1 miles) of existing roadway and the creation of 5.47
kilometers (3.4 miles) of new roadway. The archaeological survey project area is defined as all
property within the proposed alignment, and includes a ROW that varies between approximately
36.6 meters (120 feet) and 49 meters (160 feet) in width.
The Houston Potential Archaeological Liability Map (PALM) GIS database, compiled
by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Austin Environmental Affairs Division, is
a probability modeling tool developed to assist researchers in determining whether intact
prehistoric archaeological deposits are likely to exist in a particular area (Abbott 2001). This
planning tool was referenced during the development of the research design. Survey of this
project area consisted of intensive pedestrian survey utilizing shovel testing, photodocumentation, and pedestrian reconnaissance.

LITERATURE REVIEW AND SITE FILE RESEARCH STRATEGY
Site file research was initiated by reviewing records maintained by the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas, and by consulting on-line
research archives maintained by the Texas Historical Commission (THC). Site file research
was performed in order to identify all previously recorded archaeological sites within 1.6kilometers (1-mile) of the project areas. Site file research was used to provide a historic
context to the archaeological survey, and additional documentary research was conducted in
order to provide an understanding of the development and history of the APE, the
surrounding area, and southeast Texas in general. This research then was used to prepare an
overview history of the area, and provided an understanding of the contextual framework of
Montgomery Countyâs prehistory and history.

17

METHODOLOGY
The archaeological investigations associated with the current undertaking were
designed to identify and record the existence of buried archaeological resources within the
defined project boundaries. These field methods also facilitated the collection of data needed
in order to determine whether additional investigations would be required to evaluate the
potential eligibility of any newly defined archaeological material for inclusion on the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or as a state designated landmark.
Prior to fieldwork mobilization, the project location was plotted against data
available on relevant PALM units. Although no project-specific PALM was created by
TxDOT for this project, by referring to Abbott (2001) it was determined that the majority of
the proposed project is located in PALM Unit 2, which recommends surface survey and
shovel testing only. Smaller portions are located in map unit 4, which is considered
disturbed, and areas near creeks are located in map unit 1; deep testing is recommended in
these areas when deep impacts are anticipated. Archaeological methods employed during
this survey consisted of pedestrian survey augmented by systematic shovel testing. In areas
where surface visibility allowed for an examination of the ground surface (i.e. surface
visibility greater than 30 percent), a surface inspection of an area measuring 4 meters2 (43
feet2) was also performed at the location of each planned shovel test.
Shovel tests were placed at close intervals (30 meters [100 feet]) in areas considered
to have a high-probability for containing archaeological material. In low-probability areas,
shovel tests were placed at 50-meter (164-feet) intervals. Regardless of the test interval, linear
transects were utilized for the positioning of these shovel tests within the limits of the survey
area. Shovel tests were not excavated in areas containing standing water or areas of
excessive slope (greater than 20 percent). In the ROW proposed for expansion of existing
roadway, shovel tests were placed along two transects situated on either side of the road. In
the portion of the project area where construction of new roadway is proposed, shovel tests
were placed along two transects spaced 30 meters (100 feet) apart and equidistant from a preestablished centerline.
Shovel tests typically measured 30 centimeters (12 inches) in diameter and were
excavated to a maximum depth of 1 meter (3 feet) into the underlying substratum, or until
saturated or culturally sterile subsoil was encountered. Removed soils were screened through
1
/4 -inch hardware cloth. Descriptions of soil texture and color followed standard terminology
and the Munsell (1994) soil color charts. Additional information concerning soils encountered
was recorded on standardized shovel test forms for each excavation. Soils encountered in
sections of the project APE proposed for bridge locations (i.e. ROW and workspaces) were
assessed for their potential to contain deeply buried intact sites and for the need to conduct deep
test trenching by backhoe.

18

CHAPTER VI. RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

No previou0sly recorded sites or National Register properties are located within the
project APE. No newly identified archaeological sites were encountered during survey. The
results of the site file research are discussed in the following section, followed by a
discussion of the results of the intensive pedestrian survey.

SITE FILE AND LITERATURE RESEARCH
Site file research was conducted at TARL and supplemented by consulting on-line
research archives maintained by the THC. Research objectives were to identify all recorded
archaeological sites within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the project area.

PREVIOUSLY RECORDED SITES
Site file research indicated that 1 previously recorded archaeological site (41MQ2) is
located within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the current project area (Table 1). Site 41MQ2 is
positioned south of the project area near the confluence of Little Caney Branch and Stewarts
Creek. The site consists of a scatter of prehistoric lithic material that had been exposed and
redistributed by heavy machinery.

INTENSIVE PEDESTRIAN SURVEY
Intensive pedestrian survey activities were designed to assess the potential impact that
construction processes might have on archaeological resources located within the proposed
road expansion project area. Two surveys took place for the project, the first based on the
original alignment and the second for the revised alignment. During the first mobilization
the project area was subdivided into 7 segments (numbered 1 through 7) subsuming a total of
7.24 kilometers (4.5 miles) (Figures 2 and 3). The results of the segment surveys are
described below.
19

SEGMENT 1
Survey Segment 1 measured a total of 1770 meters (5808 feet) in length. It originated
at FM 2432 and ended at the point where the proposed road alignment diverged from the
existing road ROW (Figure 2, Plate 1). Shovel tests were conducted along 2 transects
positioned on opposites sides of the existing road. Each transect was oriented parallel to the
existing road and positioned approximately 15 meters from the edge of the road. Shovel tests
were excavated at 100-meter (328-foot) intervals. Shovel tests were not excavated in areas
of disturbance associated with structures and buried utility lines or in areas of standing water.
A total of 22 shovel tests were excavated in this segment. The typical soil profile observed in
this segment, as seen in Shovel Test 1:1:13, consisted of a surface layer of dark grayish
brown (10YR 4/2) silty sand to a depth of 23 centimeters (9 inches), overlying a stratum of
pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty sand to a depth of 1 meter (3.28 feet) (Figure 4). All shovel
tests were negative for archaeological material.

SEGMENT 2
Survey Segment 2 measured a total of 210 meters (689 feet). It extended from FM
1484 to a pipeline ROW (Figure 2, Plate 2). Shovel tests were conducted along 2 transects at
30-meter (98.43-foot) intervals. Shovel tests were not excavated in areas of disturbance or
standing water. A total of 10 shovel tests were excavated in this segment. A representative
soil profile of the area, seen in Shovel Test 2:1:4, consisted of a surface layer of pale brown
(10YR 6/3) mottled with black (10YR 2/1) sand to a depth of 5 centimeters (2.8 inches)
overlying a stratum of pale brown (10YR 6/3) sand to a depth of 1 meter (3.28 feet) (Figure
4). All shovel tests were negative for archaeological material.

SEGMENT 3
Survey Segment 3 measured a total of 560 meters (1,837 feet). It extended from a
pipeline ROW to an unnamed creek (Figure 2, Plates 2 and 3). Shovel tests were conducted
along 2 transects at 30-meter (98.43-foot) intervals. Shovel tests were not excavated in areas
of standing water. A total of 29 shovel tests were excavated in this segment. A typical soil
profile observed in the segment, represented by Shovel Test 3:1:15, consisted of a surface
layer of grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty sand to a depth of 17 centimeters (6.6 inches)
overlying a stratum of yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sand to a depth of 1 meter (3.28 feet)
(Figure 4). All shovel tests were negative for archaeological material.

SEGMENT 4
Survey Segment 4 measured a total of 570 meters (1,870 feet). It extended from an
unnamed creek to the East Fork of Crystal Creek (Figure 2, Plates 3 and 4). Shovel tests
were conducted along 2 transects at 30-meter (98.43-foot) intervals.
A total of 26 shovel tests were excavated in this segment. Two proposed workspaces
(WS1 and WS2) were situated adjacent to this segment. WS1 was surveyed by the
placement of 5 shovel tests and WS2 was surveyed by the excavation of 3 shovel tests. A
typical soil profile observed in Segment 4, as represented by Shovel Test 4:1:2, consisted of a
surface stratum of grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty sand to a depth of 12 centimeters (4.7
inches) overlying a layer of dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) sand to a depth of 74
centimeters (29.13 inches) and was terminated due to water intrusion (Figure 4). All shovel
tests were negative for archaeological material.

SEGMENT 5
Survey Segment 5 measured a total of 1,300 meters (4,265 feet). It extended from the
East Fork of Crystal Creek to an unnamed road (Figure 3, Plates 4 and 5). Shovel tests were
conducted along 2 transects at 30-meter (98.43-foot) intervals in high probability areas and at
100-meter (328-foot) intervals in low probability areas. A total of 25 shovel tests were
excavated in this segment. Two proposed workspaces (WS3 and WS4) were located adjacent
to this segment. WS3 was surveyed by the excavation of 4 shovel tests and WS4 was
surveyed by the excavation of 2 shovel tests. A typical soil profile observed in Segment 5, as
represented by Shovel Test 5:1:7, consisted of a surface layer of grayish brown (10YR 5/2)
silty sand to a depth of 8 centimeters (3.15 inches) overlying a stratum of yellowish brown
(10YR 5/8) silty sand to a depth of 83 centimeters (32.68 inches) and was terminated due to
water intrusion (Figure 4). All shovel tests were negative for archaeological material.

SEGMENT 6
Survey Segment 6 measured a total of 1,390 meters (4,560 feet). It extended from an
unnamed road to a fence line (Figure 3, Plates 5 and 6). Shovel tests were conducted along 2
transects at 100-meter (328-foot) intervals. A total of 20 shovel tests were excavated in this
segment. One proposed workspace (WS5) was surveyed by the excavation of 4 shovel tests.
A typical soil profile observed in Segment 6, as represented by Shovel Test 6:2:12, consisted
of a surface layer of brown (10YR 5/3) silty sand to a depth of 9 centimeters (3.54 inches).
This was underlain by a stratum of light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silty sand to a depth of
71 centimeters (27.95 inches) (Figure 4). This was followed by a layer of brownish yellow
(10YR 6/6) clay mottled with yellowish red (5YR 4/6) to a depth of 1 meter (3.28 feet). All
shovel tests were negative for archaeological material.

SEGMENT 7
Survey Segment 7 measured a total of 830 meters (2,723 feet). It extended from a
fence line to FM 3083 (Figure 3, Plate 6). This segment was situated within the existing
ROW of TxDOT Road. Due to extensive landscape modification within this segment, a
pedestrian surface reconnaissance was conducted. Two survey transects were positioned on
opposite sides of the road. A surface inspection was performed over the entire length of the
segment. No archaeological material was observed at the surface, and subsurface disturbance
from previous construction suggests that the area contains a low probability for the discovery
of intact, buried resources.

REVISED ROW INTENSIVE PEDESTRIAN SURVEY
During a second mobilization in October 2005, portions of a revised project ROW
that fell outside the initial project survey were examined by walkover and shovel testing.
These portions were divided into three segments (Segments AA, BB, and CC) and consisted
of a total of 2.3 hectares (5.7 acres). A total of eight shovel tests were excavated within these
portions. The results of the segment surveys are described below.

SEGMENT AA
This segment parallels the end of Segment 1 and all of Segment 2 of the first
mobilization survey. It extends approximately 580 meters (1903 feet) south and falls outside
of the original alignment to a maximum of 27 meters (88.58 feet) south and/or east of the
original alignment (Figure 2). Portions of this segment cross sections of property containing
existing modern structures and roads (Anmar Drive and existing portions of FM 1484). The
segment ends at the pipeline ROW that divided Segment 2 from Segment 3 of the first
mobilization. Two shovel tests were placed within Segment AA, placed approximately 100
meters (328 feet) apart. These tests exhibited profiles resembling that of Shovel Test 2:1:4
(Figure 4). Shovel tests were negative for archaeological material.

SEGMENT BB
This segment parallels the beginning portion of Segment 3 of the first mobilization
starting at the pipeline ROW and extending approximately 430 meters (1411 feet) southwest
and falls outside of the original alignment by a maximum of 23 meters (75.46 feet) to the
south (Figure 2). Tests were located approximately 15 meters (49.21 feet) south of a cut line
measuring 10 meters (32.81 feet) across (Plate 7) and were placed approximately 100 meters
(328 feet) apart. A typical soil profile observed in Segment BB, as represented by Shovel
Test 2, consisted of a surface layer of grayish brown (10YR5/2) sand to a depth of 30
centimeters (11.81 inches). This was underlain by a layer of light reddish brown (5YR6/4).

sand mottled with grayish brown (10YR5/2) sand, and containing 25 percent ironstone
concretions and some clay inclusions to a depth of 70 centimeters (27.56 inches). Following
this was a layer of 50 percent light reddish brown (5YR6/4) sand with 30 percent clay and 20
percent ironstone concretions (Figure 4). These shovel tests were negative for archaeological
material.

SEGMENT CC
This segment parallels the beginning portion of Segment 7 of the first mobilization,
starting at a fence line on TxDOT Road and extending approximately 310 meters (1017 feet)
south and falls outside of the original alignment by a maximum of 13 meters (42.65 feet) to
the west (Figure 3). Tests were located approximately 15 meters (49.21 feet) west into the
treeline and were placed approximately 100 meters (328 feet) apart. Two shovel tests were
excavated within this segment. A typical soil profile observed in Segment CC, as
represented by Shovel Test 2, consisted of a surface layer of pale brown (10YR 6/3) sand
containing few gravel and ironstone concretions to a depth of 20 centimeters (7.87 inches).
This was underlain by a layer of mixed brownish yellow (10YR 6/8), grayish brown (10YR
5/2), and red (2.5YR 4/8) clay (Figure 4). These shovel tests were negative for
archaeological material.

CHAPTER VII. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

This report presents the findings of an intensive pedestrian survey conducted for
archaeological resources on a total of 31.93 hectares (78.91 acres) of property proposed for
the expansion of FM 1484 in Montgomery County, Texas.
Initial investigation consisted of a background literature and site files search to
identify the presence of recorded sites in close proximity to the current project areas.
Previously recorded archaeological sites were not identified within the project area.
However, one previously identified prehistoric archaeological site (41MQ2) was recorded
within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the project area. This resource is not located within the
current projectâs APE, and will not be affected by construction.
Field investigation consisted of pedestrian reconnaissance, photo-documentation, and
shovel testing. Subsurface investigation included the excavation of 139 shovel tests in
previously undisturbed and disturbed areas to depths ranging between 5 to 100 centimeters (2
to 39.37 inches).
In general, the soils encountered during fieldwork were similar to those described in
McClintock et al (1972). Exceptions to this included areas where modern construction
activities have resulted in the redeposition of the existent soil horizons as seen along existing
roads. Several portions of the proposed ROW where thought to possess a high probability
for buried archaeological resources. These high probability areas were located along several
creeks that cross the proposed ROW, and were sampled by the excavation of shovel tests
placed at 30-meter (98.43-foot) intervals. These shovel tests extended to a depth of 1 meter
(3 feet) unless saturated soils prevented further excavation. No archaeological resources
where identified in any of these high probability areas. The lack of archaeological resources
in these areas can probably be attributed to the overall low topographic relief of the areas
within the study corridor that lie adjacent to the creeks. Much of the land within the high
probability areas was identified as wetland and lacked landforms suitable for human
utilization. As a result, although higher-relief landforms were observed to either side of the
proposed ROW and workspace areas, soils likely to contain deeply buried archaeological
deposits were not observed in the current projectâs APE.
During this investigation, archaeological remains or features were not located within
the project area. HRA Gray & Pape recommends that no further archaeological work is
required, and that the project be cleared to proceed as planned.
