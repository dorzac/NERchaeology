Researches in Coahuihecan Ethnography1
BY RUDOLPH C. TROIKE

THE TERM "Coahuiltecan" is applied ethnologically tO a number of
linguistically related bands of nomadic hunting-and-gathering Indians who ranged through southern Texas and northeastern Mexico
until the beginning of the 19th century. They belonged to the area referred to by Swanton (1940) as the "ethnographic sink," which was
inhabited by groups with relatively simple, subsistence-oriented cultures. Due to the extremities of their environment and the limitations
of their technology, the Coahuihecans were obliged to spend most of
their time in search of enough food to a11ow of bare survival. They had
to move frequently as the available food resources were exhausted
quickly in any one locale. As a result their inventory of material culture items was largely restricted to what they could easily’ carry with
them.
The entry of Spanish missionaries, settlers, and soldiers in the area
had an enormous impact upon the Coahuiltecans. Those who survived
European diseases, forced labor, and war were gradually Mexicanized
and were largely assimilated by the end of the 18th century.
Except for the work of Anderson (1932), archeological interest in
the Coahuihecan area has been rather recent and excavation has been
limited to only a few places. Sites in this area are usually campsites
which were apparently occupied only for short periods of time, and
material remains are scanty, so that excavation does not yield very
rewarding results. The work of Krieger (Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks
1954: 134-143) at Falcon Reservoir and of MacNeish (1958) in
Tamaulipas has added a great deal to our knowledge of Coahuiltecan
archeology, but much remains to be done before an integrated pictm’e
can be drawn.
Archeology and ethnology often complement one another in the rei I should like to express my appreciation to my wife, Nancy P. Troike, for her
assistance in the translation of the Spanish passages and for the preparation of the
manuscript.

construction of extinct cultures. Archeology provides information
about aspects of a people’s culture or way of life often omitted from
the best contemporary accounts. On the other hand, archeological interpretations of cultural materials often depend upon extrapolation
from ethnographic data, which also tell of many non-material or
perishable cultural features not preserved in the archeological record.
Unfortunately, information on Coahuiltecan culture is quite limited
since few Spanish writers considered it worthy of remark. Consequently almost any observation on Coahuiltecan customs by a contemporary source, no matter how brief, is of interest and value.
The principal sources on Coahuiltecan ethnography, Alonso de
Le6n (1909) and Vicente Santa Maria (1930), have been available
in published form for some time, and the information which they
and a few others recorded has been thoroughly analyzed (Ruecking
1953, 1954a, 1954b, 1955). However, a small amount of additional
information is to be found in scattered notes among civil and ecclesiastical documents preserved in various archives in Mexico. Considering
the fragmentary nature of the materials and the time and difficulty
required to uncover them, it seems desirable that such data be translated and published in full so as to make them freely available to other
workers in the field. The following notes concern just such material
and help to supplement the information on the Coahuiltecans provided by De Le6n and Santa Maria.
Ruecking (1955: 370) has observed that polygamy is frequently
mentioned in early historic accounts, but the specific form is rarely
indicated. It should be noted that De Le6n (1909: 52) describes both
the sororate and levirate, as well as an unusual marriage involving
both mother and daughter:
They do not observe degrees of affinal relationship, [and] of consanguinity, very few; they are accustomed for an Indian to have a daughter and
mother at the same time, and two or three sisters and other very close
[female] relatives, without scruple or novelty, and also those women
whom his brothers have had, the same law running for the [women] as
for the [men].
Ruecking (1955:381) has found that among the published sources,
"Nearly all Spanish authors say that the Coahuiltecans had no deities."
The following excerpts from two reports on the missions of San Antonio, Texas, provide a little additional information on the subjects of
marriage and beliefs and give very explicit references to the presence
of polygamy, the levirate, and belief in some sort of supreme being in
Coahuiltecan culture.

Those who come married from the hills are ratified [in] the [marriage]
contract (leaving only one woman to those who bring several) before
their baptism; and the Christians are married in due time by the Church
and in the conformance with the Holy Council of Trent. (A.G.N., Ramo
Historia, Vol. 28, Expediente 7, p. 174r, dated March 6, 1762.)
The most light that these barbarians have in their gentile state is that
there is a great thing [which is] author of all things. They observe that
the brother inherits the wife of another brother, [whether] she has children or not. They observe nothing in the affinal relationship; and too
much in that of consanguinity for permitted sexual unions, [but] of illicit
[unions] no account is made. In all other things they are like blank tablets~ and, once pacified, one can imprint upon them any aptitude, since
for all [things] they have skill. (A.G.N., Ramo Historia, Vol. 28, Expediente 12, p. 202r, year 1740.)

A few additional inferences may be drawn from the confessional
written in Coahuilteco by Bartholomfi Garcla (1760: 15-16, 78, 81).
He gives questions for asking whether a person has had sexual relations with near or distant relatives. Apparently the number of illicit
(in Spanish eyes, at least) sexual relations a person might have could
become so great as to be wearisome to inquire after, so he also provided a blanket question for all cases. It is especially interesting to note
that the Coahuilteco terms given for "concubinage" (as it is expressed
in Spanish) have the same linguistic form as the kin-terms for steprelatives. The Coahuilteco terms may be translated therefore as "stephusband" and "step-wife," thus perhaps revealing something of the
native attitude toward such relationships (although the possibility
should not be ignored that these were compounds invented by Garcia
to explain the Spanish concept to the Indians).
Also, in the marriage ceremony, Garcia inserts questions as to
whether either one of the couple have had sexual relations with relatives of the other, giving as examples the man with the older sister
of his bride or the woman with the younger brother of the groom.
These various questions suggest that restraints upon sexual relations
even within the kin group were not very strong, but the limits are not
clearly defined, for De Ledn and the San Antonio records disagree on
the respect accorded consanguinal kinship. However, it must be remembered that these accounts differ in time and in the area and
groups concerned.
The use of "sign language" among the Coahuiltecans in the San
Antonio missions is attested by one source.

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

Although there are many languages in these five missions, the most common are four .... The language of using only signs is universal in all of
the nations, [being used for] making long discourses of whatever intent,
as if it were any other language that is pronounced. We availed ourselves
of this at the beginning because of not having other means and totally
lacking interpreters for many [languages]. (A.G.N., Ramo Historia, Vol.
28, Expediente 12, p. 204f, year 1740.)

Ruecking (1954b) has pointed out that local bands of Coahuiltecans
were organized into larger groupings which he has called "bandclusters," one of which he has called the Carrizo cluster (1954b: 8-9).
He infers that the Cadima band was dominant in this cluster, and locates the cluster between the Nueces River in Texas and the Rio San
Fernando in Tamaulipas. He lists 51 bands in the cluster. New light
is shed on this group by a document written in Linares, Nuevo Ledn,
and dated March 29, 1732, in which Fray Juan Lozada relates his
efforts to secure peace with the Indian groups of that area.
The peace agreements being now concluded, I sent three Indians of the
mission of San Christoval with word to the nations that live on the bar,
near the sea (which seems to be the Sound), [of] which [nations there]
are several, giving them special charge that they, the questioners, visit
in passing an Indian [who is] general of twenty-six nations named Pedro
Botello, [that] they insinuate to him on my behalf the matter referred
to (with the Zirnas), and that they bring me a report of everything ....
[Botello replied to them:] "Do not forget that I already have sent memorias to Father Lozada with the Canaynas Indians, and they have not
informed me. See, I am Captain-General of all these nations--Cadimas,
Pelones, Nazas, Pamoranos, Quedejefios, Palmitos, Pintos, Quiniguanos,
Maquiapemes, and others--and I govern all [these] and they are at my
orders!" (A.G.N., Ramo Historia, Vol: 30, Expediente 15, pp. 199r, 2001-.)

These new data permit some revisions in Ruecking’s discussion of
the Carrizo cluster, while at the same time confirming his inference
that the Cadima band was the dominant group. From the foregoing it
is evident that in 1732 this band-cluster contained only 26 bands and
was situated toward the Gulf coast east of Linares, near the Rio San
Fernando. It is uncertain to what time-period Ruecking’s data relate,
but at least for the situation described in 1732 his list must be shortened considerably and the territorial extent of the cluster reduced.
However, the Pelones, Palmitos, Quiniguanos, and Maquiapemes
must be added to his list. Of these, he does not assign the Palmitos to
any band-cluster and the rest are not given in his general list of bands.
Unfortunately, it is not possible to determine which bands from the

305

COAHUILTECAI~ ETHNOGRAPHY

list of 51 were members of the cluster and which were not. Since the
Cadima band is given prominence in this cluster, it would seem preferable to re-name it the Cadima cluster, especially since the term
Carrizo seems to have been used for groups living along the Rio Grande
(Saldivar 1943: map). The amount of power claimed by Botello over
the bands of this cluster is somewhat surprising and unexpected, but if
true, provides a significant expression of an important feature of
Coahuiltecan political organization.
Documents from the archives of Monterrey, Nuevo Ledn, provide
some of the earliest information about native groups in that area.
These data are scattered sparsely through legal documents dealing
with land grants and other matters. One claim to an encomienda of
Indians contains information of considerable interest (A.A.C.M.,
Legajo 5, Expediente 11, year 1662). Sebastian Garcia claimed that
some of the Alazapa Indians living on the hacienda of Pedro de la
Garza belonged to him. He secured testimony from various old people
that these Alazapas had originally lived in two rancherlas, one of
which was named Catomao’ (meaning "large prickly pears") and the
other, Estequenepo’ (or Estequenego’). The Catomao’ band was said
to have been named for its headman of that name. Each rancheria had
its separate leader, but both spoke the Alazapa language.
Originally the two groups had lived near one another, on the two
crests of a sierra by a large river. They were said to have come together "at the time of the tuna"--when the prickly pear ripened-and for dances (ceremonial mitotes) and wars "which some Indians
are accustomed to have with others." At these times many other
rancherias united with them in one place. When tunas were not available they went up in the Sierra to drink agua mid, a beverage obtained
from the agave plant. A census of the Catamao’ rancheria is given,
containing demographic data which is unique for this area and very
valuable in giving a picture of the actual make-up of a Coahuiltecan
band with regard to size, composition of households, etc.

It is, of course, impossible to estimate what effect years of Spanish
contact had already had on the aboriginal situation. However, it
would be quite significant for the analysis of Coahuiltecan culture,
demography, and ecology if other such records could be discovered and
published.
A few band-names of the Borrado Indians are given with Spanish
-translations (A.A.C.M., Legajo 5, Expedientes 8 and 9). These groups
lived in the Sierra de Tamaulipas and in the basin on the west.
Xinipiguara small thickets.
Opaguiguara--marsh. They lived in a marsh with many reeds between the Pablillo and Potosi rivers.
Caguiraniguara--little painted birds. They lived along a stream which
ran and made pools and had many reeds.
Curya.capo, Cruyacapa, Cuiya.capa--large mountain near running
water.
Cuya.capo--water inside the mountain.
Passa, Guiguara--painted like chapules (dragon-fly).
Passa Guaniguara--painted like chapules (dragon-fly). This probably refers to a distinguishing tattoo mark used by the band (cf.
Ruecking 1955: 358-361).

Other Borrado bands mentioned without translation were the Guaripa
.and the Mohiguara. The latter were said to have joined with the Xinipiguara in dances and to have spoken the same language. It is also
.evident from the records that intermarriage occurred between these
-two bands. One case involved the daughter of such an interband marriage. The father was a Mohiguara and went to live with his wife
who was a Xinipiguara. Subsequently their daughter was kidnapped
during a mitote and taken to the Mohiguara rancheria, where she was

COAHUILTECAI~ ETHNOGRAPHY

307

put to work in the kitchen of the hacienda owner. The judgment ordered her returned to the hacienda where the Xinipiguara lived, on
the grounds that "the children follow the nature of the mother"
(A.A.C.M., Legajo 5, Expediente 9, p. 23f, year 1661 ).
Both the decision of the case and the residence of the man in his
wife’s rancheria strongly suggest a matrilineal-matrilocal organization in contrast to the patrilineal-patrilocal character of all Coahuiltecan groups for which information is available (Ruecking 1955: 367373). However, the location of the Borrados near the border of the
Huasteca suggests that their unexpected possession of these social patterns could be due to diffusion from the Mesoamerican area.
The use of peyote as a narcotic by the Coahuiltecans is known from
several sources (see Ruecking 1954a: 336-337). Morfi (1950:311 ) in
1777 visited the Misi6n del Dulce Nombre de Jesus de Peyotes near
Villa Uni6n, Coahuila. He explains the unusual appellation of the
mission as follows:
It is called "of the Peyotes" for a plant named thus, in which the land
abounds, as useful for various medicinal uses as pernicious for the Indians,.
who are accustomed to derive from it a sort of drink or beverage of much
vigor and strength, [and] by its use in dances and merriments deprive
themselves of reason and judgment.

He aso notes (ibid.) that the dominant Indian group in the mission was
the Sijame band, whose name meant "fish," and that their name was
extended to all of the other bands there.
Garcia (1760: 15) mentions the use of peyote in his confessional,.
along with several other questions of interest:
Have you eaten human flesh?
Have you eaten peyote?
Did it intoxicate you?
Have you eaten fri]olillo2
Did it intoxicate you?
Have you danced the raitote2

This reference to fri]olillo, or mescal bean, is one of the earliest references known to the use of the seed of the Texas Mountain Laurel
(Sophora secundiflora) as a narcotic. The juxtaposition of the two~
questions about peyote and mescal beans seems to be a strong indication of their contemporaneous usage by the Coahuiltecans (see Campbell 1958: 156-160). It may be inferred also that the consumption
of human flesh, peyote, and fri]olillo were associated with the cere-

TEXA~ ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

308

monial dances of the Coahuiltecans, as is known from other sources
(Ruecking 1954@. The native terms for peyote and fri]oliHo were
pa]e and samin, respectively (Oarcla 1706: I 5).
