MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

This report presents the results of a cultural resources survey conducted by Geo-Marine, Inc., for
Naismith Engineering, Inc., the city of Leakey, and the Nueces River Authority for the city of
Leakey’s proposed wastewater treatment facility site and associated wastewater transmission
lines rights-of-way in Real County, Texas. These investigations were conducted to provide data
for use in the management of cultural resources in partial fulfillment of obligations under Section
106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (P.L. 96-515), as amended, and other
cultural resources legislation. As the proposed project will take place on property owned by the
city of Leakey and involve funds from the Texas Water Development Board’s Economically
Distressed Areas Program, these investigations were conducted in accordance with the National
Historic Preservation Act and the Antiquities Code of Texas under Antiquities Permit No. 5174.
Located along the upper reaches of the Frio River, the project area coincides with the confluence
of the East and West Frio rivers on the north and the confluence of Flat Creek and the Frio River
to the south. This survey encompasses a 194-acre (78.5-hectare) area for the siting of the
wastewater treatment facility and a linear right-of-way of 35 feet (10.7 meter) in width along a
final proposed length of approximately 18 miles (29.0 kilometers) for associated wastewater
transmission lines. This length excludes previously surveyed portions of the original project area
that are no longer within the proposed transmission corridors, although these areas are discussed
in this report where appropriate. Prior to fieldwork, cultural resources investigations included
reviews of background literature, archeological and historical site records, and previous
archeological surveys conducted in the area. Fieldwork investigations consisted of a combination
of reconnaissance and intensive archeological survey techniques. Fieldwork for this project was
initially conducted in the spring of 2009. Results of fieldwork activities have been previously
reported and a memorandum among the Texas Historical Commission, Naismith Engineering,
and Geo-Marine was established in November 2009. The memorandum served to address
comments regarding inconsistencies in the design of the proposed project between the cultural
resources survey draft report submitted by Geo-Marine and the environmental assessment draft
report submitted by Naismith Engineering. An additional function of the November 2009
memorandum was to provide recommendations to the Texas Historical Commission and
Naismith Engineering and to facilitate compliance with National Historic Preservation Act and
the Antiquities Code of Texas through the duration of the project. Specific recommendations of
the memorandum include reconnaissance survey of the entire project area, intensive archeological
iii

survey of areas deemed to have a high probability for preserving cultural resources, deep testing
via backhoe trenching adjacent to major drainages and at the proposed locations of lift stations,
and archeological scraping and trenching within the proposed project area in the vicinity of the
Leakey-Floral Cemetery. Fieldwork to fulfill the recommendations outlined in the memorandum
was conducted in December 2010 and an addendum reporting the results of that fieldwork was
submitted in September 2011.
The results of this cultural resources survey include:
(1) the recording of four newly identified archeological sites (41RE124, 41RE125, 41RE126,
and 41RE127)
(2) revisits and updated information for two previously recorded archeological sites (41RE48
and 41RE106)
(3) the documentation of 18 isolated occurrences of past cultural activities
(4) an assessment of this project’s potential impacts on the historic Leakey Floral Cemetery
(5) an assessment of this project’s potential impact upon the archeological sites recorded
within the proposed right-of-way
All archeological sites, as recorded during this survey, were found to lack the necessary integrity
and research potential required for their inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places or
for designation as a State Archeological Landmark. It is recommended that this project will not
pose any adverse effects to archeological or historic sites in the vicinity of the proposed project
area. No evidence of unmarked graves was found within the project area adjacent to the historic
Leakey-Floral Cemetery. Several areas for proposed lift stations were not accessible to fieldwork
due to the lack of landowner permission. It is recommended that these areas be subjected to
intensive archeological survey prior to ground disturbing activities or be removed from the
proposed project area. All materials generated from these investigations will be housed at the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at the University of Texas at Austin.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

This report presents the results of a cultural resources survey conducted by Geo-Marine, Inc.
(project #30522.00.03), under subcontract to Naismith Engineering, Inc., for the city of Leakey
and the Nueces River Authority. Located along the upper reaches of the Frio River, the project
area is centered on the city of Leakey and extends from the confluence of the East and West Frio
rivers south to the confluence of Patterson Creek and the Frio River (Figure 1). The proposed
project encompasses a 194-acre (78.5-hectare) area for the wastewater treatment facility and a
right-of-way (ROW) of 35 feet (ft; 10.7 meters [m]) in width along a final proposed length of
approximately18 miles (mi; 29 kilometers [km]) for associated water and wastewater
transmission lines. This length excludes previously surveyed portions of the original project area
that are no longer within the proposed transmission corridors, although these areas are discussed
in this report where appropriate. These investigations were conducted to provide data for use in
the management of cultural resources in partial fulfillment of obligations under Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (P.L. 96-515), as amended, and other cultural
resources legislation. Since the proposed project will take place on property owned by the city of
Leakey and involve funds from the Texas Water Development Board’s Economically Distressed
Areas Program, these investigations were conducted in accordance with the National Historic
Preservation Act and the Antiquities Code of Texas under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 5174.
The purpose of these investigations was to determine the presence/absence of archeological
resources (as defined by 36 CFR 800.4) and to evaluate identified resources for their eligibility
for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), as per Section 106 (36 CRF
800) of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, or as a designated State
Archeological Landmark (SAL) under the Antiquities Code of Texas (13 TAC 26.12). These
investigations consisted of reconnaissance survey of the project area, intensive survey of areas
deemed to have a high probability for preserving cultural resources, deep testing via backhoe
trenching adjacent to major drainages, and archeological scraping and trenching within the
proposed project area in the vicinity of the Leakey-Floral Cemetery.
This cultural resources investigation included reviews of background literature, archeological and
historical site records, and previous archeological surveys conducted in the area prior to
fieldwork. Fieldwork investigations consisted of a combination of reconnaissance and intensive
archeological survey techniques. Reconnaissance survey field methods consisted of the visual
1

inspection of exposed ground surface and erosional profiles in areas of previous disturbance with
a low probability for the preservation of cultural resources. Intensive survey field methods were
reserved for areas yielding surface artifact assemblages and areas with the potential to contain
undisturbed subsurface remains. Intensive survey techniques included the systematic excavation
and documentation of shovel tests, mapping of surface artifact concentrations, and backhoe
trenching. Soil profiles of shovel tests and backhoe trenches were individually documented, and
artifacts encountered in shovel tests were collected for analysis.
Melissa Green served as Principal Investigator throughout the process of this investigation.
Fieldwork for the treatment plant site was directed by Clayton Tinsley. Jamie Vandagriff, John
Comer, Jay Smith, Steve Dunn, Nick Coleman, Matthew King, Olga Torres, and Matthew
Harwood provided in-field assistance for these investigations. At the completion of this project,
all material generated from these investigations will be housed at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) at the University of Texas at Austin.

CHAPTER 2
NATURAL ENVIRONMENT

The project area occupies the upper reaches of the Frio River canyon in southcentral Real County,
Texas. The majority of the project area is situated on the floodplain and terraces of the upper Frio
River in the Balcones Canyonlands of the Edwards Plateau escarpment. The project area roughly
coincides with the confluence of the East and West Frio rivers on the north and the confluence of
Flat Creek and the Frio River to the south (see Figure 1). The parent materials of the area soils
are predominantly gravelly alluvium from the Frio River with some in situ soil development
derived from the residuum of the underlying carbonate geology. The Frio River and the Balcones
Canyonlands support a diverse biotic community characterized by oak-juniper savanna in the
uplands and hydrophilic vegetation along major stream courses.

GEOMORPHOLOGY
Real County is located within the Edwards Plateau physiographic region of Texas. This region is
characterized as a dissected plateau underlain by the limestones, dolostones, and marls of the
Lower Cretaceous Glen Rose Formation. The project area is situated within the Balcones
Canyonlands, colloquially known as “Hill Country,” a dendritic network of steep-sided valleys
dissecting the otherwise flat-lying Edwards Plateau by erosion and solution due to high-gradient
streams originating as springs near the plateau’s escarpment. Primarily occupying the floodplain
and terraces of the Frio River (Figure 2), the proposed wastewater treatment facility and
associated transmission pipelines will occupy topographic elevations ranging from approximately
466–506 m (1530–1660 ft), with slopes ranging from 0 to 20 percent.

HYDROLOGY
The project area is located in the headwaters of the Frio River, part of the Nueces River Basin,
with its northern terminus at the confluence of the East Frio River and West Frio River, and
extends southward along both sides of the river, terminating to the south of the confluence of the
Frio River with Flat Creek. Numerous small-order drainages have eroded steep-sided valleys as
they extend from the higher elevations of the Edwards Plateau escarpment to the Frio River,
creating a dendritic pattern of ephemeral, intermittent, and perennial streams (see Figure 2).
Ephemeral and intermittent streams and springs are quite common in the area. Leakey Springs,
5

located 0.5 km (0.3 mi) east of the city limits of Leakey, represents one of a number of active
springs in the area. The Frio River, as well as Patterson Creek and Flat Creek, receive baseflow
from these springs of the Edwards aquifer, typically flow after rainfall, and often abandon
overland flow as they infiltrate the ground surface into underground conduits.

SOILS
Eight soil complexes and three soil series (Table 1; Figure 3) have been identified within the
proposed Leakey Wastewater Treatment Facility project area (Natural Resources Conservation
Service 2009). The soils mapped in the upland settings of this area are typically shallow with a
petrocalcic horizon, with deeper, gravelly soils occurring in alluvial settings. Soil textures range
from clays to very gravelly and cobbly loams and are well drained. These soils are derived either
from the alluvium of the Frio River or from in situ weathering of the underlying carbonate
bedrock of the Cretaceous-age Glen Rose Formation. Information presented here regarding the
soils of the project area has been synthesized and summarized from information provided by the
Soil Conservation Service and the Natural Resources Conservation Service.

Dev-Riverwash Complex (DeB): The Dev-Riverwash soil complex represents an intricate pattern
of very gravelly loams of the Dev soil series associated with gravelly alluvium occupying areas
immediately adjacent to high-velocity streams and rivers that drain the limestone hills of the
Balcones Escarpment. These soils typically exhibit an A horizon with a value ranging from 3 to 5
and a chroma of 2 or 3. The texture of the fine-earth fraction ranges from loam to clay loam and
may contain up to 90 percent coarse fragments in some areas. The B horizon has a hue of 10YR
or 7.5YR, a value of 5 to 7, and a chroma of 2 to 4. Texture of the fine earth fraction ranges from
loam to clay loam with a clay content of 18 to 35 percent and sand size particles primarily of
limestone. Secondary calcium carbonate deposits range from 0 to about 5 percent by volume.
Periodic catastrophic floods deposit most of the coarse fragments, which are mainly of limestone,
and smaller floods are responsible for the deposition of clay and silt-sized particles. Although
well-drained, these areas are often flooded, especially after precipitation.
Rio Frio-Vanderpool Complex (RfB): The Rio Frio-Vanderpool soil complex is an area of
interspersed ochric soils of the Rio Frio series with the mollic soils of the Vanderpool series.
Both of these series consist of potentially very deep, well-drained, moderately permeable soils
formed in loamy alluvium on nearly level to gently sloping stream terraces on the point bars of
stream meanders. A typical soil profile for this series exhibits an A horizon with a hue of 10YR,
a value ranging from 3 to 6, and a chroma of 2 or 3. The texture is typically loam or clay loam.
Calcium carbonate may occur in very minor amounts in the lower part of the A horizon. The Bk
horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, a value of 4 to 7, and a chroma of 2 to 4 with a texture of
loam or clay loam. In some areas the lower part of the horizon contains up to 50 percent
limestone pebbles and calcium carbonate concretions.
Nuvalde Clay Loam (NuB): Nuvalde clay loam consists of very deep, well-drained, moderately
permeable soil that formed across nearly level stream terraces in fine alluvium produced by both
overbank flooding and alluvial fans. The A horizon exhibits a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR with a
value of 4 or 5, and a chroma of 2 or 3. The texture of the upper horizon may range from clay
loam to silty clay. The underlying Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, a value of 4 or 6, and
a chroma of 2 to 4. The texture of the Bw horizon ranges from silty clay loam to clay with a total
clay content ranging from 35 to 50 percent and calcium carbonate accumulations accounting for
15 to 25 percent of the volume. The Bk1 horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, a value of 5 to 7,
and a chroma of 3 or 4, with a texture similar to the Bw horizon with up to 30 percent visible
carbonates.
Oakalla-Dev Complex (OdA): The Oakalla-Dev complex consists of intermingling areas of soils
of the Oakalla and the Dev series. The Ap and Ak horizons of the Oakalla series have hue of
10YR, a value of 2 to 5, and a chroma of 1 to 3 while texture ranges from loam to clay. Bk
horizon of the Oakalla series have hues of 10YR, values of 3 to 6, and chromas of 2 to 4 with
textures ranging from loam to silty clay loam. Dev soils typically exhibit an A horizon with a
value ranging from 3 to 5 and a chroma of 2 or 3. The texture of the fine fraction ranges from
loam to clay loam and may contain up to 90 percent coarse fragments in some areas. The B
horizon has a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, a value of 5 to 7, and a chroma of 2 to 4. Texture of the
fine fraction ranges from loam to clay loam. This complex consists of very deep, well-drained,
moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium of high-velocity streams or rivers on nearly
level to gently sloping floodplains and low terraces. These soils formed in areas that are subject
to flooding by overflow from streams for short periods after heavy rains.

9

Campwood-Knippa Complex (CkB): Soils of the Campwood-Knippa complex consist of very
deep, well-drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous clayey alluvium on nearly
level to gently sloping stream terraces and alluvial plains. These soils often exhibit an A horizon
with a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3 with textures ranging from
silty clay loam to clay, with clay contents ranging from 35 to 55 percent. The Bw horizon has
hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, a value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3 with textures of silty clay or clay
most common. Campwood soils often have a Bss horizon with a hue of 5YR to 10YR, a value of
4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4 while Knippa series soils often exhibit Bk horizons with hues of
10YR to 5YR, values of 6 to 7, chroma of 4 to 6, and consist of up to 40 percent calcium
carbonate by volume.
Mailtrail-Meretta Complex (MmC): The Mailtrail-Meretta complex consists of shallow soils over
a petrocalcic horizon. The A horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, chroma of 1 to
3, and caliche, limestone, and chert fragments ranging from 35 to 85 percent by volume. The fine
fraction is typically loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam. Bw horizons have hues of 5YR to 10YR,
values of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4 while textures range from silty clay loam to clay.
Fragments of cemented calcium carbonate dominate the matrix just above the petrocalcic horizon.
These soils are well drained and moderately permeable. They were formed in loamy sediments
on high terraces and alluvial fans.
Pratley clay (PtB): The Pratley clay consists of very fine-grained soils that are moderately deep
over a petrocalcic horizon. This is a well-drained and moderately slowly permeable soil that is
rarely flooded. The A horizon has a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, values of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or
3 with textures ranging from clay loam to clay. Bw horizons have hues of 5YR or 7.5YR, values
of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. This soil has the potential for argilliturbation due to high
smectite content. Soils of the Pratley series formed in clayey pedisediments over the interbedded
carbonates of the Glen Rose limestone.
Leakey silty clay loam (LkB): The Leakey silty clay loam consists of well-drained, very slowly
permeable soils that formed in fine-grained alluvium. This soil is moderately deep over a
petrocalcic horizon and forms on stream terraces. This soil has the potential for argilliturbation
due to high smectite content. The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR with values of 2 to 4, and
chroma of 1 or 2. Textures range from silty clay loam to clay. Bss horizons exhibit hues of
2.5YR to 7.5YR, values of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4. Bk horizons, where present, have hues
which range from 2.5YR to 7.5YR, values of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4. Coarse fragments
range from 1 to 60 percent by volume and appear to be remnants of a degraded petrocalcic
horizon.
Real-Oplin Complex (RaF): Soils of the Real-Oplin complex are composed of very shallow to
shallow, well-drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in residuum derived from weakly
cemented (in the case of Real series soils) to indurated (in the case of Oplin series soils)
carbonate deposits of the Glen Rose Formation. The A horizon exhibits hues of 7.5YR or 10YR,
values of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3. These very gravelly or flaggy clay loams tend to occupy
upland slopes where flooding does not occur.
Kerrville-Real Complex (KrD): The Kerrville-Real complex consists of the ochric Kerrville soils
interspersed with the mollic soils of the Real series, described above. The Kerrville series
component of this complex tends to be slightly deeper than those of the Real series component.
The A horizons of Kerrville series soils have hues ranging from 2.5Y to 10YR, values of 5 to 7,
10

and chroma of 2 to 4. Kerrville series soils are moderately deep, well-drained, moderately
permeable soils that formed, like the Real series, in residuum over interbedded carbonate deposits
on upland slopes.
Eckrant-Rock Outcrop Complex (EcG): The Eckrant-Rock Outcrop complex consists of very
shallow to shallow, well-drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in residuum over
interbedded limestone, marls, and chalk of the Glen Rose Formation. The thin A horizons range
in hue from 7.5YR to 10YR, with values of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. These thin upland soils
have slopes ranging from 20 to 60 percent and often co-occur with outcrops of the underlying
bedrock.

FLORA AND FAUNA
The environs encompassing the project area consist of an array of subhumid terrestrial
communities. The Balcones Canyonlands are located within the Balconian biotic province (Blair
1950) that represents an ecotone between adjacent biotic provinces. As such, this area once
supported a diverse range of fauna including bison, pronghorn antelope, gray wolf, mountain lion,
and black bear. From a vegetation perspective, the area can be generally described as a juniper­
oak-mesquite savanna. The Frio River supports a diverse biotic community, characterized by
hydrophilic vegetation that includes bald cypress, American sycamore, and black willow
occurring along major stream channels. It is likely that these species have persisted as relics of
moister, cooler climates following the Pleistocene glacial epoch. Native vegetation on the stream
terraces includes live oak, mesquite, pecan, agarito, green condalia, persimmon, ashe juniper,
curly mesquite, and various forbs and gramminoids. In the uplands, the vegetation regime
includes live oaks, ashe juniper, mesquite, Texas persimmon, flameleaf sumac, mountain laurel,
guajilo, algerita, pricklypear, red grama, threeawn, curly mesquite, and various forbs and
gramminiods.

CLIMATE
The project area lies at the interface of two climate zones: the subtropical subhumid and the
subtropical steppe (Larkin and Bomar 1983). The weather typically consists of hot summers with
arid to semi-arid conditions and short dry winters. Average annual precipitation measures
approximately 71 centimeters (cm; 28 inches [in]), with slightly more rainfall in the spring and
fall months. The average summer high temperature is around 33° Celsius (C; 91° Fahrenheit [F]),
and the average winter high temperature is 15.5°C (60°F), with winter temperatures seldom
dropping below 0°C (32°F).

CHAPTER 3
CULTURAL CONTEXT

The following chapter presents a brief synopsis of Native American cultural chronology and the
Euro-American history of Central Texas and the Balcones Canyonlands, based on the regional
archeological record. Given the size of the region and the depth and breadth of cultural
complexity that has developed in the area, this chapter must necessarily be limited in scope.
References are provided to supplement the information summarized here.

NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY
The following discussion of the prehistoric archeological record of Central Texas draws from
previous summaries by Black (1989), Collins (1995, 2004), Prewitt (1981, 1983), Suhm (1960),
Suhm et al. (1954), and Weir (1976). Central Texas contains an archeological record
representing the entire North American cultural sequence with evidence of human occupation
spanning a time period of roughly 12,000 years. A generalized cultural sequence for the Central
Texas archeological area is outlined in Table 2, and individual periods of the chronology are
presented separately in the subsequent discussions.

Paleoindian
Although human occupation of the New World prior to 10,000 B.C. has long been suggested
(Adovasio et al. 1990; Dincauze 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990; Meltzer 1989, Waters
and Stafford 2007), this evidence was not widely accepted until the recent finds at the Monte
Verde site in Chile, which yielded compelling evidence for human occupation of the New World
prior to 12,000 years ago (Collins 1997; Dillehay 1989; Dillehay and Collins 1988). Such
occupation within Central Texas has been proposed at several sites, namely Friesenhahn Cave
(Kreiger 1964), Hitzfelder Cave (Givens 1968), Levi Cave (Alexander 1982), and the Waco
Mammoth site (Fox et al. 1992). However, none of these proposed sites have been supported
with sufficient evidence to garner general acceptance among the archeological community
(Collins 2004:116). Because the evidence for such occupation remains disputed, the Paleoindian
period remains the earliest recognized human habitation in Central Texas.

The remains of the Paleoindian culture are common in Central Texas, relative to many other areas
of North America. The vestiges of Paleoindian habitation are preserved at sites such as Kincaid
(Collins et al. 1989), Wilson-Leonard (Collins 1998), Pavo Real (Collins et al. 2003), Gault
(Collins and Brown 2000), and the Levi Rockshelter (Alexander 1963). Excavations at these sites
reveal much information about the lifeways of these early people and, upon correlation with data
recovered at other Paleoindian sites in the southern United States, begin to illustrate the adaptive
behaviors of these people living at the end of the Pleistocene glaciation.
The Paleoindian stage in Central Texas (9500–6800 B.C.) falls into early and late subperiods. The
defining Paleoindian trait is the fluted projectile point tradition. Projectile points of the
Paleoindian period were made from high-quality toolstone and indicate high technical skill in
flaking, exhibiting a hallmark “flute,” a long, shallow flake scar extending from the base toward
the tip of the point, on one or both sides. The Early Paleoindian subperiod is based on fluted
projectile point styles such as Clovis, Folsom, Llano, and Plano. These style intervals are not
unique to Central Texas, for their ranges extend into the Southwest and Great Plains.
Cooler, wetter conditions prevailed 12,000 years ago, and although a general drying trend
continued through Paleoindian times, climatic conditions were more stable than during the
subsequent Holocene. The Paleoindian culture is often characterized as one of small but highly
mobile bands of foragers who were specialized hunters of Pleistocene megafauna. Most
Paleoindian sites are deeply buried and difficult to find, leaving the highly visible, often
fortuitously discovered, mammoth kill sites as the primary evidence of Paleoindian lifeways.
Recent studies address this bias, emphasizing that large kills probably contributed little to overall
food requirements and that a primary reliance on other game animals and plant resources was
likely (Ferring 1989). Subsistence in this period certainly included large herbivores such as
mammoth, bison, and horse, but was probably based more consistently on smaller animals such
as various species of turtle, land tortoise, alligator, mice, badger, and raccoon (Collins et al. 1989;
Story 1990) and presumably also included an array of plants (Collins 1998).
By about 11,000 years ago the cool, wet climatic conditions of the Pleistocene had given way to
Holocene warming and drying. This change brought about the extinction of Pleistocene
megafauna (possibly with the assistance of human hunters) and is concurrent with the earliest
record of the Folsom complex. The Folsom complex is best known for a projectile point, the
Folsom point (Largent et al. 1991). The Folsom point is the showpiece of one of the most
technically refined lithic technologies in human history. Shorter than Clovis points, “classic”
Folsom points exhibit fine parallel flaking and large flutes that extend across most of each face.
Midland points, although commonly believed to occur later in time, may represent unfluted
Folsom points, made to offset the production risks involved in fluting (Amick 1995). Another
trademark of the Folsom complex is the association of Folsom points with the remains of nowextinct bison (Bison antiquus), usually found in the context of massive bison kill sites. Such sites
are conspicuous, and thus much of what is known about Folsom subsistence and technology
comes from lithic artifacts found at these sites or nearby processing sites. Folsom tool kits
included the fluted Folsom and the thin, unfluted (Midland) points, large thin bifaces, and end
scrapers, all tools that were more conducive to the specialized hunting of Bison antiquus (Collins
1995:382).
By approximately 10,000 years ago, the climate trended toward more moderate conditions, and
the larger megafauna from the Early Paleoindian subperiod were no longer available. Most of the
associated faunal evidence dated to the Late Paleoindian period reflects a human subsistence
15

pattern based on smaller animals and deer. Horn Shelter No. 2 located on the Brazos River in
Bosque County (Forrester 1985), Hinds Cave (Shafer and Bryant 1977) in Val Verde County, and
Wilson-Leonard (Collins 1998) in Williamson County have yielded subsistence data indicating
that the Late Paleoindian peoples were consuming a variety of vertebrate fauna.
The Late Paleoindian period is represented by a greater diversity of projectile points (e.g.,
Plainview, Angostura, and Golondrina), that, although retaining a lanceolate form, were unfluted.
In contrast to evidence from the Early Paleoindian period, Late Paleoindian period points are
associated with modern bison (Bison bison) and often occur as surface finds throughout Central
Texas. The Late Paleoindian period defies convenient labeling, exhibiting a unique blend of
lanceolate and stemmed points that appear to correspond with lifeways reflective of Archaic
period subsistence alongside Paleoindian mobility. Again, little is known about the period in
Central Texas, but toward the latter part of the Late Paleoindian period, lanceolate points began to
be replaced by stemmed points. Settlement-subsistence strategies probably more closely
approximated those of the Archaic period than the Early Paleoindian period. More diverse sites
are associated with this transition, including not only the mass bison kills, but also campsites and
residences. The characteristics of the Wilson, Golondrina-Barber, and St. Mary’s Hall
components are more Archaic-like in that burned rock features are found, although the features
are much smaller and contain less rock than the burned rock features in the subsequent Archaic
period.

Archaic
Toward the end of the Late Paleoindian period a great variety of projectile point styles began to
appear. The subsequent Archaic period (6800 B.C.–A.D. 850) is broadly characterized by
stemmed and side-notched dart points and by the appearance of ground and pecked stone tools.
The Archaic represents a more generalized style of hunting and gathering as a way of life, and the
subsistence pattern may have become more diffuse, reflecting a greater exploitation of local
environments as smaller game animals, fish, and wild plant foods increased in dietary importance.
Like their predecessors, Archaic peoples apparently continued to follow a nomadic way of life,
traveling seasonally to utilize different food resources in various localities (cf. Weir 1976).
The Archaic is generally divided into early, middle, and late subperiods (Black 1989; Collins
1995; Story 1985) based on diagnostic projectile point styles and associated radiocarbon assays
(Collins 1995). Interplay between influential factors of population increase and environmental
change toward greater aridity and climatic variability probably drove adaptive change throughout
the Archaic. The following discussion follows Story’s (1985) broader subdivisions of the Early,
Middle, and Late Archaic, although discussion of various phases within these periods by Prewitt
(1981) and Collins (2004) provides much of the information discussed.

Early Archaic
The most archeologically obvious changes from the Paleoindian to the Early Archaic (7000–6000
B.C.) are the shift from the lanceolate points of the Paleoindian tradition to stemmed and sidenotched dart points and the appearance of ground stone implements emblematic of the Early
Archaic period (6800–4000 B.C.). Three recognized point styles (Angostura, Early Split Stem
[Gower and Jetta], and Martindale-Uvalde) indicate that the makers tended to occupy the better­
16

watered eastern part of the Edwards Plateau (Collins 1998:65). Assemblages also include large
bifacial tools (Clear Fork and Guadalupe bifaces), manos, metates, hammerstones, burins, circular
scrapers, and a variety of smaller bifaces. Few burials have been assigned to this period (Prewitt
1981:77–79; Story 1985:34–35), and settlement/subsistence systems are “hypothesized to have
been diffuse, utilizing a variety of resources and frequently shifting the loci of subsistence
activities rather than intensifying the use of any specified resource” (Story 1985:39).
Projectile point types constitute the primary source of information about the Early Archaic, but
Prewitt (1981, 1983) uses point types to define four phases: Circleville, San Geronimo, Jarrell,
and Oakalla. This refinement is criticized by some as unsubstantiated since few intact sites are
known (see Black 1989:26; Black and McGraw 1985), but the tendency for many Early Archaic
sites to occur in the Balcones Canyonlands leads several researchers to infer that this area was a
refuge from drier conditions in Central Texas and on the coastal plains (McKinney 1981; Story
1985). Concentrations of Early Archaic sites along the southern and eastern margins of the
Edwards Plateau may be indicative of climatic conditions at the time, as these environments had
more reliable water sources and a diverse subsistence base. The margins of the Edwards Plateau
are ecotonal in character and may have provided reliable resources during times of environmental
stress (Story 1985:31, 34). Convincing paleoenvironmental data on the climatic conditions of this
period is nonetheless still lacking.
Early Archaic sites are small (Weir 1976:115–122), suggesting that populations were highly
mobile and population densities were low (Prewitt 1983:217). These sites are usually described
as open campsites (such as Loeve, Wilson-Leonard, Richard Beene, Sleeper, Jetta Court,
Youngsport, Camp Pearl Wheat, and Landslide) or lithic procurement stations. Only a few
campsites located in rockshelters (e.g., Kincaid Rockshelter) occur on the Edwards Plateau during
this period. The location of lithic procurement sites is determined by the natural distribution of
raw materials. Large and varied burned rock features (such as those at Sleeper, Camp Pearl
Wheat, Wilson-Leonard, Richard Beene) become common in the latter part of the Early Archaic,
and domestic structures at Turkey Bend Ranch (Lintz et al. 1995) and caches reported at Linder
(Brown 1985) are also known in the Early Archaic (Collins 1998:64). Fresh-water mussel, deer,
and small game appear to have been important food resources. Hearths are occasionally found at
Early Archaic sites and can be stone-lined, basin-shaped, or flat. The appearance of ground stone
artifacts signifies a shift to plant resources, and the diversification of lithic technology appears to
reflect an increased reliance on gathering.

Middle Archaic
The Middle Archaic period (4000–2000 B.C.) in Central Texas exhibits more numerous and more
varied sites than the preceding Early Archaic. Such distinctiveness as an archeological region is
evidenced primarily by increased techno-stylistic diversity among projectile point types. This
cultural manifestation is characterized by a population increase; the development of regionally
distinct cultural patterns; and changes in settlement patterns, economic and social systems, and
technology (Prewitt 1981, 1983). In addition, territorial boundaries may have begun to emerge
(Story 1985:39).
Burned rock middens, often consisting of massive amounts of fire-cracked limestone, are,
however, the preeminent archeological features of the Middle Archaic period. Many of these
middens may represent earthen ovens used to process live oak acorns (Creel 1986; Weir 1976), as
17

well as to roast succulents or other plants and animals. Many types of trees disappeared from the
Central Texas paleoenvironmental record at this time, leaving live oak forests to dominate the
landscape. A renewed focus on deer, which themselves were well suited for the oak-savanna
environment, is likely. Weir (1976:124–130) suggests that an expansion of oak forests influenced
the development of an economic system that focused on the exploitation of deer, acorns, and
other hardwood nuts. Prewitt (1983:222–226) notes that the abundance of rock middens indicates
a greater reliance on plant foods, although tool kits still infer a strong dependence on hunting.
Middle Archaic sites in Central Texas are represented by rockshelters, campsites, lithic quarries,
and kill sites (Weir 1976), as well as the burned rock middens that first appeared toward the end
of the Early Archaic. Other features include basin hearths and large flat hearths. Data concerning
mortuary practices are not available except for the end of the Middle Archaic, during which
cremations have been reported (Prewitt 1981:81). Three general point styles comprise this
subperiod: Bell-Andice-Calf Creek, Taylor, and Nolan-Travis. Bifaces, a variety of scrapers,
unifaces, and grinding stones are also present. Prewitt (1981:73) suggests that the 50 percent
proportion of projectile points compared to total number of tools is indicative of a balance
between the exploitation of plant and animal resources.

Late Archaic
The Late Archaic period (2000 B.C.–A.D. 800) lifeways, initially very similar to those of the
preceding Middle Archaic, are characterized by the emergence of new cultural patterns as well as
the intensification of preexisting ones (Story 1985:45). Coastal marine shell, used either as
ornaments or as raw materials for ornaments, was exchanged with inland groups at least on a
limited basis in return for finished lithic tools and/or siliceous raw material (Story 1985:48). The
use of burned rock middens throughout the Late Archaic appears to have been a major part of the
subsistence strategy. A decrease in the importance of hunting, inferred by the low ratio of
projectile points in relation to other tools in site assemblages, may have occurred (Prewitt
1981:74). Bison, which had been absent from the area for most of the Archaic, were once again
available in the region (Dillehay 1974).
Late Archaic sites include rockshelters, campsites, and large cemeteries. The establishment of
these large cemeteries along drainages suggests strong territorial ties by certain groups (Story
1985:40). In addition to cemeteries (e.g., Orchard [41BX1]; Story 1985:49), isolated flexed
burials have been recorded for this period (Prewitt 1981:81–82). Features include basin hearths,
arcuate hearths, and mussel shell caches. The lithic assemblages contain a variety of dart point
styles (e.g., Bulverde, Pedernales-Kinney, Lange-Williams-Marshall, Marcos-MontellCastroville, Ensor-Frio-Fairland, and Darl); Erath, San Gabriel, and Hare bifaces; gravers;
scrapers; a variety of unifaces and bifaces; grinding stones; and boatstones. Except for Montell
and Fairland, the point styles for the Late Archaic are among the most widely distributed dart
points (Prewitt 1983). Other artifacts include ulna flakers, bone beads and awls, stone and marine
shell gorgets, and fresh-water mussel shell pendants (Prewitt 1981:81–82).

18

Late Prehistoric
The Late Prehistoric (A.D. 800–1600) was marked by the replacement of the atlatl-and-dart with
the bow-and-arrow technology. Ceramics were also adopted during this period. Basin-shaped
and flat hearths and burned clay/charcoal lenses and pits are the predominant archeological
features. Flexed and semiflexed burials, a continuation of Late Archaic burial practices, occur
near habitation sites, usually in cemeteries but also as isolated occurrences. Some burials were
cremations, carried away from cemeteries and placed in shallow pits. Rockshelter occupation
was more common. Two well-established phases comprise the Late Prehistoric: Austin and
Toyah. It is not known how these phases are related to previous groups, but Prewitt (1983:225–
228) has suggested that they might represent influences from the north. Whether these influences
represent an invasion of people or a transfer of ideas is unknown. It has been noted by previous
investigators (Decker et al. 2000; Huskey 1934; Shiner and Shiner 1977) that the upper Frio River
drainage lacks evidence for these most recent phases of prehistoric occupation. Whether this is a
result of sampling bias, abandonment of this area during the Late Prehistoric period, or failure of
archeologists to recognize the Late Prehistoric manifestations in this area is unknown.

Austin Phase
The diagnostic projectile points of the Austin period (A.D. 800–1300) are Scallorn and Edwards.
A wide variety of tools are found at Austin period sites, including Friday bifaces and unifaces,
other bifaces, scrapers, ground stone, ulna flakers, and bone awls. Other artifacts include painted
stones, bone beads, and marine shell beads and pendants. Projectile points are proportionately
more common during the Austin phase, as hunting appears to have become increasingly
important. The widespread occurrence of Scallorn points outside of Central Texas and the
frequency of marine shell indicate a broad cultural entity and/or extensive trade networks in the
Late Prehistoric.

Toyah Phase
Toyah phase sites (A.D. 1300–1600) are characterized by Perdiz and Cliffton points and the
presence of ceramics. Subsistence strategies shifted even further toward hunting in response to
the reoccupation of Central Texas by bison (Dillehay 1974). The importance of bison to the
Toyah economy is readily deduced from the makeup of artifact assemblages represented at a
number of archeological sites. The Buckhollow site produced an abundance of Perdiz arrow
points (Johnson 1994). Also found were Harahey knives, the majority of which exhibited four
beveled edges. This use wear is representative of cutting bison hides and flesh—a hypothesis
supported by the recovery of large numbers of bison bones. In addition, indicative of the
importance of bison is the recovery of large end scrapers from the site. The presence of edge
rounding and polish on bit ends indicates use on fresh hides, most of which were probably bison
(Johnson 1994). Specialized hunting adaptations are evident from the archeological materials,
though a broad subsistence base of fish, softshell turtle, aquatic birds, and mussels was also
exploited. Deer figured prominently in the overall assemblage, with bison and pronghorn
antelope also contributing a significant portion to overall subsistence (Black 1986). Artifacts
reflecting the Toyah phase include scrapers, beveled knives, and mussel shell pendants, as well as
bison bone tools, beads, and awls. Perishable artifacts such as cordage and basketry are found at
some sites. Corncobs have also been recovered, indicating either trade relations with agricultural
19

peoples or some degree of horticulture (Prewitt 1981:74). Extensive trade relations are also
indicated by the presence of Caddoan ceramics, such as Leon Plain and Doss Redware among
other imported types. Toyah phase burials sometimes contain artifacts, but it is not established
that these are grave goods. Perdiz and Cliffton points found in burials may be from fatal wounds
and indicative of increased conflict.

Historic Period
The most radical cultural changes among Native American groups in Central Texas occurred
during the Historic period (post-A.D. 1528), which is characterized by the appearance of and later
domination by Europeans as well as the migrations of nonlocal groups such as the Tonkawa,
Lipan Apache, and Comanche into the area. A detailed summary of historic period Native
American populations in Central Texas can be found in Hester (1989:77–84), and Campbell
(1979) and Campbell and Campbell (1985) provide more in-depth ethnographic evidence.
Although possibly initially contacted by Spaniards in the early 1500s, the culture of the
indigenous Native American populations in Central Texas probably did not change until the late
1600s when Spanish missions were founded and pressure from nomadic Native American groups
forced local groups to seek protection at these missions. After A.D. 1700, many traditional stone,
bone, and wooden items were replaced by European metal, glass, and cloth articles and by guns.
Eventually, the traditional cultures of the local populations collapsed. European-introduced
diseases had a devastating effect on local groups. After the introduction and diffusion of the
horse onto the Plains, nomadic raiding groups from the north and west (initially the Apache,
followed by the Comanche) forced most local groups to abandon much of the area by A.D. 1750.
Most groups were simply destroyed by the combined effects of the nomadic raiders and the
foreign diseases introduced by the Europeans. Today, the only Native American group who has
claimed Central Texas ancestry is the Tonkawa, although descendents of some of the groups that
sought refuge in the Spanish missions claim ancestry but are not federally recognized (Black
1989:33).

EURO-AMERICAN HISTORIC-ERA CHRONOLOGY

Spanish Colonization (A.D. 1528–1803)
The initial Spanish presence in Texas began with the arrival of Alonso Álvarez de Piñeda on the
Texas coast in 1519 to explore the coast of the Gulf of Mexico (Webb 1952:1:380). Attempts to
explore and colonize continued sporadically, and in 1528, Alvar Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca landed
accidentally on an island known to the Spanish as Malhado, possibly Galveston Island (Webb
1952:2:261–262; Winship 1990:1–4), when a boat he had been marooned on was driven ashore.
Several scholars have suggested that Cabeza de Vaca and his companions eventually traveled up
the Guadalupe or San Antonio River valley after leaving the coast and thus passed close to the
Balcones Canyonlands. Although their exact route is still in dispute, it is known that his small
group managed to cross the continental divide and in 1536 were met by Spanish slave catchers in
Sonora or Sinaloa, Mexico, and subsequently taken to Culiacan (Webb 1952:2:262–263; Winship
1990:1–4). Exploration of the region continued, but it was clear by the mid-1500s that there were
no golden cities or wealthy countries to conquer north of Mexico. Consequently, Spanish
20

expansion into the American southwest and Texas slowed, leaving Central Texas largely
unexplored until the late 1600s, when Alonso de León mounted various expeditions into Texas
between 1686 and 1690. In 1691, after Domingo Terán was appointed governor of the province,
he was accompanied by Padre Massanet to determine what French activities were occurring in the
region and to establish a series of missions among the Native Americans. In this pursuit, they
came into the region of San Antonio, both commenting on the fine plains and large numbers of
buffalo they encountered (McGraw and Hindes 1987:64). Padre Massanet called the area “San
Antonio de Padua” in honor of St. Anthony of Padua and suggested that it would make a suitable
location for a mission (McGraw and Hindes 1987:64).
Activities in the region were curtailed during the Eleven Years’ War of Spanish Succession
(1702–1713); but when the Frenchman Louis Juchereau de St. Denis traveled over much of the
province undetected in 1714, the Spanish were galvanized into action. A series of missions was
planned throughout the frontier areas of New Spain. For example, in 1716, an expedition led by
Captain Domingo Ramón set out for East Texas to establish missions and a presidio, including
one at a site between the Red and Sabine rivers at Los Adaes (de la Teja 1988). In response to the
remoteness of the settlements in East Texas, the Spanish soon recognized that a “way-station”
was necessary to bridge the distance between the newly settled missions and San Juan Bautista on
the Rio Grande. The need for an intermediate location had been evident for some time, and
“Terán . . . considered the upper San Antonio River valley, with its abundant water supply, woods
and agricultural land, the ideal site for missions and towns” (de la Teja 1988:53). Of like mind
was Fray Antonio de San Buenaventura Olivares who had been impressed with the area during
his visit in 1709. Martín de Alarcón, who had been recently appointed governor to the province,
considered the opinions. It was decided that two missions were to be founded: one on the San
Antonio River and one on the San Colorado River, with the former established first. The viceroy
ordered not only missionaries and solders to populate the new missions, but settlers and families,
artisans, and livestock as well (de la Teja 1988:55).
On May 1, 1718, a group led by Alarcón and including Fray Olivares founded the Mission San
Antonio de Valero on San Pedro Creek, and on May 5, 1718, the presidio and the villa of San
Antonio de Béxar were established. Although ceremonially the city was founded in 1718, no
actual construction was begun until 1719 due to the lack of men and materials (McGraw and
Hindes 1987:66). In total, five missions were eventually built on the San Antonio River, all
within a 12-mile radius of the present city of San Antonio. During the early 1700s, population
growth was slow in the San Antonio area. By 1721, San Antonio had become a series of wood
and mud huts (jacales), typical of a Spanish frontier settlement. All settlers, both military and
civilian, were dependent on the garrison for defense, communications, and, initially, civil
administration. The missions of San Antonio attracted a variety of Indian groups, primarily
Coahuiltecan and Karankawan hunter-gatherers, during the mid 1700s, but also attracted Indians
of other origins, some of whom were fleeing Spanish disruptions in Nuevo León and other
regions of northern Mexico (Hester 1989:200). However, not all Indian groups were interested in
what the missions had to offer. Mission settlements were disrupted frequently from 1721 to 1749
by raiding Apaches. Even after a formal truce had been signed in 1749, thievery and limited
hostilities took place throughout the rest of the century (de la Teja 1988:61). Hostilities also were
occurring with various Comanche bands, who disapproved of the tentative link between the
Spanish and the Apache during the latter half of the 1700s.

21

In 1762, Mission San Lorenzo de la Santa Cruz (Tunnel and Newcomb 1969) was established in
the upper Nueces River valley for the Lipan Apache. With the hopes of ameliorating Native
American attacks and maintaining Spanish control of the frontier, the small mission was never
officially sanctioned and unsuccessful in converting the Lipan to Christianity. Though it was
successful in repelling repeated attacks by raiding Comanche groups, the mission was abandoned
after only nine years of occupation.
Outside political factors during the latter half of the eighteenth century had a great impact on the
region. The completion of the Seven Years’ War (1754–1762) and the signing of the Treaty of
Paris in 1763 resulted in the French and Spanish ceding most of the lands east of the Mississippi
River to England, and Spain acquiring the Louisiana Territory from France. This, of course, put
an end to the years of Spanish paranoia and called for a reassessment of the situation in New
Spain (McGraw and Hindes 1987:74). Local effects included the selection of San Antonio as the
new provincial capital. Political events continued to have a rapid impact on the region. The
Louisiana Purchase in 1803 brought about the establishment of a “no-man’s land” between the
Texas and Louisiana border. Both Spain and America were eager to avoid a costly war. The
Louisiana Purchase, however, did generate increased American interest in Texas.

Texas Independence and Statehood (A.D. 1803–1861)
As settlers began to move into Texas, they existed first under Spanish and then Mexican control
until the struggle for Texas independence in 1836. After achieving independence, Texas
remained a republic until December 29, 1845, when it traded its independence for U.S. statehood,
entering the union as the twenty-eighth state.
Permanent American settlement of the area encompassing the project area did not occur until
1856, when John and Nancy Leakey, accompanied by several other families, settled in the upper
Frio River valley. In 1857, the Bexar District of the General Land Office (GLO) surveyed the
upper Frio River valley (Figure 4), and the military post of Camp Wood was established in the
upper Nueces River valley, near the former site of Mission San Lorenzo de la Santa Cruz. By
1860, a settlement was also established downstream on the Frio River at present day Rio Frio.
Texas, however, did not remain a state for long. Sectarian politics escalated during that period,
and after the presidential election of 1860, Texans began to consider secession. On February 1,
1861, Texas became a part of the Confederate States of America.

Civil War and Antebellum Texas (A.D. 1861–1900)
With the succession of Texas from the United States came the abandonment of the military post
at Camp Wood, but American settlement in the area did not cease. Since Civil War aggression
never reached the Balcones Canyonlands, coupled with the general remoteness of the area, it is
unlikely that settlers endured additional hardships due to the war. Attacks by hostile Native
American groups, however, occurred several times between the early 1860s and the last recorded
raid, which was carried out on the McLaurin household in 1882. During this period, communities
continued to develop in the Balcones Canyonlands, and Edwards County was established in 1883,
with the town of Leakey serving as the county seat (Figure 5) from 1884 until 1891. Ranching,
agriculture, timbering, and hunting provided for the majority of the livelihood of these early

settlers. In 1887, kaolin deposits were discovered in the uplands between Leakey and Camp
Wood. The Leakey Kaolin Company was formed, but the mine was not operational until the
early twentieth century, and even then only briefly (Chiodo 1962).

Modern Texas (A.D. 1900–Present)
By the beginning of the twentieth century, the primary sources of income for the people of the
upper Frio River valley included the raising of hogs as well as growing cotton and corn,
supplemented by hunting during the winter months (Chiodo 1962). Plans to organize a new
county from parts of several existing counties (Edwards, Kerr, Bandera, and Uvalde) had existed
since at least 1909 (Figure 6). In 1913, Real County was established with the city of Leakey as
the county seat. Although ranching still plays an important role in the local economy, much of
the local income is now derived from ecological tourism and hunting leases.

METHODOLOGY

The cultural resources survey recorded in this document was designed to identify both prehistoric
and historic archeological sites as well as important architectural cultural resources located within
the proposed project area. This work was undertaken with two primary management goals in
mind:
1. To locate cultural resources occurring within the designated survey areas
2. To assess the significance of those resources in regard to their potential for inclusion in the
NRHP and for SAL designation
The first of these goals was accomplished by a program of background research, a combination of
reconnaissance and intensive archeological survey techniques, and the analysis of the artifact
assemblages recovered via these investigations. This chapter discusses the methods by which this
study was conducted.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS IN THE PROJECT AREA
A background literature review of the project area exemplifies how little is known regarding the
archeology of the upper Frio River valley. Two early excavations took place in the area. The
first was undertaken by William Vane Huskey at the Nelson site (41UV1) on the Frio River
northeast of Concan in 1934 (Huskey 1934). Huskey, an artifact collector from Camp Wood,
became a field assistant for James E. Pierce and A. T. Jackson of the University of Texas at
Austin during their field investigations in the Balcones Canyonlands. Huskey reconnoitered sites
primarily in the Nueces River valley in 1933 to provide Pierce with information on where to
focus his investigations. In 1934, Huskey excavated several sites in the Frio and Nueces river
valleys, including the Nelson site, reporting his findings back to Pierce. Though by today’s
standards these efforts were “little more than artifact mining operations” (Decker et al. 2000:44),
they are not completely without scientific merit (Decker et al. 2000:45). As Goode (1991)
indicates, Huskey was the first to realize that burned rock middens persisted into the Late
Prehistoric period (A.D. 800–1600) and that there was a relative lack of Late Prehistoric sites in
the Frio River valley as compared to the Nueces River valley (Huskey 1934). Furthermore, the
rudimentary projectile point chronology assembled by Huskey (1935) is not significantly
27

inconsistent with those outlined for the area later in the twentieth century by professional
archeologists (cf. Collins 1995).
The other early excavation conducted in the upper Frio River valley was carried out by Shiner
and Shiner (1977) of Southern Methodist University, who excavated a burned rock midden
(41RE69) along the East Frio River 5.2 km (3.2 mi) to the northeast of the project area. Based on
the distribution of artifact classes and feature types at the site, Shiner and Shiner attempted to
elucidate the structure of the midden and identify the locations of households within it. The
findings of this investigation, however, have been criticized as “fanciful” and akin to the
“incredible ideas advanced earlier in the century” (Decker et al. 2000:58).
To determine previous cultural resources survey efforts and the locations of previously recorded
historic or archeological resources within 1.6 km (1.0 mi) of the project area, the Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas online database of the Texas Historical Commission (THC) was
consulted and archeological literature relevant to the project area was reviewed. THC records
indicated that only two recent archeological surveys and several previously recorded
archeological sites and other cultural resources exist within 1.6 km (1.0 mi) of the project area
(Table 3).

Based on THC records, a prior cultural resources management survey coincident with the current
project area was conducted by SWCA Environmental Consultants in 2006. This survey was
undertaken in preparation for the widening of Ranch-to-Market road (RM) 337 east of Leakey.
One archeological site (41RE106) was discovered through these efforts, but the portion of the site
within that ROW was determined to be ineligible for inclusion in the NHRP and did not warrant
SAL designation (Houk and Carpenter 2007). SWCA Environmental Consultants also conducted
an extensive cultural resources survey for Hill Country Telephone Cooperative between June
2008 and December 2009 for the installation of fiber optic lines (Peyton 2010). A portion of
SWCA’s Zone 4 survey area coincides with the proposed project area, specifically portions of
Patterson Creek Road between the Wood Hollow subdivision and RM 337 and extending east
along RM 337 to Camino Alto. No cultural resources were encountered by SWCA’s survey
within the vicinity of the proposed project area.

28

Six previously recorded cultural resources exist within 1.6 km (1.0 mi) of the project area. These
resources (summarized in Table 3) consist of five prehistoric archeological sites (three prehistoric
burned rock middens with associated campsites [41RE48, 41RE49, and 41RE120] and two
prehistoric open campsites [41RE106 and 41RE121]), and the historic Leakey Floral Cemetery.
The archeological sites recorded for the upper Frio River valley have been reported by a
combination of professional and vocational archeologists. As with many of the archeological
sites in the region, very little is known regarding any of them.
The Carter site (41RE48) is a burned rock midden and associated open campsite recorded by
Robert “Skipper” Scott of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Fort Worth District, in
1983. The site was recorded as occupying an area of approximately 400 m (1,312 ft) by 47 m
(154 ft) along the terrace to the east of the confluence of the East and West Frio rivers. At the
time of its initial documentation, 41RE48 was recommended not eligible for NRHP inclusion.
Site 41RE49 is a prehistoric burned rock midden, possibly with an associated campsite. Located
on the east bank of the Frio River, approximately 6.4 km (4 mi) south of Leakey, it is a raised
circular area roughly 9 m (30 ft) in diameter situated on the second terrace, at a distance of about
100 m (328 ft) from the river. No eligibility recommendations were indicated on the site form.
Site 41RE106 was discovered by SWCA Environmental Consultants in 2006 during a cultural
resources survey conducted in preparation for the widening of RM 337 east of Leakey. The site
represents a prehistoric campsite situated on a terrace above an unnamed tributary of the Frio
River 0.6 km (0.4 mi) east of Leakey. The site form states that the portion of the site within the
investigated ROW retained little research value, and no further investigations were recommended
for that area.
The Frio Landing site (41RE120) is an extensive burned rock midden and campsite located on the
west bank of the West Frio River, just above its confluence with the East Frio River. This site
was recorded by Dr. Thomas Hester based on informant information from various artifact
collectors who have participated in the commercial artifact operation conducted at the site. The
Frio Landing site is thought to have been occupied for an extensive period of time, from the Early
Archaic (ca. 7000 B.C.) to the Late Prehistoric (ca. A.D. 1600), determined by the types of
temporally diagnostic projectile points recovered there by artifact collectors. This site is one of
only a few sites in the upper Frio canyon with deep deposits and a Late Prehistoric component.
The site form states that the research potential is uncertain, and because 41RE120 will probably
be destroyed by artifact collectors, no further investigations were recommended.
The Flatrock site (41RE121) was recorded in the summer of 2008 by a local member of the
Southern Texas Archeological Association. The site is a lithic scatter situated on a terrace east of
the Frio River and contains a suite of artifacts diagnostic of the Archaic period (6800 B.C.–A.D.
850). Based on landowner information, the deposits extend to depths of at least 1 m (3.3 ft). The
site form states that the site retains regional and project-specific research value, and because the
landowner wants to protect the site, no further investigations were recommended.
The Leakey Floral Cemetery is located at the intersection of Evergreen Street and RM 337 (6th
Street) in the city of Leakey. The cemetery was established in 1881 when Sara Catherine
McLaurin and Allen Lease were interred following the last documented Lipan Apache raid in the
Frio valley. Approximately 1,000 graves exist in the cemetery, representing the final resting
place of many of the area’s elected officials, community leaders, veterans, and early settlers,
including John and Nancy Leakey. This cemetery was granted a THC historic marker in 1988
(Figure 7).

SURVEY METHODS
This project consisted of the survey of roughly 194 acres (78.5 hectares) for the siting of the
proposed wastewater treatment facility as well as a 35.0-ft (10.7-m) wide linear ROW for a final
proposed length of 18 mi (29 km) of associated wastewater transmission lines (see Figure 1).
This length excludes previously surveyed portions of the original project area that are no longer
within the proposed transmission corridors, although these areas are discussed in this report
where appropriate. Based on background research, it was determined that areas with the greatest
probability of preserving intact cultural deposits are likely to be the floodplains of the Frio River
and other major drainages as well as the terraces directly adjacent to these drainages. Given the
variable amount of groundcover, the recent residential development in the area, and the nature of
archeological sites in the region, it was assumed that ground visibility in the project area would
be highly inconsistent, contingent on landform and amount of recent disturbance. The majority of
the proposed project area was surveyed at the reconnaissance level. Portions of the proposed
project area with a moderate to high probability of preserving buried cultural deposits were
30

intensively investigated to determine the presence of cultural resources by excavation of screened
shovel tests. In areas with the potential for deeply buried cultural deposits or unmarked historic
graves, backhoe scraping and trenching were used to sample areas to depths of 1.5 m to 2.2 m (5
ft to 7.2 ft).
Shovel test excavations consisted of hand-excavated units of 30–40 cm (12–16 in) in diameter in
10–20-cm (4–8-in) levels, with the excavated soil passed through a 0.64-cm (0.25-in) hardware
mesh screen to recover artifacts. Shovel tests were excavated to depths of 1 m (3.3 ft) or until an
obstruction such as fragipan, regolith, or bedrock was encountered. Along linear ROWs, shovel
testing was conducted in a single transect, following the path of the ROW. Spacing between
shovel tests along these linear ROWs was contingent upon the amount of ground disturbance and
the presence of bedrock exposed at the surface in any given area. In most cases, shovel test
intervals along the linear ROWs were judgmental and targeted undisturbed areas of soil. In the
78.5-hectare survey area for the wastewater treatment facility, shovel testing was conducted in
60-m (197-ft) intervals along transects placed 60 m (197 ft) apart. The location of each shovel
test was recorded with a submeter-accurate Trimble GeoXTTM global positioning system (GPS)
unit, and the exposed soil profile documented. Each shovel test excavation was backfilled upon
completion of the recording process.
Instances in which residential development or infrastructure resulted in disturbances to depths
likely to have destroyed any potential archeological deposits were noted on field maps,
photodocumented, and visually inspected. If artifacts were encountered via visual inspection of
these areas, then shovel tests were excavated to target the areas of least disturbance and to
investigate the potential for buried deposits. In these cases, if artifacts were recovered in the
excavation, then additional shovel tests were excavated in a systematic manner, usually in 5–20­
m (16–66-ft) intervals until two negative shovel tests or additional disturbances were
encountered. In undisturbed areas or areas where subsurface deposits were likely to exist, shovel
tests were excavated in regular intervals, typically 30–100 m (98–328 ft).

ARTIFACT TREATMENT AND ANALYSIS
All artifacts recovered during this survey were briefly examined, bagged, and labeled by
provenience in the field. Upon arrival at the Geo-Marine laboratory facilities in Plano, Texas,
artifacts were cleaned, inventoried, analyzed, and catalogued (see Appendix A). Each artifact
was thoroughly examined in order to identify and determine, to the extent possible, its function or
role and cultural or chronological affiliation within the identified contexts.

Prehistoric Artifact Analysis
All prehistoric artifacts recovered during these investigations consisted of lithic artifacts. The
major classes of prehistoric lithic artifacts encountered during fieldwork in the project area
consisted of chipped stone tools, lithic debitage, and thermally altered stone (i.e., burned or firecracked rock [FCR]). Artifacts identified in the assemblage consisted of chipped stone tools
(which include formal tools such as projectile points, bifaces, and preforms) as well as cores and
debitage (the waste material from stone tool manufacture and maintenance). All tools were
identified, when possible, to a type or style defined for the Central Texas area. Standard variables
(length, width, thickness, and raw material type) were recorded for each lithic artifact. Variables
31

recorded for debitage include size class, raw material type, debitage type (i.e., flake, flake
fragment, or shatter), amount of cortex (if present), and the presence or absence of heat treatment
or burning. Burned rock encountered during fieldwork was noted, but not collected.

Historic Artifact Analysis
The historic artifacts collected during the course of the current project were examined by
laboratory staff for particular attributes and diagnostic traits using morphological and/or
functional classification systems developed by South (1977). Analysis of the recovered materials
assigned artifacts to one of four primary categories—Activities, Architectural, Domestic
(including Furnishings), and Personal (see Appendix A). The Activities category includes
nonhousehold items, transportation items, farm-related equipment, tools, and firearms. The
Architectural category includes all items related to buildings such as brick, mortar, plaster, nails,
window glass, and electrical items. The Domestic category designation is used for items related
to food service (tableware) and food storage (including food preparation and tin cans); the
Furnishings classification, a subcategory of Domestic, encompasses household items such as
furniture, stove parts, and lamp glass. The Personal category generally contains items of
individual use such as clothing, buttons, shoes, dolls, and smoking pipes. Those artifacts such as
unidentifiable pieces of glass and metal that cannot be specifically placed in one of the above
major functional categories are classified as Indeterminate.

Artifact Data Base
Various observations for each artifact were recorded and entered into an ACCESS database on an
IBM network system. In addition, computer printouts of all data were compiled and archived
with the permanent project files. The raw data recovered from the artifact analyses are presented
in Appendix A at the end of the report. All artifacts and records generated from this project will
be permanently curated at TARL in Austin at the conclusion of the project.

ARCHEOLOGICAL SITE DEFINITION
An archeological site is typically considered to be a spatially discrete area containing cultural
resources. The definition of a “site” is therefore contingent on the basis of content and extent.
Content may refer to artifacts recovered from surface or subsurface contexts, architectural
features, or other manifestations of past human activity. The extent of a site is based on the
horizontal and vertical spatial arrangement of these cultural remains. When only surficial
materials are encountered, a site is defined as five or more cultural artifacts or features of at least
two different materials or functional classes located within the same vicinity (typically a 400-m2­
area [0.1 acre]); the extent of the surface material is then defined as the site boundary. When
artifacts are encountered in buried contexts, a site is defined within the extent of the culturally
positive excavations. In cases where a shovel test yields cultural materials, additional delineation
shovel tests are excavated to define the boundary of the site. Shovel tests used to define and
delineate the boundary of a site are typically placed at intervals of 1020 m (3366 ft), either in a
cruciform pattern or along a linear ROW around the positive shovel test until two negative shovel
tests, or the project area boundaries, are reached. In general, if two or more positive shovel tests
are encountered and contain at least five artifacts of at least two classes of cultural materials, a
32

site is then defined within the extent of positive shovel tests. In cases where artifacts are
encountered on the surface and within adjacent shovel test excavations, site boundary is defined
within the extent of both the surface artifact assemblage and the locations of positive shovel tests.
Cultural remains meeting these criteria are designated as a site, recorded on a Texas
Archeological Site Data Form, and submitted to TARL to be included in the Texas Archeological
Sites Atlas database. Conversely, the discovery of cultural materials that do not meet these
criteria are considered isolated occurrences of past human activity and are simply documented by
location and content; likewise, modern material representing an obvious single-event trash dump
is not considered a site, with only location and content documented.

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA

National Register of Historic Places
The assessment of significance of a cultural resources property is based on federal guidelines and
regulations. The criteria (36 CFR Part 60.4 [a–d]) for evaluating properties for inclusion in the
National Register are codified under the authority of the National Historic Preservation Act of
1966, as amended, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation has set forth guidelines to
use in determining site eligibility. Based Advisory Council guidelines, any resource that is
included in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register is a “historic property,” and based on
federal regulations, “[t]he term ‘eligible for inclusion in the National Register’ includes both
properties formally determined as such by the Secretary of the Interior and all other properties
that meet National Register listing criteria” (36 CFR §800.2 [e]). Subsequent to the identification
of relevant historical themes and related research questions, the following four criteria for
eligibility are applied:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design,
setting, material, workmanship, feeling, and association and
(a) that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of
our history; or
(b) that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
(c) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant
and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
(d) that have yielded or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history [36 CFR
Part 60.4 (a–d)].

The principal research objective is to determine whether a cultural resources property possesses
the potential to contribute to one or more of the above-defined criteria. Therefore, adequate
information on site function, context, and chronological placement from both archeological and,
if appropriate, historical perspectives is essential for cultural resources investigations. Because
research questions vary as a result of geography, temporal period, and project design,
determination of site context and chronological placement of cultural properties is a particularly
important objective during the inventory process. The objective of this current project was to
locate and define both horizontally and vertically any cultural resources, document and describe
those resources, and then, when adequate data were present, evaluate each for NRHP eligibility.
33

State Archeological Landmark
Under the Texas Antiquities Code, archeological sites may be considered significant at the state
level and be recognized or designated as an SAL, provided that at least one of the following
conditions is met:
(1) The archeological site is situated on lands owned or controlled by the State of Texas or one of its
political subdivisions; or
(2) The archeological site is situated on private lands that have been specifically designated as an
SAL . . . and fits at least one of the following criteria:
(A) Preservation of materials must be sufficient to allow application of standard archeological
techniques to advantage;
(B) The majority of artifacts are in place so that a significant portion of the site’s original
characteristics can be defined through investigation;
(C) The site has the potential to contribute to cumulative culture history by the addition of new
information;
(D) The site offers evidence of unique or rare attributes; and/or
(E) The site offers a unique and rare opportunity to test techniques, theory, or methods or
preservation, thereby contributing to scientific knowledge [Texas Natural Resources Code
1977; Title 9, Chapter 191, Texas Antiquities Committee, Section 191.094 and Chapter
41.7, Antiquities Code of Texas].

If a property is owned by the city or county, it technically meets SAL Condition 1 regarding
political subentities of Texas. At issue, however, is whether a site meeting that criterion is
significant and eligible for designation as an SAL or for inclusion in the National Register. The
principal research objective at the survey level of investigation is the determination of whether a
cultural resources site possesses the potential to make a contribution to one or more of the
aforementioned criteria. The objective is to determine which cultural resources could yield
further data regarding regional, methodological, or theoretical research questions. Therefore,
adequate information on site function, context, integrity, and chronological placement from both
archeological and, if appropriate, historical perspectives is essential for cultural investigations.
Because research questions vary as a result of geography and temporal period, determination of
site context and chronological placement of cultural resources is a particularly important
objective during the inventory process.

CHAPTER 5
SURVEY RESULTS

This chapter presents the results of the survey, discusses cultural resources encountered
discovered during the course of this fieldwork, and assesses the effect of the proposed project on
these cultural resources. Management considerations and recommendations based on the findings
of this survey are presented in the following chapter.
BACKGROUND RESEARCH RESULTS
Few professional or academic archeological excavations have been performed in the area; the
most recent involved the excavation of a burned rock midden site approximately 5 km (3 mi)
northeast of the project area (Shiner and Shiner 1977). Review of THC records indicated that two
linear cultural resources management surveys have been conducted in the vicinity of the proposed
project area. SWCA Environmental Consultants conducted a survey in 2006, prior to the
widening of RM 337 (Houk and Carpenter 2007). Between June 2008 and December 2009,
SWCA Environmental Consultants conducted an extensive cultural resources survey for Hill
Country Telephone Cooperative for the installation of fiber optic communication lines (Peyton
2010). Portions of each of these surveys coincide with the proposed project area. Of the six
cultural resources recorded within 1.6 km (1.0 mi) of the project area (see Table 3), portions of
sites 41RE48 and 41RE106 occur within the project area, and the Leakey Floral Cemetery is in
proximity to it. Based on information regarding previously recorded archeological sites in the
area, prehistoric sites are likely to exist on the floodplains and terraces of the Frio River and its
major tributary drainages. Likewise, historic-period archeological sites are likely to exist within
the proposed project area.
CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY RESULTS
This project consisted of the cultural resources survey of approximately 194 acres (78.5 hectares)
for the siting of the proposed wastewater treatment facility as well as survey along associated
water and wastewater transmission lines within a ROW of 35 ft (10.7 m) in width along a final
proposed length of 18 mi (29 km). This length excludes previously surveyed portions of the
original project area that are no longer within the proposed transmission corridors, although these
areas are discussed in this report where appropriate. Fieldwork investigations consisted of a
35

combination of reconnaissance and intensive archeological survey. Much of the proposed
infrastructure related to this project, specifically the water and wastewater transmission lines, will
follow existing roads and utility corridors. The majority of the proposed project area has been
heavily impacted by residential and commercial development (Figure 8), and thus, much of the
project area had a low probability of preserving undisturbed cultural deposits. Over much of the
project area, bedrock was exposed at the surface, precluding the need for intensive survey (Figure
9). In many areas, ground surface visibility ranged from approximately 30–100 percent due to
the semi-arid conditions of the region and previous disturbances to vegetation and topsoil. The
high degree of surface visibility, coupled with the generally thin soils and shallow bedrock of the
project area, negated the need for intensive survey in these locations, and thus, systematic visual
reconnaissance was conducted. Intensive survey using shovel testing at systematic intervals was
conducted within Section A, which will be part of the proposed wastewater treatment facility, and
along Sherman Lane in Section E, situated between the Frio River and an unnamed tributary
flowing southward from Leakey Springs.

(Figure 10). The cultural resources encountered during this survey are discussed individually.

Section A
Section A consists of approximately 194 acres (78.5 hectares) proposed as the site of the
wastewater treatment facility and 0.8 mi (1.3 km) of linear ROW along Stamford Hollow Road.
This section spans the terraces of Patterson Creek west of its confluence with the Frio River and
is relatively undisturbed. The topography of this section is generally level with some gentle
slopes in the southwest portion. Area elevations range from 475–500 m (1,558–1,640 ft). The
northeastern corner of this section abuts Patterson Creek and an unnamed, ephemeral stream
drains the northwestern portion of the section into the creek. Soils in this area were highly
variable, ranging from the shallow gravelly loams of the Mailtrail-Meretta, Kerrville-Real, and
Real-Oplin complexes to the clays of the Pratley series. A structure is depicted within the Section
A survey area on the 1974 Leakey United States Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
(1:24,000-scale) topographic quadrangle. This structure consists of a ranch-style house
constructed in 1968. Due to its age, this structure was not evaluated. Along the southeastern
boundary of the section is a generally level portion of the terrace above Patterson Creek, near its
confluence with the Frio River (see Figure 1). Southwest of the Highway 83/Stamford Hollow
Road intersection is a pump station, owned and operated by the city of Leakey (Figure 11). Until
recently, a mobile home and an associated shed was also present at this location. The mobile
home was recently removed when the property was purchased by the Nueces River Authority. A
large depression, possibly a borrow pit or former stock tank location, is roughly 100 m south of
these structures.

In total, 219 shovel tests were excavated in this section, with the majority placed along transects,
and at 60-m (197-ft) spacing between excavations (Figure 12). Due to the discovery of historicperiod surface artifacts in the southcentral portion of the section, a testing interval of 10 m (33 ft)
was adopted until two negative shovel tests were encountered in each of the cardinal directions.
Based on the age, distribution, and frequency of artifacts recovered in this area, this historic
artifact scatter meets the requirements of the site definition and has been designated as site
41RE124. Additionally, because of the arid conditions, three historic-era isolated finds (Isolates
16–18) were exposed along the surface of Stamford Hollow Road. These cultural resources are
discussed in more detail later in this chapter.

Section B
Section B consists of 9.41 km (5.85 mi) of linear ROW encompassing the city of Leakey and
several outlying residential communities (Figure 13). This section spans the western terraces of
the Frio River, just south of the confluence of the East and West Frio rivers. The topography of
this section is generally level with elevations ranging from 475–536 m (1560–1760 ft). Soils in
this area range from the shallow gravelly loams of the Mailtrail-Meretta complex to the deeper
loams of the Rio Frio-Vanderpool complex. Most of this section was visually inspected and
photodocumented via reconnaissance methods. In total, 29 shovel tests were excavated in this
section, with the majority placed at 30–60-m (98–197 ft) intervals.

39

A surface concentration of prehistoric lithic artifacts was found in this section. Upon discovery
of this surface artifact scatter, a testing interval of 10 m (33 ft) along the linear ROW was
implemented until negative shovel tests or erosional disturbances were encountered. Various
lithic artifacts were recovered both on the surface and in subsurface testing in this area. Based on
the distribution and frequency of artifacts recovered, this prehistoric lithic scatter meets the
requirements of site definition and has been designated as site 41RE125. Two cultural isolates
(Isolates 1 and 2) were documented during the survey of Section B. These cultural resources are
discussed in greater detail below.

Section C
Section C consists of 6.81 km (4.23 mi) of linear ROW northeast of the city of Leakey along
private roads primarily within the Twin Forks subdivision (Figure 14). This section spans the
eastern terraces of the Frio River, just south of the East Frio River near its confluence with the
West Frio River. The topography is generally level, with elevation gradually increasing from
west to east. Elevations range from 482–512 m (1,581–1,680 ft). Soils in this area range from
the gravelly loams of the Dev-Riverwash complex to the silty clay loams of the Leakey series.
Much of this section was disturbed by impacts from residential development. Very few
undeveloped areas existed with the survey ROW, and 32 shovel test excavations were
judgmentally placed in accessible, undisturbed areas or where surface artifacts were present. The
remainder of this section was visually inspected and photodocumented via reconnaissance
methods. One structure of unknown age, indicated on the 1969 USGS 7.5-minute (1:24,000­
scale) Rio Frio topographic quadrangle, is depicted within the proposed project area near the
Twin Forks subdivision water treatment facility. Shovel tests excavated in the vicinity of the
structure encountered no cultural artifacts or feature. Cultural resources survey of this area
resulted in the documentation of seven cultural isolates (Isolates 3, 4, 1014), a revisit to a
previously recorded archeological site (41RE48), and the discovery of two new archeological
sites (41RE126 and 41RE127).

Section D
Section D consists of 9.44 km (8.87 mi) of linear ROW south of the city of Leakey and west of
the Frio River, following RM 1120 and Highway 83 (Figure 15). This section spans the western
floodplain and terraces of the Frio River, the confluence of the Frio River and Patterson Creek,
and the western terrace of Patterson Creek. The topography is generally level, with the most
topographic expression where the ROW crosses Patterson Creek and its associated terraces.
Elevations range from 463–494 m (1,520–1,620 ft). Soils consist predominantly of Rio FrioVanderpool complex loams and Campwood-Knippa complex clays and silty clays. Much of this
section is disturbed from impacts by residential development and road infrastructure. Very few
undeveloped areas existed with the proposed ROW, and in total, 14 shovel tests were
judgmentally placed in accessible, undisturbed areas. Backhoe trenching was conducted in
proximity to the Leakey-Floral Cemetery and the Frio River. The remainder of this section was
visually inspected and photodocumented via reconnaissance survey methods.

42

Backhoe Trenches 4 and 5 were excavated near the intersection of John Davis Road and FM
1120, just north of the Frio River, to determine the likelihood of deeply buried cultural deposits in
that area. Backhoe Trench 4 was terminated at 35 cm (14 in) below the surface when the base of
a modern road sign was encountered. Backhoe Trench 5 (Figure 16) revealed a dark yellowish
brown (10YR 3/4) gravelly clay loam to a depth of approximately 40 cm (16 in), overlying a dark
grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly clay loam with few subrounded to rounded limestone cobbles
to approximately 80 cm (32 in), where a thin (10 cm [4 in]) layer of partially decomposed organic
detritus separated it from the underlying reddish yellow (7.5YR 7/8) gravelly clay loam with
many subrounded to rounded limestone cobbles (see Figure 16). The water table was
encountered at a depth of approximately 180 cm (71 in) in this area.

A portion of the project area in proximity to the Leakey-Floral Cemetery was investigated via
archeological backhoe scraping and trenching to determine the potential for the presence of
unmarked historic-period graves within the project area (Figure 17). Two areas, measuring
approximately 2 m (6.6 ft) by 4 m (13 ft) and situated between the western edge of the pavement
of Evergreen Street and a buried fiber optic cable, were scraped in 5-cm (2-in) intervals to a depth
of approximately 50–60 cm (2024 in) below the ground surface to detect the presence of grave
shafts. Backhoe Trenches 6 and 7 were then excavated within the scraped areas to depths of 130–
150 cm (5159 in), where regolith was encountered. An additional backhoe trench (Backhoe
Trench 8) was excavated south of the initial two scraped and trenched areas. This area was not
scraped due to the steep slope caused by the Evergreen Street roadcut. Soil profiles exposed by
the backhoe trenches in this area generally consisted of a surface layer of very dark gray (10YR
45

3/1) clay loam with few subrounded to rounded limestone pebbles to a depth of 35 cm (14 in)
overlying a dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) clay loam with few subrounded to rounded
limestone pebbles to a depth of 110 cm (43 in). Finally, a strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) gravelly clay
loam mantled the underlying regolith. Regolith was encountered between depths of 130 and
150 cm (51 and 59 in) in these trenches. No evidence of graves or grave shafts was encountered
in any of the excavations conducted in this area.
One concentration of crushed or burned caliche was observed in the west profile of Backhoe
Trench 7 at a depth of 38–50 cm below surface (cmbs; 15–20 inches below surface [inbs])
(Figure 18). This concentration contained one wire nail, one colorless glass fragment, one
fragment of unidentifiable ferrous sheet metal, and one aqua glass bottle fragment. No other
artifacts were encountered within the trench. As this artifact concentration does not meet site
definition, it was documented as Isolate 15. These artifacts are probably related to road
maintenance activities during the early twentieth century when Evergreen Street was the primary
route south of Leakey.

Intensive survey investigations for a 0.5-km (0.3-mi) segment along John Davis Road between
RM 1120 and Highway 83 were restricted to a width of 7 m (23 ft) due to the placement of fences
immediately adjacent to the road and within the proposed ROW. The cultural resources survey of
this area resulted in the documentation of three cultural isolates (Isolates 5 [historic] and 67
[prehistoric]), discussed below.

47

Section E
Section E consists of 2.07 km (1.29 mi) of linear ROW east of the city of Leakey following RM
337 from Evergreen Street to Camino Alto (Figure 19). This section spans the floodplain and
terraces of the Frio River and the Leakey Springs tributary. The topography is generally level
and elevations range from 481–488 m (1,580–1,600 ft). Soils vary from the gravelly loams of the
Dev-Riverwash complex near the Frio River, the Oakalla-Dev complex and the Nuvalde clay
loam on the first terrace, and the Campwood-Knippa and Mailtrail-Meretta complexes on the
second terrace. Residential development is common along RM 337 and the roadway has been
extensively improved recently. Twenty-eight shovel tests and three backhoe trenches were
excavated in this portion of the project area.
Three backhoe trenches were excavated along the northern ROW of RM 337 in the vicinity of the
Frio River. These backhoe trenches encountered layers of light gray (10YR 7/2) and light
brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly and very gravelly clay loams with many subrounded to
rounded limestone cobbles (Figure 20). Two of these backhoe trenches (BHTs 1 and 2) were
excavated to depths of 2.2 m (7.2 ft) where excavation was terminated for safety reasons. A third
(BHT 3) was terminated at a depth of 1.5 m (4.9 ft) when the water table was encountered.
Previously recorded site 41RE106 was revisited during this survey effort and is discussed in
greater detail later in this chapter.

Section F
Section F consists of 4.8 km (3 mi) of linear ROW south of the city of Leakey and east of the Frio
River, following FM 1120 from Little Dry Frio Road to the Frio River and David Rankin Road
through the Oakmont Village subdivision and ascending the west slope of Saddle Mountain
(Figure 21). This section spans the eastern floodplain and terraces of the Frio River, and the
slopes of the adjacent uplands. The topography becomes increasingly steep, rising from west to
east, and elevations range from 465–527 m (1,525–1,729 ft). Soils vary from the gravelly loams
of the Dev-Riverwash complex near the Frio River to the clay loams of the Nuvalde and Pratley
series across the river terraces, and the uplands support the shallow, gravelly soils of the RealOplin and Kerrville-Real complexes. Rock outcrops are common on the steepest slopes of Saddle
Mountain. Residential development is widespread, which coupled with the thin soils has resulted
in the presence of exposed bedrock in many areas investigated. Much of this section was visually
inspected and photodocumented via reconnaissance methods, and 10 shovel tests were excavated
in areas that retained soil. The cultural resources survey of this area documented prehistoric
cultural Isolates 8 and 9 in this survey section. This area has since been removed from the
proposed project area.

Archeological Sites
Four new archeological sites—41RE124, 41RE125, 41RE126, and 41RE127—were documented
as part of this survey effort, and two previously recorded sites—41RE48 and 41RE106—were
revisited (Table 4). Additionally, the Leakey Floral Cemetery was assessed in relation to possible
adverse effects from the proposed project.

Previously Recorded Site 41RE48, Revisited
Site 41RE48 was first recorded by USACE archeologist Robert “Skipper” Scott in 1983 as a
prehistoric burned rock midden and open campsite on the terrace escarpment above the Frio
River, an area inspected while investigating a Clean Water Act violation. At the time of its initial
documentation, 41RE48 was considered to be not eligible for NRHP inclusion. The southeastern
portion of the site as originally recorded coincides with the area of potential effects (APE) of this
project, along a private residential road (Taff Place), located in the Twin Forks community in
survey Section C. Current testing along the adjacent Holmes Drive revealed an artifact
distribution that indicates 41RE48 extends over a larger area than that previously recorded, and it
is obvious that residential development in the area is responsible for exposing these artifacts,
providing evidence about the areal extent of the site not available to the previous investigator.
Presently, the roughly triangular-shaped site extends along the ROW for a length of
approximately 470 m (1,542 ft), which, based on the presence of artifacts in the ROW, extends
the original site boundary eastward to encompass a site area of approximately 165 m (532 ft)
east–west at the widest extent (Figure 22). This area occupies the terrace above the Frio River
and is composed primarily of Campwood-Knippa complex soils. These soils supported a native
vegetation regime of juniper with assorted forbs and gramminiods across the terrace and bald
cypress and other riparian hardwoods along the terrace escarpment; however, these have largely
been replaced with turfgrass and other ornamental plants. The terrace is generally level, with
elevations ranging from 487 to 490 m (1600 to 1606 ft).

Intensive survey, beginning at the end of Holmes Drive, resulted in several positive shovel tests
(STs 30–32) yielding lithic debitage (n=17), bifacial tools (n=2), and minor amounts of burned
rock. Adjacent to the proposed ROW, a surface artifact scatter was visible extending to the east
(see Figure 22). The extent of this area of surface artifacts could not be fully mapped because it
extended outside the ROW and into areas for which right-of-entry (ROE) had not been granted.
Continuing south along Holmes Drive and the proposed ROW, recent residential development
such as driveways, lawns, hedges, and drainage ditches were found to have disturbed the ground
surface to the extent that subsurface testing at regular intervals became an unreasonable means of
survey. For the remaining 0.3 km (0.2 mi) of Holmes Drive, the few remaining undisturbed areas
were targeted for testing. An additional six shovel tests were excavated, four of which were
positive for cultural remains. In addition, a scatter of lithic artifacts consisting of a core and
numerous large primary reduction flakes was observed approximately 3 m (10 ft) outside of the
eastern margin of the ROW in the vicinity of STs 36 and 37. This concentration of artifacts was
photographed and its location documented, but was not otherwise disturbed. Surface artifacts,
primarily cores and flakes, were also evident in the vicinity of STs 39 and 40.
In total, 12 shovel tests were excavated along Holmes Drive in the vicinity of 41RE48. Of the
recovered 67 total artifacts, cultural materials (n=66) came from seven shovel tests, but
numerous surface artifacts were observed in the immediate vicinity outside the ROW.
Recovered artifacts are lithics, all manufactured from Edwards chert (Table 5). The
assemblage is predominantly composed of debitage (n=60) exhibiting roughly equal amounts of
debitage (n=31) and shatter (n=28). Eight of these specimens were recovered from 20–40 cmbs
(8–16 inbs), but the majority came from the topmost of the upper 20 cm (8 in) of the
excavations. Most of the debitage reflect biface thinning efforts, and only three show evidence
of heating. One exhausted core (less than 50 millimeters [mm] in maximum dimension) was
collected from the site surface. Three tools were recovered from three different shovel tests, at
depths from 0–20 cmbs (0–8 inbs). A possible dart projectile point basal fragment,

with a finely worked straight or slightly expanding stem with a square base, came from ST 39,
and STs 30 and 32 each yielded a late stage biface. None of these tools exhibits heat treatment.
The remaining three artifacts are pieces of Edwards chert fire-cracked rock.
Conversations with property owners in the area indicated that artifacts have often been recovered
in the area between Holmes Drive and the previous boundary of site 41RE48 during various
residential improvement projects. It is likely that the site originally designated as 41RE48 is
much larger than previously documented and encompasses a larger area of the terrace. The area
is largely disturbed by residential development (Figure 23), as predicted by Skipper Scott when
41RE48 was initially documented, and it is this disturbance that has exposed many of the artifacts
now visible on the surface.
Unfortunately, none of the artifacts encountered during this investigation were temporally or
functionally diagnostic, thus determinations of site age, chronology, and function cannot be
addressed. Most artifacts encountered were on or near the surface, and in only a few instances
did artifacts occur deeper than 20 cmbs (8 inbs). The construction of Holmes Drive and the
numerous homes and residential infrastructure now present on the site has disturbed much of the
already shallow soil in this area, exposing artifacts and possibly obliterating any cultural features
that might be present. In one area outside of the ROW, a unifacial tool and debitage were
observed on top of organic debris shed by the surrounding juniper trees, indicating that sheet
erosion is also responsible for redepositing exposed artifacts. The portion of the proposed ROW
that coincides with the originally documented site, now in the vicinity of Taff Place, is
completely occupied by residential development.

Although undisturbed portions of the site might exist in undeveloped areas of the community, the
segment along Taff Place and Holmes Drive has been largely disturbed. No intact subsurface
deposits were encountered during these investigations, and much of the surface artifact
assemblage has been disturbed as well. The portions of site 41RE48 within the proposed project
area and its artifact assemblage lack integrity of association. Thus, it is recommended that the
portion of 41RE48 within the proposed project area is not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP
under the criteria enumerated in 36 CFR 60.4 or for designation as an SAL under 13 TAC 26.8.
Although the site area has been somewhat disturbed by development, the site extends beyond the
current project area and has not been thoroughly investigated. Thus, the site as a whole is
considered to be of unknown eligibility. The site portion within the APE would not affect the site
recommendation if the entirety of site 41RE48 were later determined eligible.
Previously Recorded Site 41RE106, Revisited
Due to the proximity and similarity of artifacts on the terrace west of the Leakey Springs tributary
of the Frio River along RM 337 to previously recorded archeological site 41RE106, it is assumed
that these cultural deposits represent a lateral continuation of site 41RE106 within an area not
accessible to the previous survey effort. Site 41RE106 was initially discovered during a cultural
resources survey carried out prior to the expansion of RM 337 (Houk and Carpenter 2007). The
site was characterized as a multicomponent site with a minimal artifact assemblage consisting of
several pieces of prehistoric chert debitage and thermally altered rock as well as a single historic
metallic artifact. Site 41RE106 was described as occupying the terrace escarpment above the
Leakey Springs tributary of the Frio River, extending approximately 90 m (295 ft) along the
southern ROW of FM 337. The site boundary was not fully delimited at the time of its discovery;
55

however, the portion of the site within the southern ROW of FM 337 was recommended as not
eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or designation as an SAL (Houk and Carpenter 2007:15).
Positive shovel tests were encountered during the current survey effort within the northern ROW
of RM 337 extending west from an unnamed intermittent drainage channel across the terrace at
an elevation of approximately 480 m (1,575 ft) above modern sea level (Figure 24). Fifteen
shovel tests yielded subsurface material from depths of 0–80 cmbs. Prehistoric (n=92) and
historic (n=1001) artifacts, as well as limited faunal remains and a vegetal sample, were collected
from site 41RE106. Historic artifacts are generally restricted to the eastern end of site, whereas
prehistoric artifact distribution is generally uniform across the site. Numerous modern intrusive
features are present and include RM 337, Fisher Lane, residential driveway structures, a drainage
structure and ditch, current and previous buried telephone lines, and a fence line (Figure 25). A
defunct telephone cable was encountered in two of the shovel tests excavated at the site at depths
of 52 and 55 cmbs.
Prehistoric material is composed almost exclusively of lithic tool manufacturing debris (n=89)
recovered from 15 shovel tests (Table 6). ST 86 yielded 26 percent (n=24) of the lithic
assemblage, with most material coming from the 0–40 cmbs levels. The majority of the debitage
raw material is Edwards chert; only one indeterminate medial/distal flake fragment is of quartzite.
Most of the debitage assemblage falls into the biface thinning flake (n=48) classification and was
recovered from 0–60 cmbs. Decortication flakes (n=8) and a single core flake as well as the 15
medial/distal flake fragments were found from 0–60 cmbs. Shatter (n=11) was recovered from 0–
40 and 60–80 cmbs in nine of the excavation units that contained prehistoric material. The five
small potlid fragments came from four shovel tests at depths of 20–40 cmbs. The core, also of
Edwards chert, was collected from 20–40 cmbs; the specimen weighs 103.8 grams (g) and shows
evidence of potlidding from a heating event. The last remaining lithic is an unusual piece of
unworked quartz crystal into the 19–25.4-mm size range recovered from a depth of 0–20 cmbs in
ST 86. Although it is unworked, this crystal is probably a manuport carried onto the site. No
culturally or temporally diagnostic prehistoric artifacts were recovered at site 41RE106, nor were
any intact prehistoric cultural deposits or features encountered. The prehistoric component of this
site may represent a short-term or seasonally occupied camp associated with a burned rock
midden purported by locals to exist approximately 46 m (150 ft) south of RM 337 on private
property (Houk and Carpenter 2007:14).
Site 41RE106 primarily yielded historic materials (n=1,001) that were recovered from both the
general site surface and 10 shovel tests (Table 7). ST 84 contained the majority of the historic
material (n=415, 41 percent), followed by STs 83 (n=186) and 85 (n=183), each yielding 19
percent.
Domestic artifacts (n=550) were the most common materials found onsite. Among the 37
ceramics are three pieces of porcelain (0–20 cmbs from STs 85 and 86); one fragment of pure
white ironstone (post-1890; ST 85, 0–20 cmbs); and one fragment each of Bristol interior/exterior
(post-1900; ST 85, 0–20 cmbs), Bristol exterior/natural clay slipped interior (1890–1915; ST 81,
40–60 cmbs), and natural clay slipped interior (1850–1915; ST 84). Five sherds of yellowware
(likely from the same vessel) were collected from ST 81 (n=1; 40–60 cmbs) and ST 82 (n=4; 20–
60 cmbs). Most of the ceramics, however, are whiteware (light blue tinted n=6, 1880–1930; pure
white, n=18, post-1890; one burned/discolored) fragments, of which four are rimsherds and two
are basal sherds with a footring. Whiteware ceramics were recovered from STs 81–86 (0–60
cmbs).

Domestic glass fragments (n=439) were by far the most common material onsite. Colors range
through amber/brown (n=66), aqua (n=18; one sherd with a continuous thread dating from 1905–
1935, and one with an Owens ring dating post-1910), ash tint (n=64; post-1915), clear (n=216,
post-1870; and five with maker’s marks dating variously from 1911 to 1964), cobalt blue (n=1),
Depression-era colors (n=1; 1920–1950), emerald green (n=2; post-1930), light green (n=7), light
tint (n=39; ca. post-1915), manganese/solarized (n=11; 1870s–1920), and milk glass (n=9; ca.
1880–1930). An ash tint and three clear fragments were collected from the site surface, but all
others were recovered subsurface from STs 81–87 (0–80 cmbs). The major portion of the glass
assemblage is from bottle glass, but nine fragments—jars or jar liner/lids (post-1870–1935; STs
82–86, 0–40 and 60–60 cmbs) and one possible piece of table glass (ST 85, 0–20 cmbs)—are also
represented. Domestic metal (n=54) is attributed to tin can crimped rims (post-1902) and can
fragments from STs 81–86 (0–80 cmbs). Materials falling into the Domestic subcategory of
Furnishings (n=18) are predominantly fragments of clear lamp glass (n=16; post-1880), but also
found were a cast iron possible stove part and a Bristol interior/exterior ceramic with an everted
rim, possibly from a chamber pot (post-1900).
Activities category material (n=25) consists primarily of metal fragments (n=21). ST 81 (20–60
cmbs) yielded a fence staple, and ST 82 (20–40 cmbs) contained a single piece of barbed wire
(post-1874) similar to Glidden’s Barb, One-Strand variation (Clifton 1970:31). ST 84 yielded a
possible cultivator part, a horseshoe nail, and a possible wagon part made from a thick bar with a
back curve, all from 0–20 cmbs; from 20–40 cmbs were two spring fragments, probably
originally one artifact; and from 40–60 cmbs was a fence staple. All metal material from ST 85
came from 0–20 cmbs: a can lid with rolled edges (post-1890), two possible end cap fragments

with small prongs on the bottom, a hacksaw blade, three probable machine parts (a hollow shaft,
a doughnut shaped object, and a slider possibly used with metal straps), a spring (post-1890), a
strap, and a wire bail handle. Metal from ST 86 consisted only of a fence staple (20–40 cmbs).
The three glass fragments assigned to Activities are from 0–20 cmbs: two pieces of an aqua
insulator (ST 83), and a clear glass fragment with an embossed vertical scale and the number
“40,” probably from a medicine bottle (post-1880; ST 84). A miscellaneous carbon battery core
was also recovered from 0–20 cmbs in ST 84.
Among the Architectural materials (n=74) are window glass fragments (n=55) recovered from 0–
80 cmbs from STs 81–86. Window glass colors are aqua (n=1), ash tint (post-1915; n=6), clear
(post-1880; n=24), light green (n=14), and light tint (n=10). Cut nails (1840–1880; n=7) came
from STs 83, 84, 86, and 91 (0–20 cmbs); and wire nails (n=9; post-1890) were recovered from
0–60 cmbs in STs 81, 83–86. Two washers, possibly used for attaching tarpaper, were recovered
in the upper 20 cm in ST 85, and a single machine-made brick fragment was retrieved from ST 94
(0–20 cmbs).
60

Personal items, rarely found on sites, are limited to a metal shoe eyelet from ST 84 (0–20 cmbs);
and from ST 86 (0–20 cmbs) an amber/brown snuff bottle fragment (post-1920,), a two-hole shell
button, and a clay marble. Artifacts categorized as Indeterminate (n=329) are functionally
unclassifiable and thus do not fit into any of the four major function categories (Activities,
Architectural, Domestic, Personal); these items consist of various pieces of glass (n=96), metal
(n=229), a piece of slate, and three fragments of modern plastic (1942–present, 40–60 cmbs).
The last of the historic material collected from site 41RE106 is a single piece of miscellaneous tar
recovered from ST 84 (0–20 cmbs), likely from road construction.
In addition to the prehistoric and historic materials, faunal material was recovered from two
shovel tests. ST 83 yielded four animal tooth fragments: a carnivore canine (2.5 g) and a
mammal tooth (0.4 g) from 0–20 cmbs; and two indeterminate animal tooth fragments (0.8 g)
from 20–40 cmbs. ST 84 contained five animal bone fragments: four unworked bone fragments
(0–20 cmbs; 3.8 total g); and an unworked deer size shaft fragment (20–40 cmbs) weighing 0.4 g
that shows evidence of green fracturing. Also collected from the site was a vegetal sample of two
pieces of charcoal recovered from ST 87 (0–20 cmbs).
The historic component of 41RE106 likely represents a farmstead that existed on the outskirts of
Leakey during the late nineteenth to mid-twentieth centuries. Primary structures are not depicted
at this location on either the 1927 USACE Bandera City 1:125,000-scale or the 1933 USACE
York Hollow 1:62,000-scale topographic maps nor are any recorded on Tobin or Army Map
Service aerial photographs from the early 1940s to the 1950s.
Given the minimal, fragmentary, redundant prehistoric artifact content and the lack of culturally
or temporally diagnostic artifacts or cultural features, the prehistoric component of the portion of
site 41RE106 within the northern ROW of RM 337 is considered to have little research potential.
As such, this portion of the site is not likely to preserve information important to understanding
prehistoric settlement and subsistence strategies along the Balcones Escarpment of Central Texas.
Likewise, based on the fragmentary and redundant nature of the historic component of the site
and the lack of additional features or architectural remains within the project area, the historic
component of the portion of site 41RE106 within the project area is considered to have little
research potential. This portion of the site is not likely to preserve information important to
understanding community and regional development in Real County during the late nineteenth to
early twentieth centuries. Thus, it is recommended that the portion of 41RE106 within the
northern FM 337 ROW is not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under the criteria enumerated in
36 CFR 60.4 or for designation as an SAL under 13 TAC 26.8. The site, however, likely extends
beyond the RM 337 ROW and has not been thoroughly investigated, and thus the site as a whole
is considered to be of unknown eligibility. The site portion within the APE would not affect the
site recommendation if the entirety of site 41RE106 were later determined eligible.
Site 41RE124
Site 41RE124 (Figure 26) represents a surface scatter of historic period artifacts. The site is
located along the southern margin of survey Section A approximately 0.6 km (0.4 mi) southwest
of the intersection of Stamford Hollow Road and Highway 83. This area occupies a portion of
the toe slope of the adjacent hills and is composed of gravelly clay loam of the Pratley series.
The area immediately surrounding 41RE124 is covered by sparse vegetation, primarily juniper
and prickly pear. Patterson Creek is located roughly 0.9 km (0.6 mi) to the northwest of the site.
The site extends south onto the adjacent property and covers approximately 1.6 acres (Figure 27).
The portion of the site within the project APE covers an area of approximately 0.86 acres.

This site was initially identified during intensive survey by the presence of a diffuse scatter of
historic artifacts on the ground surface encountered while excavating shovel tests on transects
across the survey area. Upon the discovery of the surface artifact scatter, shovel testing was
conducted in 10-m (33-ft) intervals across a grid oriented to the cardinal directions to delimit the
site boundary. All surface artifacts within 2 m (6.6 ft) of a shovel test were also collected, with
the exception of large metallic debris likely originating from agricultural activities at the site.
Access to the southern property parcel was revoked before the site boundary could be completely
delimited or the recovered artifacts could be formally analyzed.
In total, 115 artifacts were recovered at 41RE124 (Table 8). Due to very thin soils in this area,
surface artifacts (n=106) constitute the majority of the artifact assemblage from this site, with
only nine artifacts recovered from shovel test excavations (0–25 cmbs [10 inbs]). Artifacts
recovered at the site consist primarily of Domestic items (n=82), although Activities (n=3),
Architectural (n=7), Personal (n=4), and Furnishings (n=2) items are represented in lesser
amounts, along with 17 Indeterminate items primarily of unidentifiable thin metal likely related to
farming and ranching activities and one unclassifiable angular manganese/solarized glass
fragment. Some of these artifacts can be dated based on known dates of manufacture, but most
are of an indeterminate age. Domestic items comprise the largest artifact class at this site: glass
(n=50), mostly amber or brown (n=24) and manganese/solarized (n=15; manufactured from
1850–1920 [Lockhart 2006]) container glass, but also fragments of clear (post-1880), aqua, light
green, and olive bottle glass; ceramics (n=31), mostly whiteware (n=14; 1880–1930), with some
ironstone (n=9;1850–1910), porcelain (n=1), and stoneware (n=7; 1840–1915); and a metal spoon
or fork handle in two crossmending fragments. Activities items are represented by a carriage

bolt, a horseshoe nail, and a complete horseshoe. Architectural items (n=7) consist of several cut
nails (n=3; 1840–1880), fragments of window glass (n=3), and a piece of slate (n=1).
Furnishings include a fragment of lamp glass and a piece of metal that is possibly from a stove.
Personal items consist of four fragments of snuff bottles.
Based on this assemblage of artifacts, 41RE124 most likely dates to between 1880 and 1920.
Although some of the manufacturing date ranges are quite broad, details of some of the artifacts
narrow the usage to this period. For instance, the use of manganese as a decolorizing agent in
bottle-making was more prevalent from the late 1870s to just before and up to World War I
(Lockhart 2006:53–54). Likewise, ironstone became thicker, rather plainer, and more affordable
in its latter period of manufacture (Moir 1987:102; Wetherbee 1996:1), as noted in late
nineteenth-century and turn-of-the-century mail order catalogues (e.g., Sears Roebuck and
Company; Montgomery Ward & Company). The ironstone sherds recovered from this site fall
into this category: thick, plain (undecorated), and affordable. This date range also coincides with
the most active period of farming and ranching in the Frio River canyon, and the artifact
assemblage appears to reflect an association with such activities.
Site 41RE124 likely represents midden associated with a farmstead that existed on the outskirts of
Leakey during the late nineteenth to early twentieth centuries. No primary structures are depicted
at this location on either the 1927 USACE Bandera City 1:125,000-scale or the 1933 USACE
York Hollow 1:62,000-scale topographic maps; however, the Standford farmstead is depicted
near this location. An unimproved road is depicted on the 1933 York Hollow map as extending
from the south across the site area to the Standford farmstead. No structures are recorded at this
location on Tobin or Army Map Service aerial photographs dating between the early 1940s and
the 1950s. It is likely that the material remains preserved at site 41RE124 represent a dump or
midden related to the Standford farmstead or an associated tenant cabin that may have existed in
the vicinity.
Few such historic sites have been recorded by professional archeologists in the project area or in
the county in general. The research potential of 41RE124, however, is very limited. The extent
of archeological deposits at the site is confined to the surface, with very few exceptions. Since
the investigated site area within the ROW exhibits no discernable features or architectural
remains and the artifact assemblage is not extensive or diagnostic enough to contribute additional
64

knowledge of the historic period in the Frio River canyon, the portion of site 41RE124 within the
project area is limited. Thus, it is recommended that the portion of 41RE124 within the project
area is not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under the criteria enumerated in 36 CFR 60.4 or for
designation as an SAL under 13 TAC 26.8. However, since the site extends beyond the project
APE and has not been thoroughly investigated, the site as a whole is considered to be of unknown
eligibility. The site portion within the APE would not affect the site recommendation if the
entirety of site 41RE124 were later determined eligible.

Site 41RE125
Site 41RE125 (Figure 28) is a multicomponent site composed of a predominant prehistoric lithic
scatter component and a limited historic component. The site is located along Weston Road in
survey Section B approximately 110 m (361 ft) west of the intersection of Weston Road and
Leakey Springs Road. This area is on a portion of the terrace above the Frio River and is located
at the interface of the Rio Frio-Vanderpool complex and the Oakalla-Dev complex. The area
immediately surrounding 41RE125 is covered by vegetation, primarily juniper; however, much of
the immediately adjacent area is cleared pasture. The Frio River is located approximately 270 m
(886 ft) to the east of the site.

This site was initially identified during intensive survey by the presence of a scatter of prehistoric
lithic artifacts on the ground surface encountered while excavating shovel tests along the ROW.
Upon the discovery of the surface artifact scatter, shovel testing was reduced to 10-m (33-ft)
intervals. The site extends approximately 36 m (118 ft) along the ROW (Figure 29). On the
65

eastern margin, it is bounded by an ephemeral drainage. Artifact densities decrease across the
site from east to west, with the majority of the artifacts occurring within the 10 m (33 ft) nearest
the drainage. A large circular area of erosion in the center of the site is responsible for exposing
these artifacts. Approximately 15–25 cm (6–10 in) of soil has been eroded from this area and is
likely responsible for relocating artifacts. Five of the six positive shovel tests were excavated
along the ROW in this area. These shovel tests, coupled with mapping the surface artifacts
present, served as the basis for defining the boundary of this site within the project area. The site
likely extends both to the north and south of the transmission line ROW, but the scope of work
and ROE issues did not permit investigation of the adjacent areas.
The 14 artifacts recovered from the site consist of 11 prehistoric lithics and three historic
specimens. The historic material consists of two ceramics fragments, one of stoneware (1875–
1900) and the other a yellowware body sherd (1860s–1930s; Leibowitz 1985), collected from the
surface of STs 21 and 22, respectively, as well as a piece of light green bottle glass from ST 24
(0–20 cmbs [0–8 inbs]). Among the prehistoric lithics assemblage are five bifacially worked
chipped stone tools or tool fragments recovered through both surface collection and shovel test
excavation (Table 9). Two thin, finely worked biface fragments from the surface of ST 21 are
possibly from the same tool, likely a spear/dart point or knife based on the thickness of the
fragments, which measure 4.8 and 6 mm (0.19 and 0.24 in). Two large bifaces at varying stages
of manufacture were recovered as surface finds: one fragmentary biface approximating
Callahan’s (1979) Stage 2 and one complete biface conforming to Callahan’s Stage 3. The fourth
bifacial tool, recovered in ST 23 (0–20 cmbs [0–8 inbs]), is too fragmentary to determine its
intended function. Since none of these bifacial tools corresponds to formal types or styles, no
temporal or cultural period can be assigned. Lithic debitage (n=6) represents the only other
prehistoric artifact class recovered at this site. Though numerous examples were scattered over
the surface, only debitage recovered in shovel test excavations was collected for analysis and
curation. The majority of the debitage collected at 41RE125 represents biface thinning (n=4)
flakes, though rejuvenation (n=1) and core (n=1) flakes are present as well. This indicates that
several stages of stone tool manufacture and maintenance took place at this site.

Given its geomorphic position on the landscape and the apparent lack of burned rock or midden at
the site, 41RE125 could represent a hunting camp that was briefly, and perhaps repeatedly,
visited over time. The amount of disturbance to this site due to deflation processes makes a
prehistoric functional determination difficult, and no temporally sensitive artifacts were
recovered. The historic component, although quite limited, has material with manufacturing
dates spanning 1860–1930s, suggesting at least some historic-era activity at the turn of the
nineteenth/twentieth century. Since the site extends beyond the current project APE, the presence
of additional historic and prehistoric material in adjacent areas is likely. The extent of
archeological deposits at the site is confined to the surface, with very few exceptions. Since the
investigated site area within the ROW exhibits no discernable features or midden and the artifact
assemblage is not extensive enough to contribute additional knowledge of the prehistoric period
in the Frio River valley, the portion of site 41RE125 within the project area holds little potential
to contribute important information relevant to research questions. Thus, it is recommended that
the portion of 41RE125 within the project area is not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under the
criteria enumerated in 36 CFR 60.4 or for designation as an SAL under 13 TAC 26.8. However,
since the site likely extends beyond the project APE and has not been thoroughly investigated, the
site as a whole is considered to be of unknown eligibility. The site portion within the APE would
not affect the site recommendation if the entirety of site 41RE125 were later determined eligible.

Site 41RE126
Site 41RE126 (Figure 30) represents a prehistoric lithic scatter, possibly dating to the late Middle
Archaic (3000–2000 B.C.). The site is located along Spring Branch Drive in survey Section C
approximately 50 m (164 ft) south of the intersection of Spring Branch Drive and Bud Danner
Road. This area is on a portion of the terrace above the Frio River on the gravelly clay loam of
the Mailtrial-Meretta complex. The Frio River is located approximately 380 m (1,247 ft) west of
the site. The area immediately surrounding 41RE126 is covered by native vegetation; however,
much of the adjacent area has been at least partially cleared for residential development.
This site was initially identified during the intensive survey by the presence of a surface lithic
scatter encountered while visually inspecting the ROW during pedestrian survey. Upon the
discovery of the surface artifact scatter, a shovel test was excavated in the approximate center of
the scatter. No artifacts were recovered from below the surface, and the excavation was
terminated at 10 cmbs (4 inbs) due to bedrock. The surface artifact scatter extends approximately
5 m (16 ft) along the western margin of the ROW, and site limits within the project area were
defined by the extent of the surface artifact assemblage (Figure 31). It is possible that the site
extends beyond the transmission line ROW, but the scope of work and ROE issues did not permit
investigation of the adjacent areas.
Lithic debitage is the most common artifact present at the site, and numerous biface thinning
flakes were observed. Four lithics specimens, all of Edwards chert, were collected from the
surface of site 41RE126 (Table 10). Three biface thinning flakes were taken from the surface of
the site at the location of ST 51, but no additional debitage was collected from the area. Also
recovered from the surface of ST 51 was a fragmented, possibly stemmed, biface or dart point.
Although too fragmentary to be definitive, this biface could conform to the Travis-Nolan (cf. Bell
1960; Suhm et al. 1954) projectile point style interval of the late Middle Archaic Clear Fork
phase (Collins 1995; Prewitt 1981). Given the fragmentary nature of the biface, however, this
designation must be considered tentative. No artifacts were recovered from subsurface contexts
at the site.

Given the shallow soils in the area, there is little potential for buried deposits, and the site has
been impacted by the construction of Spring Branch Road and residential development in the
Twin Forks community. The portion of site 41RE126 within the project ROW lacks the
necessary integrity of association to contribute to research questions pertinent to the
understanding of prehistory.
This site could represent a hunting camp that was briefly, but perhaps repeatedly, visited over
time, based on its geomorphic position and the apparent lack of burned rock or midden deposits.
The amount of disturbance to this site, however, makes a functional determination difficult. The
extent of archeological deposits at the site is confined to the surface. The portion of site 41RE126
within the project ROW lacks the necessary integrity of association to contribute information to
research questions pertinent to the understanding of prehistory in the Frio River valley. Since the
investigated site area within the proposed ROW exhibits no discernable features or midden and
the artifact assemblage is not extensive enough to contribute additional information, it is
recommended that the portion of 41RE126 within the project area is not eligible for inclusion in
the NRHP under the criteria enumerated in 36 CFR 60.4 or for designation as an SAL under 13
TAC 26.8. However, since the site extends beyond the project APE and has not been thoroughly
investigated, the site as a whole is considered to be of unknown eligibility. The site portion
within the APE would not affect the site recommendation if the entirety of site 41RE126 were
later determined eligible.

Site 41RE127
Site 41RE127 (Figure 32) is a prehistoric lithic scatter located along Spring Branch Drive in
survey Section C, approximately 160 m (525 ft) south of the intersection of Spring Branch Drive
and Bud Danner Road. This area is on a portion of the terrace above the Frio River and is
situated on the gravelly clay loams of the Mailtrail-Meretta complex. The area immediately
surrounding site 41RE127 is covered by vegetation, primarily juniper, but much of the nearby
vegetation has been cleared for an access road and a utilities corridor. The Frio River is located
approximately 325 m (1,066 ft) southwest of the site.

This site was initially identified during intensive survey by the presence of a surface lithic scatter
encountered while visually inspecting the ROW during pedestrian survey. Upon the discovery of
the surface artifact scatter, a shovel test was excavated in the approximate center of the scatter.
No artifacts were recovered from below the surface, and the excavation was terminated at 20
cmbs (8 inbs) due to large quantities of gravel and cobbles. Lithic debitage is the only artifact
type present at the site, and numerous biface thinning flakes were observed. Two pieces of
Edwards chert debitage—one large core flake and one small manufacturing flake—were collected
from the surface of the site at the location of the shovel test excavation (ST 52), but no additional
debitage was collected from the area (Table 11). The surface artifact scatter extends from the
eastern margin of the proposed ROW to the east (Figure 33). Site limits were defined within the
ROW by the extent of the surface artifact assemblage, which were exposed in a two-track access
road to the west of Spring Branch Drive and a residential driveway to the east of Spring Branch
Drive. It is likely that the site extends beyond the transmission line ROW.

The presence of core and biface thinning flakes at the site may indicate that several stages of
stone tool manufacture and maintenance took place there. Given its geomorphic position and the
apparent lack of burned rock or midden at the site, 41RE127 could represent a hunting camp that
was briefly, and perhaps repeatedly, visited over time. The amount of disturbance to this site
makes a functional determination difficult, and no temporally sensitive artifacts were recovered.
The portion of site 41RE127 within the project ROW lacks the necessary integrity to contribute to
research questions pertinent to the understanding of prehistory. Since the investigated site area
within the proposed ROW exhibits no discernable features or midden and the artifact assemblage
is not extensive enough to contribute additional information, it is recommended that the portion
of 41RE127 within the project area is not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under the criteria
enumerated in 36 CFR 60.4 or for designation as an SAL under 13 TAC 26.8. However, since
the site extends beyond the project APE and has not been thoroughly investigated, the site as a
whole is considered to be of unknown eligibility. The site portion within the APE would not
affect the site recommendation if the entirety of site 41RE127 were later determined eligible.
Archeological Isolates
Eighteen isolated occurrences indicating past human activity were documented during this survey
(Table 12). An archeological isolate is not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP because of its
failure to meet site definition criteria and its insignificance in contributing information about the
archeological record. These items are not assigned a trinomial site number and are not submitted
to TARL for curation. Such isolated occurrences are simply documented by location and content,
as summarized here.

Isolate 1 (Section B) consists of a single piece of debitage recovered in ST 8 at a depth of 20–40
cm (8–16 in). Manufactured from Edwards chert, this artifact represents a biface thinning flake
and is likely the result of stone tool manufacture or maintenance at an indeterminate time in
prehistory. No additional artifacts were encountered in an adjacent shovel test excavation placed
5 m (16 ft) away or on the ground surface within 10 m (33 ft) of the shovel test.
Isolate 2 (Section B) consists of one piece of brown bottle glass and one piece of ferrous metal
recovered in ST 14 at a depth of 0–20 cm (0–8 in). These items could be of recent origin and no
additional artifacts were recovered in an adjacent shovel test excavation placed 5 m (16 ft) away
or on the ground surface within 10 m (33 ft) of the shovel test excavation. Therefore, both
artifacts are considered to be an isolated indication of human activity and do not meet the criteria
for site designation.
A prehistoric lithic core, Isolate 3 (Section C), was encountered along a utility corridor adjacent
to Spring Branch Drive. This artifact represents stone tool manufacture at an indeterminate time
in prehistory. It was found on the surface in a badly eroded area of thin soils near an ephemeral
drainage. No other artifacts were observed on the surface in the area, and soils were too thin and
discontinuous to warrant shovel test excavations. No additional artifacts were located in the
vicinity. The artifact was photographed in the field (Figure 34) and its location noted.
Figure

34.

Field photographs of Isolate 3 (10-cm [4-in] scale)

Figure 34. Field photographs of Isolate 3 (10-cm [4-in] scale).

Isolate 4 (Section C) consists of a single piece of lithic debitage. This artifact was collected from
ST 54 at a depth between 0 and 20 cm (0 and 8 in) in depth. Adjacent shovel tests placed at 5-m
(16-ft) intervals along the ROW revealed no additional artifacts. This artifact is likely the byproduct of stone tool maintenance at an indeterminate time in prehistory and may indicate that a
site exists outside the ROW to the northwest, extending across a relatively undisturbed tract
adjacent to the unnamed drainage, but this possibility was not investigated due to scope of work
and ROE limitations.
One basal fragment of a machine-made milk glass container, Isolate 5 (Section D), was located
along the fence line on the north side of John Davis Road, adjacent to the escarpment of the
Patterson Creek drainage. This container, dating to between 1910 and 1950, was likely used to
store a pharmaceutical or cosmetic, such as a salve or cream. A shovel test excavated in this area
revealed disturbed soil and no additional artifacts.
75

Isolate 6 (Section D) consists of four pieces of debitage, one with possible edge modification, all
of Edwards chert. These artifacts were located along John Davis Road at the location of a
livestock gate on the north side of the road. The soil in this area was deflated and compacted
from traffic passing through the gate. It is possible that these materials were transported to this
location as part of the gravel fill. Edge modifications on the flake could be the result of trampling
or vehicle traffic. Shovel tests excavated 5 m (16 ft) to the east and west of the gate in less
disturbed areas yielded no additional artifacts.
Two possible pieces of debitage and a possible fire-cracked rock, Isolate 7 (Section D), were
encountered near the west end of John Davis Road, near its junction with Highway 83. This area
coincides with a terrace escarpment above Patterson Creek along which numerous river cobbles
were observed across the ground surface. A shovel test was excavated in the area where these
materials were encountered, but no other artifacts were discovered.
Located on a terrace east of the Frio River, north of the intersection of David Rankin Road and
RM 1120, Isolates 8 and 9 (Section F) consist of one prehistoric lithic artifact each, recovered in
STs 74 and 76, excavated 5 m (16 ft) apart. Two adjacent shovel tests excavated in 5-m (16-ft)
intervals along the ROW produced no additional artifacts. These artifacts are Edwards chert
flakes from stone tool manufacture or maintenance. Although they may indicate the presence of a
site in the area beyond the ROW, they do not constitute a site.
Isolates 10–12 (Section C) consist of three pieces of Edwards chert debitage observed within a
73-m (240-ft) portion of roadway and the adjacent ditch along Camino Primero. Soils in this area
are typically thin, and road maintenance and residential development have disturbed the adjacent
areas.
Isolate 13 (Section C) was located on an exposed bedrock surface above an unnamed tributary of
the Frio River on the east side of Camino Alto. This isolate consists of a unifacial tool
manufactured from Edwards chert. No additional artifacts were observed within 20 m (66 ft),
despite nearly 100 percent surface visibility and the absence of soil deposition.
Isolate 14 (Section C) was located on an exposed bedrock surface above an unnamed tributary of
the Frio River on the west side of Camino Alto. This isolate consists of a crude biface or preform
manufactured from Edwards chert. No additional artifacts were observed within 20 m (66 ft),
despite nearly 100 percent surface visibility and the absence of soil deposition.
One concentration of crushed or burned caliche, Isolate 15 (Section D), was observed in the west
profile of Backhoe Trench 7 at a depth of 38–50 cm (1520 in) along Evergreen Street near
Leakey-Floral Cemetery. This concentration contained one wire nail, one piece of colorless
glass, one fragment of unidentifiable ferrous sheet metal, and one aqua glass bottle fragment. No
other artifacts were encountered within the trench. These artifacts are probably related to road
maintenance activities during the early twentieth century when Evergreen Street was the primary
route south of Leakey.
Isolate 16 (Section A), located along the southern edge of Stamford Hollow Road, consists of
four fragments of undecorated, pure white refined earthenware.
Isolate 17 (Section A) consists of more than 30 fragments of light green window glass scattered
adjacent to and immediately north of Stamford Hollow Road.
76

Isolate 18 (Section A), also along the southern edge of Stamford Hollow Road, consists of a
single fragment of thick, undecorated, pure white refined earthenware basal fragment with a
partial “…SEBRING…” marker’s mark in blue transfer print (Figure 35). This mark indicates
that the ceramic was likely produced in Sebring, Ohio, where approximately 60 potteries have
existed since the town was founded in 1898 (Sebring Ohio Historical Society 2011a), although
some of these appear to have been based in other nearby towns such as Alliance and Salem
(Sebring Ohio Historical Society 2011b). Both Lehner (1988) and the Sebring Ohio Historical
Society illustrate several maker’s marks that are consistent with this artifact (Table 13); however,
examples of maker’s marks were not available for all of the potential manufacturers. The partial
maker’s mark most closely resembles the Limoges “Jiffy Ware” maker’s mark (1935–1941
[Gates and Ormerod 1982:174]).

None of the isolated artifacts documented during this survey is believed to have the potential to
contribute significant information regarding the history of the area. In the absence of additional
artifacts in more well-preserved contexts, none of these isolated occurrences of past human
behavior meet the criteria for archeological site designation and are therefore not eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as an SAL, as per 36 CFR 60.4, 13 TAC 26.5(6), 13
TAC 26.5(32), and 13 TAC 26.8. It is therefore recommended that no further work is necessary
at these locations.

CHAPTER 6
SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The goal of this cultural resources survey was to document and assess cultural resources for the
city of Leakey’s proposed wastewater treatment facility site and associated wastewater
transmission lines ROW and to provide adequate and relevant information for use in the
management of these cultural resources within the project area. This investigation included a
review of background literature, archeological and historical site records, and previous
archeological surveys conducted in the area prior to fieldwork. Fieldwork investigations
consisted of a combination of reconnaissance and intensive archeological survey techniques. The
APE for this project consisted of approximately 194 acres (78.5 hectares) for the treatment
facility site and the final proposed 18 mi (29 km) of transmission lines ROW measuring 35.0 ft
(10.7 m) in width. This length excludes previously surveyed portions of the original project area
that are no longer within the proposed transmission corridors, although these areas are discussed
in this report where appropriate. The entire project area was inspected via reconnaissance survey
methods and an intensive pedestrian survey resulted in the excavation of 269 shovel tests in areas
where undisturbed soils or surface artifacts were encountered. As a result of these efforts, four
new sites (41RE124, 41RE125, 41RE126, and 41RE127) were discovered, two previously
recorded sites (41RE48 and 41RE106) were revisited, the potential for deeply buried cultural
deposits in proximity to the Frio River was investigated, and archeological scraping and trenching
in the vicinity of the historic Leakey-Floral Cemetery was conducted to detect the presence of
unmarked graves.
The portions of sites 41RE48, 41RE106, 41RE124, 41RE125, 41RE126, and 41RE127 within the
current proposed APE represent relatively minimal cultural remains in contexts that appear to
have been severely altered and disturbed by subsequent use. The investigated areas of the sites
fail to meet the criteria set forth in 36 CFR § 60.4. With regard to the NRHP eligibility of these
sites, none of the investigated portions of the sites is associated with events or the lives of persons
important in history (Criteria a and b), they do not represent distinctive characteristics of a type,
period, or method of construction (Criterion c), nor do they retain information important in
prehistory or history (Criterion d) (National Park Service 1990:2). The portions of these sites
within the APE lack the necessary integrity of association and materials and potential to yield
information relevant to the criteria set forth in 36 CFR § 60.4. Therefore, it is recommended that
the portions of the sites within the APE are not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. Likewise, the
portions of these sites within the APE are not significant historic properties as defined under 13
79

TAC 26.5(6), 13 TAC 26.5(32), and 13 TAC 26.8 and are therefore not eligible for designation as
SALs. These site areas have been documented and recorded with TARL. However, each of these
documented sites extends beyond the current APE, and those portions of the sites are
uninvestigated and of unknown extent and significance. Therefore, these recommendations
pertain only to the site areas that fall within the current APE.
Backhoe trenching and archeological scraping in portions of the project area adjacent to the
historic Leakey-Floral Cemetery indicate that no unmarked historic period graves are likely to be
present along the western side of Evergreen Street. This area currently supports several
aboveground and buried utilities. Installation of the proposed transmission lines is not likely to
encounter unmarked graves.
No deeply buried cultural deposits were encountered in backhoe trenches excavated within the
floodplain and low terraces of the Frio River. However, considering the archeological potential
of the area in general, backhoe trenching at specific lift station locations, once these locations are
determined more precisely, is recommended due to their depth of impact and the potential for
deeply buried cultural deposits in this area.
In summary, no significant historic properties as defined under 36 CFR 60.4, 13 TAC 26.5(6), 13
TAC 26.5(32), and 13 TAC 26.8 were identified during these investigations within portions of the
proposed project area accessible to this cultural resources survey. It is also recommended that
deep testing via backhoe trenching be conducted at the previously unsurveyed locations of the
proposed lift stations (see Figure 1) once these locations are more precisely determined and ROEs
have been arranged with the appropriate landowners.

Four fragments that

two marks embossed on base
but orientation isn't clear,
either an "8" with an
embossed line below or an
infinity symbol with a "1" or

8/infinity symbol is open;
many of the aqua glass

probably belong to the base,

49-x-20 mm in size; has
Owen's ring; embossed "6
['O' in square maker's mark]
4"; maker's mark used Owens
Bottle Co.; "sick" glass

Two pieces that refit; has
Owen's ring; partial; exterior
of bottle is facetted; base is
embossed with "H" over "A"
Hazel-Atlas maker's mark
(Toulouse 1971:239) with the
number "2" above it;
estimated size 62-x-47 mm;
"sick" glass

partial; embossed with a large
"A" with the number "17"
nestled in the base; the form
of the "A" is similar to the
letter used in the Hazel-Atlas
maker's mark

Only part of base; embossed
with a "v", underscore line,
and "D" all in one vertical
row and a partial Hazel-Atlas
maker's mark to the right
(Toulouse 1971:239); a
Hazel-Atlas brochure (n.d.)
suggests that the "v" probably
indicates that it was produced
in their Plainfield, IL plant;
Toulouse (1971:240)
indicates that this plant was
built in 1957
