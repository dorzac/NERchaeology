Intensive Cultural Resources Survey
of the Proposed Alternate Pilot Knob Wastewater Interceptor Phase 2B Project

ABSTRACT
At the request of Brookfield Residential, SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) conducted an
intensive cultural resources survey for the Alternate Pilot Knob Wastewater Interceptor Phase 2B Project
along Cottonmouth Creek in southeast Austin, Travis County, Texas. The project area is located on lands
that ultimately will be owned by a municipal utility district (MUD), a political subdivision of the State of
Texas. As such, the proposed undertaking is subject to review under the Antiquities Code of Texas
(ACT). Archaeological field investigations required a Texas Antiquities Permit (TAP) be issued by the
Texas Historical Commission. SWCA conducted investigations under TAP No. 7895 issued to Principal
Investigator, Brandon S. Young.
The project involves the construction of an approximately 3,077-foot-long wastewater interceptor within
an 80-foot-wide easement, as well as immediately adjacent work areas that encompass a total of
approximately 10.7 acres. The study area is along, and bisected north to south by, Cottonmouth School
Road off of Dee Gabriel Collins Road, approximately 0.75 mile northwest of U.S. Highway 183. The
depth of impacts is anticipated to extend up to 10 feet below ground surface. This represents the area of
potential effects (APE) for this project.
Investigations included a background literature review and an intensive pedestrian survey with shovel
testing of the project area. The background literature review determined that eight cultural resources
surveys have been conducted near the proposed project area; those various investigations, as well as
others, resulted in the recording of 13 archaeological sites within a 1-mile radius of the APE. In addition,
two cemeteries are located within a 1-mile radius of the project area, one of which is situated along the
northwest margin of the project area. The review of the Texas Department of Transportation Historic
Overlay maps revealed two possible historic-age structures and one cemetery within, or immediately
adjacent to, the APE.
The intensive pedestrian survey revealed primarily agricultural lands and riparian zones on the gently
sloping floodplain and the rolling gravelly ridges of Cottonwood Creek within the upland Blackland
Prairie environment. Previous impacts to the project area include erosion, vegetation clearing and grading,
agricultural and residential activity, two-track roads, fence lines, push piles, utility installations (overhead
and subsurface), residential construction, and impervious cover, such as asphalt and paved areas. During
the intensive survey investigations, which comprised visual inspection and the excavation of 22 shovel
tests, SWCA identified no surface or subsurface cultural materials, with the exception of one historic
isolated find along the northern margin of the project area, and the Collins Cemetery immediately
adjacent to the northwest margin of the APE.
In accordance with 33 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 800.4, SWCA has made a reasonable and good
faith effort to identify cultural resources properties within the APE. No properties were identified within
the APE that may meet the criteria for listing in the National Register of Historic Places according to 36
CFR 60.4, or for designation as a State Antiquities Landmark, according to 13 Texas Administrative
Code 26.10. Therefore, SWCA recommends that no additional cultural resource investigations should be
warranted within the project area, as currently defined. However, due to the close proximity of the Collins
Cemetery, SWCA recommends avoidance and no encroachment along the northwestern margin of the
APE just west Cottonmouth School Road. The cemetery is protected under 711.035(f) and 711.010(a)(b)
of the Health and Safety Code of Texas and avoidance is required by state law.

INTRODUCTION
At the request of Brookfield Residential, SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) conducted an
intensive cultural resources survey for the Alternate Pilot Knob Wastewater Interceptor Phase 2B Project
along Cottonmouth Creek in southeast Austin, Travis County, Texas (Figure 1). The project involves the
construction of an approximately 3,077-foot-long wastewater interceptor within an 80-foot-wide
easement, as well as immediately adjacent work areas. The total size of the proposed area of investigation
and interceptor alignment is 10.7 acres in extent, which represents the direct area of potential effects
(APE) for this project. The project area is on lands that ultimately will be owned by a municipal utility
district (MUD), a political subdivision of the State of Texas; therefore, the project is subject to review
under the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) and archaeological field investigations required a Texas
Antiquities Permit (TAP) issued by the Texas Historical Commission (THC).
In 2014, SWCA performed a cultural resources survey of the Pilot Knob 1.7-mile-long wastewater
interceptor line project area under SWCA project number 30376 in compliance with U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE) permitting obligations (Young and Nielsen 2015). Subsequent to SWCAâs survey,
the project area was expanded to the north 0.34 mile north-northeast of Dee Gabriel Collins Road. In
2015, SWCA returned to the area and surveyed the additional 1,795.21-foot-long Phase 2 extension under
SWCA project number 33011 in compliance with the ACT (Young et al. 2015). The investigations
verified the location of the historic-age Collins Cemetery, revisited site 41TV2366, a historic-age earlytwentieth-century farmstead, and identified newly recorded site 41TV2480, a historic-age circa 1955
residence with no associated artifacts. It was determined that the APE was located 93 feet north of the
cemetery and adequately avoided the resource (Young and Nielsen 2015; Young et al. 2015). The two
sites were recommended as not eligible for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or for
designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) (Young and Nielsen 2015; Young et al. 2015). As
such, no further work was recommended as a result of the investigations.
The purpose of this investigation was to identify and assess any cultural resources, such as historic and
prehistoric archaeological sites and historic buildings, structures, objects, and sites (such as cemeteries)
that might be located within the boundaries of the proposed undertaking, and evaluate the significance
and eligibility of these cultural resources for designation as an SAL. Investigations consisted of an
intensive pedestrian survey with shovel testing of the proposed project area. All investigations were
conducted in accordance with the ACT and standards and guidelines established by the THC and Council
of Texas Archeologists (CTA).

PROJECT PERSONNEL
Brandon Young, M.A., RPA, served as Principal Investigator and Task Lead for the duration of the
project, overseeing overall logistics and organization, managing reporting, and agency consultation. The
survey was completed by archaeologists Mercedes C. Cody and Tatianna Martinez on January 25, 2017,
under TAP No. 7895. Mercedes C. Cody prepared the report of investigations, while Carole Carpenter
expertly produced all field and report maps for the project. Lauri Logan provided technical editing and
document preparation.

PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION
The project area appears on portions of the Montopolis, Texas (3097-213) U.S. Geological Survey
(USGS) 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle map (see Figure 1). The project area is located along and
bisected north to south by Cottonmouth School Road off of Dee Gabriel Collins Road, approximately
0.75 mile northwest of U.S. Highway 183 (US 183) in a semi-rural setting surrounded by rolling, open
pastures and scattered and expanding residential and commercial development (Figure 2). Overall, the
project involves the construction of an approximately 3,077-foot-long wastewater interceptor within an
80-foot-wide easement, as well as immediately adjacent work areas. The total size of the proposed survey
area and interceptor alignment is 10.7 acres. The depth of impacts is anticipated to extend up to 10 feet
below ground surface.
The APE is intersected by Cottonmouth Creek, a northward-flowing drainage that empties into Onion
Creek, roughly 1.5 miles downstream from the project area. The vegetation within the APE consists of
various hardwoods particularly along the riparian zone of Cottonmouth Creek and agricultural fields
along the uplands encompassing the creek. Previous impacts to the project area include erosion,
vegetation clearing and grading, agricultural and residential activity, two-track roads, fence lines, push
piles, utility installations (overhead and subsurface), residential construction, and impervious cover, such
as asphalt and paved areas. No impacts to the channel of Cottonmouth Creek are proposed as the planned
interceptor will be bored beneath the creek.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
GEOLOGY AND SOILS
The underlying geology throughout the project area consists of Late Cretaceous igneous rocks, which are
pyroclastics often intruded with basalt (Barnes 1974). Project area soils are mapped, in order of
prevalence, as Tinn clay, 0 to 1 percent slopes, frequently flooded; Behring clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes;
and Behring clay, 3 to 5 percent slopes (Natural Resources Conservation Service [NRCS] 2017).
Frequently flooded Tinn soils are found on clay bottomlands and formed in clayey alluvium along
floodplains of streams draining the Blackland Prairie. They are characterized as very deep, well-drained,
permeable soils and correspond with Cottonmouth Creek within the project area. Behring soils are upland
soils that developed in place from clayey residuum weathered from shale situated along nearly level to
sloping erosional uplands, such as the backslope of ridges. They are characterized as deep permeable soils
and are found in the open pasture areas east and west of Cottonmouth Creek. Although Tinn clay
developed from clayey alluvium, the project area exhibits minimal to no terrace development along
Cottonmouth Creek. As such, there is limited potential to contain buried archaeological materials,
although deeply buried cultural deposits are unlikely, given the erosional environment.

VEGETATION
The APE is situated along the margin of the Edwards Plateau and the Blackland Prairie regions (Everitt et
al. 2002; Kutac and Caran 1994). The Edwards Plateau forms a sharp boundary in floral distribution
between the thin-soiled limestone uplands and the wide coastal plains. Upland areas are dominated by a
mixed live oak (Quercus virginiana) and Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei) woodland interspersed with
occasional grassy openings. Other tree species present in low densities throughout these areas include
cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia) and Texas oak (Quercus fusiformis). Shrub density varies between low to
dense in upland areas. Species occurring in low densities include Texas persimmon (Diospyros texana),
agarita (Berberis trifoliolata), and prickly pear (Opuntia spp.) with thick, mixed grasses in areas (Van
Auken 1988). Originally, the uplands of the Edwards Plateau sustained short grasses and the alluvial
valleys had deciduous forests (Black 1989:12). The lower elevation areas along the riparian zone often
include a dense understory of acacia (Acacia spp.), prickly pear, and other brushy species (Petrides 1988;
Simpson 1988).
FAUNA
Two biotic provinces divide Travis County (Blair 1950). The western portions of Travis County lie within
the Balconian biotic province that comprises the Edwards Plateau region (Blair 1950). The eastern
portions of the county are within the Texan biotic province, which extends from central Texas to eastcentral Oklahoma (Blair 1950). The APE is situated within the eastern half of Travis County at the
western edge of the Texan biotic province.
The Balconian and Texan biotic provinces are transitional zones from the mesic forests of eastern North
America to the xeric grasslands of the central United States. These provinces have a high faunal diversity.
Blair (1950) identified at least 49 species of mammals, 57 species of reptiles, and 23 species of
amphibians native to the Texan biotic province. The Balconian contains 57 species of mammal, over 42
species of reptile, and 15 species of amphibians (Blair 1950). None of the fauna for the Balconian is
restricted solely to this province (Blair 1950).
Some native mammals common to the Texan biotic province include: opossum (Didelphis virginiana),
eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus), eastern fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), pocket gopher (Geomys
breviceps), fulvous harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys fulvescens), white-footed mouse (Peromyscus
leucopus), hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), eastern cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus), swamp
rabbit (Sylvilagus aquaticus) (Burt and Grossenheider 1976).
Mammals common to both of these provinces include coyote (Canis latrans), gray fox (Urocyon
cinereoargenteus), mink (Mustela vison), muskrat (Ondatra zibethica), raccoon (Procyon lotor), striped
skunk (Mephitis mephitis), and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Historically, red wolf, bison
and black bear ranged into or near these regions (Burt and Grossenheider 1976; Davis and Schmidly
1994; Schmidly 1983).
The general reptilian assemblage for both provinces include the Great Plains rat snake (Elaphe guttata
emoryi), eastern yellowbelly racer (Coluber constrictor flaviventris), yellow mud turtle (Kinosternon
flavescens flavescens), bullfrog (Rana catesbiana), southern leopard frog (Rana utricularia), and the Gulf
Coast toad (Bufo valliceps) (Blair 1950; Conant and Collins 1998; Kutac and Caran 1994; Werler and
Dixon 2004).

CULTURAL SETTING
Situated in southern Travis County, the APE lies within the Central Texas archaeological region, as
defined by Collins (1995) and Prewitt (1981). This area is noted by its distinctive environmental
conditions, as it is located at the boundary of the moist, humid forests to the east and drier, savannah-like
grasslands to the west that greatly influenced cultural development. The following cultural-historic
outline is based on the regional chronologies proposed by Collins (1995) and Johnson and Goode (1994),
which build upon the seminal efforts of Suhm (1960) and Prewitt (1981, 1985). Using standard
terminology, the cultural sequence is divided into four periods: Paleoindian, Archaic, Late Prehistoric,
and Historic. The Archaic period is subdivided into four subperiods: Early, Middle, Late, and
Transitional.
PALEOINDIAN PERIOD
Paleoindian artifacts and sites date from about 11,500 to 8800 years before present (B.P.) and are not
uncommon in Central Texas (Collins 1995, 2004), but are fairly rare in the APE (Bever and Meltzer
2007). The period begins at the close of the Pleistocene with the earliest evidence of humans in the
Central Texas region. Diagnostic artifacts of the period include lanceolate-shaped, fluted projectile points
such as Clovis, Folsom, and Plainview types. These projectile points were hafted onto wooden spears,
launched from atlatls (spear throwers), and used to hunt a variety of game, including mammoth,
mastodons, bison, camel, and horse (Black 1989). During the Paleoindian period, the prominent
interpretation suggests a hunter-gatherer adaptation strategy with increased harvesting of flora and small
game as the big game died off and the climate warmed following the end of the Pleistocene ice age.
Representative Central Texas Paleoindian sites include Kincaid Rockshelter, Wilson-Leonard, Gault, and
St. Maryâs Hall (Collins 1995).
ARCHAIC PERIOD
As the Paleoindian period came to an end, humans began to harvest more intensively local floral and
faunal resources (Collins 1995, 2004). Material culture became more diverse and the use of burned rock
middens and ovens became widespread. This period is known as the Archaic period and dates from
approximately 8800 to 1200 B.P. in Central Texas (Collins 1995; Johnson and Goode 1994). While
Collins (1995) and Johnson and Goode (1994) subdivide the Archaic into Early, Middle, and Late
subperiods, we have added the Transitional subperiod after the Late Archaic for reasons discussed below.
EARLY ARCHAIC
Early Archaic artifacts and sites date from about 8800 to 6000 B.P. (Collins 1995). Once thought to be
Paleoindian in age, some unstemmed point types, such as Angostura, have recently been recognized as the
first Early Archaic diagnostic styles (Collins 1995). By about 8000 B.P., these points were replaced by
stemmed varieties such as Early Split Stem, Martindale, and Uvalde (Black 1989; Collins 1995). Most
sites were open campsites although cave sites have been found (Collins 1995). Current site distribution
data suggest that Early Archaic peoples were concentrated along the eastern and southern margins of the
Edwards Plateau in areas with more stable water sources (Collins 1995; McKinney 1981). Specialized
tools, perhaps used in woodworking, known as Guadalupe and Nueces bifaces, were prevalent in this
period (Collins 1995). While subsistence data are sparse, it appears that people hunted deer and other
small animals, fished, and cooked bulbs in earth ovens (Collins 1995). This strategy evolved, in part, due
to the changing climate at the beginning of the Holocene (McKinney 1981).

MIDDLE ARCHAIC
Middle Archaic artifacts and sites date from about 6000 to 4000 B.P. with multi-use bifacial knives
becoming more common. Characteristic Middle Archaic projectile points include Bell, Andice, Taylor,
Nolan, and Travis, several of which are deeply notched (Black 1989). These artifacts could have served as
knives and projectile points. Bison were hunted intensively at the start of the Middle Archaic but, as the
climate became drier, a reliance on dry climate plants such as sotol probably became common. The end of
the Middle Archaic may have been the most xeric conditions ever in Central Texas (Collins 1995). The
climatic change was accompanied by a technological shift as Nolan and Travis points, which are thick
and have narrow blades, first appeared in the archaeological record (Collins 1995). Burned rock middens
and earth ovens first appeared ca. 5000 B.P. and became increasingly common, although their exact
functions may have varied based on the culture and environment (Johnson and Goode 1994).
Representative sites of the Texas Middle Archaic include the Landslide, Wounded Eye, Gibson, and
Panther Springs (Collins 1995).
LATE ARCHAIC
Late Archaic artifacts and sites date from about 4000 to 2250 B.P. The period began with very xeric
conditions but gradually became more mesic (Collins 1995). Characteristic dart point types include
Bulverde, Pedernales, Marshall, and Marcos (Collins 1995). Increasingly complex and sedentary cultural
manifestations first appeared in the Late Archaic. Sites of the Late Archaic are very common and include
burned rock middens, open campsites, and lithic procurement sites. Population increases are evidenced by
large cemeteries and grave goods. Also, trade and exchange networks between cultures appear to have
increased in complexity as evidenced by exotic goods in sites and cemeteries (Black 1989). Bement
(1991) interprets the evidence for group investment in territory due to evidence in the Thunder Valley
sinkhole cemetery, dated to 2900 B.P. based on stratigraphy, to indicate that groups were declaring control
over a particular territorial range during the Late Archaic. Representative sites of the Central Texas Late
Archaic include the Anthon and Loeve Fox sites (Collins 1995).
TRANSITIONAL ARCHAIC
As Collins (1995:384â385) notes, diverse and comparatively complex archaeological manifestations
toward the end of the Late Archaic attest to the emergence of kinds of human conduct without precedent
in the area. This period (2250â1250 B.P.), referred to as the Transitional Archaic (Turner and Hester
1999) or Terminal Archaic (Black 1989), is not recognized by all researchers. Other chronologies extend
the Late Archaic to 1200â1250 B.P. (Collins 1995; Johnson and Goode 1994) to encompass this later
subperiod. Johnson et al. (1962) originally designated the Transitional Archaic as a subperiod of the
Archaic because of the similarities between the latest dart point types and the earliest arrow point types.
Since then, however, the designation has failed to be universally accepted by researchers. In two
chronologies for Central Texas, Collins (1995) does not include the Transitional as a subperiod of the
Archaic, and Johnson and Goode (1994) separate the Late Archaic into two subperiods designated Late
Archaic I and Late Archaic II. The Transitional Archaic, as it is used here, closely corresponds to Johnson
and Goodeâs (1994) Late Archaic II, but begins after the appearance of the Marcos point typeânot with
it. In this scheme, the Transitional Archaic coincides with the last two style intervals recognized by
Collins (1995:Table 2) for the Late Archaic subperiod.
During the Transitional Archaic, smaller dart point forms such as Darl, Ensor, Fairland, and Frio were
developed (Turner and Hester 1999). These points were probably ancestral to the first Late Prehistoric
arrow point types and may have overlapped temporally with them (Hester 1995; Houk and Lohse 1993).

Several researchers believe that the increased interaction between groups at the end of the Late Archaic
was an important catalyst for cultural change (Collins 1995; Johnson and Goode 1994). This change may
have included increased regional stress and conflict between groups as interaction became more frequent
(Houk et al. 1997). In Bexar County, for instance, researchers noted a distinct shift in settlement patterns
during this period (Houk et al. 1997). Groups apparently used hilltops as camps rather than just lithic
procurement locations. These elevated locations would have provided points from which to observe game
and other groups of humans as they moved through the surrounding creek valleys and upland prairies
(Houk et al. 1997).
LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD
By the end of the Transitional Archaic, the bow and arrow was introduced, as indicated by the
increasingly smaller size of projectile points. The Late Prehistoric period dates from 1250 to 260 B.P.
(Collins 1995). Characteristic artifacts include small arrow points such as Perdiz and Scallorn, as well as a
variety of specific-use tools. The Austin and Toyah intervals of the Late Prehistoric, originally recognized
by Suhm (1960) and Jelks (1962) remain accepted divisions for the period. These style intervals may
represent distinct cultural entities (Johnson 1994), although others challenge this view (Black and Creel
1997).
During the earlier Austin interval, use of burned rock middens may have reached its maximum, based on
conclusions by Black and Creel (1997). Characteristic arrow points of the Austin interval include Scallorn
and Edwards (Collins 1995; Turner and Hester 1999). By the Toyah interval, plain-ware ceramics
appeared, indicating possible influence in the Central Texas region from ceramic-producing cultures to
the east and north (Perttula et al. 1995). Contrary to bog pollen data (Collins et al. 1993), data from Hallâs
Cave in Kerr County indicate that the climate of Central Texas began to dry around 1000 B.P. (Toomey et
al. 1993). This drying trend may have resulted in a change in vegetation that made Central and South
Texas more conducive to bison migration into the area. Bison remains in archaeological sites in the region
became common after 750 B.P. (Dillehay 1974; Huebner 1991).
Most Toyah sites have the distinctive Perdiz arrow point type, and some sites also have bison processing
tool kits. This technological change has been interpreted by Johnson (1994) as a spread of an ethnic group
and by Ricklis (1992) as the spread of technological ideas in response to opportunities provided by
increased bison populations in the Late Prehistoric. It is thought that during the Late Prehistoric period,
subsistence strategies became increasing complex and that human populations were very high (Black
1989; Collins 1995). Representative sites of the Central Texas Late Prehistoric include the Kyle, Smith,
and Currie Sites (Collins 1995).

SPANISH COLONIAL/MEXICAN INDEPENDENCE PERIOD (1630â1820S)
In the early Historic period (A.D. 1630 to present), the period of European contact and settlement in
Texas, the general Austin area was inhabited by several aboriginal groups including the Jumano,
Tonkawa, Lipan Apache and Comanche (Newcomb 2002). The first Europeans into the area were
probably Spanish missionaries who established three missions at nearby Barton Springs in 1730 (Webb
1952). The Spanish mission period in this area was of short duration and failed to colonize or even tame
the area south of the Colorado River and north of Onion Creek. An aboriginal presence thus continued in
the Austin area into the 1860s.
After Mexico gained independence from Spain, the newly formed country used a policy of land grants to
attract Anglos from the United States to help inhabit the sparsely populated northern regions of Mexico.
During the 1820s, Stephen F. Austin obtained grants from the Mexican government to settle hundreds of
families along the lower Brazos and Colorado Rivers (Webb 1952). This colony, known as the âOld

Three Hundred Colony,â was successful in pushing the European settlement frontier further west into the
Central Texas region. Prior to the Texas Revolution, most of the âOld Three Hundred Colonyâ settlement
was focused south of Bastrop and the old La Bahia Road (Webb 1952).

REPUBLIC OF TEXAS/PRE-CIVIL WAR (1836â1860)
During the Texas Revolution with Mexico, the area continued to be inhabited only by aboriginal Native
Americans. After the war, a growing Texan population led many settlers to move northwards in search of
open, profitable land to plant crops and raise cattle. This wave of migration spurned new conflicts with
the native groups living in the area, cumulating in the Battle of Brushy Creek, near what is today the town
of Taylor, in February of 1839. This battle, between the Comanche and the Texas Raiders, resulted in
numerous deaths and eventually resulted in the removal of the Native American presence in the area.

THE POSTâCIVIL WAR TO TWENTIETH CENTURY (1865â1950)
Subsequent to the Civil War, Texas entered the Reconstruction period. To begin reconstruction federal
troops, in part, had to spread the word of the Emancipation Proclamation (Campbell 2003:268). In
Galveston on June 19, 1865, General Gordon Granger and the Union army spread the word of the slavesâ
emancipation (Campbell 2003:268). Thus, this day became known as âJuneteenthâ and has been
celebrated by Texas African Americans ever since (Campbell 2003:268).
Recovery during this period was gradual, but was assisted by a diverse agricultural economy particularly
cattle. In the 1870s, several major cattle trails heading to markets passed through Central Texas. One
invention that had an effect on Texas and its economy during this time was barbed wire. Barbed wire, first
demonstrated in 1871, enabled ranchers to alter land and control cattle in a less-intrusive, more profitable
manner, and brought additional commerce and trade to central and South Texas (NRHP 1976). Though
barbed wire was one of the largest influences on Texas in general, the most influential âinventionâ on the
region was the railroad. The railroads effectively served as a means of transportation and, to varying
degrees, generally bolstered growth in the economies of the region.
Lawlessness became a problem during the 1880s, and Travis and Central Texas counties experienced a
period of âmob rule.â Citizens formed an anti-mob organization, but competing groups conducted
essentially open warfare. After several people were killed, the Texas Rangers were dispatched to the area
and order was eventually restored (Murphy 2007).
Throughout the early twentieth century, trade, transportation, and tourism continued to bring economic
prosperity to the region. The establishment of military facilities and the activity surrounding World War I
and World War II kept the railway system active and commercial activity in the east prospered. Through
the remainder of the twentieth century, population in Central Texas increased largely due to expansion
and commercial opportunities in urban and rural areas. The construction of public highways and
automobiles facilitated the commuting of Central Texas citizens to urban employment.

BACKGROUND REVIEW AND HISTORIC MAP REVIEW
SWCA conducted a thorough background literature review of the project area. An SWCA archaeologist
reviewed the Montopolis, Texas (3097-213) USGS 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle map and records
pertaining to the project area on the THC online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (THC 2017) database.
These sources provided information on the nature and location of previously conducted cultural resources
surveys, previously recorded historic and/or prehistoric archaeological sites, NRHP districts and
properties, SALs, Official Texas Historical Markers, Registered Texas Historic Landmarks, cemeteries,
and local neighborhood surveys within or near the project area. Additionally, SWCA examined the Texas

Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Texas Historic Overlay Maps, a mapping/geographic information
system (GIS) database with historic maps and resource information covering most portions of the state
(Foster et al. 2006).
The background literature review determined that eight cultural resources surveys are known to have been
conducted near the proposed project area; those various investigations, as well as others, resulted in the
recording of 13 archaeological sites within a 1-mile radius of the APE (Table 1). In addition, two
cemeteries are located within a 1-mile radius of the project area, of which one is situated along the
northwest margin of the APE. The review of the TxDOT Historic Overlay maps also revealed two
possible historic-age structures and one cemetery within or immediately adjacent to the APE (Foster et al.
2006).

In January 2010, Ecological Communications Corporation (ECOMM) conducted an archaeological
survey on behalf of the City of Austin for the expansion of water lines for the South Interstate Highway
35 Water/Wastewater Program Project, located approximately 0.60 mile south of the current project area
(Butler and Feit 2010). The survey resulted in the discovery of one archaeological site (41TV2366) within
the project area, an early-twentieth-century historic farmstead recommended as not eligible for the NRHP
or as an SAL (Butler and Feit 2010). Additionally, Butler and Feit (2010) revisited another previously
recorded cultural resource site (41TV1096), and the investigations determined the entire site had been
destroyed. Both of these sites are located within a 1-mile radius of the current project area (see Table 1).
In October 2013, Jacobs Engineering, Inc. performed an archaeological survey for the Pilot Knob MUD
No. 1 at the site of the proposed Phase 1A Pilot Knob 30-inch Wastewater Interceptor, approximately
0.17 mile east of the current project area (Voellinger 2013). The investigations revisited previously
recorded sites 41TV404 and 41TV405 that were originally recorded in 1978 by Hayden Whitsett with the
Texas Water Development Board and are situated within a 1-mile radius of the current project area (see
Table 1). Both sites are prehistoric lithic procurement sites and the latter also contains a âpre-1873, maybe
pre-1860â component according to a local informant (Voellinger 2013). The prehistoric components for
both sites were recommended as not eligible for designation as SALs or for the NRHP. However, the
historic component for site 41TV405 was not fully evaluated, due to its location outside of the APE and

therefore remains undetermined for SAL and NRHP eligibility with further investigations recommended
(Voellinger 2013).
In March 2014, SWCA conducted cultural resources investigation on behalf of Brookfield Residential and
Travis County for the proposed Easton Park Development Project in southeast Austin, Texas, located
approximately 0.80 mile south of the current project area (Stotts et al. 2014). The project involved the
construction of a roughly 2.0-mile-long extension of William Cannon Drive between McKinney Falls
Parkway and US 183. The investigations revisited sites 41TV2196 and 41TV2366 and documented two
new archaeological sites (41TV2458 and 41TV2459), of which 41TV2366 is located within a 1-mile
radius of the current APE (see Table 1). The cultural resources that were encountered are primarily
associated with structures that are components of historic homesteads and farmsteads and activities from
the early to mid-twentieth century. Based on a variety of factors, none of the archaeological sites recorded
or revisited during this survey were recommended for the NRHP or as an SAL (Stotts et al. 2014).
In 2014, SWCA performed a cultural resources survey of the Pilot Knob 1.7-mile-long wastewater
interceptor line project area under SWCA project number 30376 in compliance with USACE permitting
obligations (Young and Nielsen 2015). Subsequent to SWCAâs survey, the project area was expanded to
the north 0.34 mile north-northeast of Dee Gabriel Collins Road. In 2015, SWCA returned to the area and
surveyed the additional 1,795.21-foot-long Phase 2 extension under SWCA project number 33011 in
compliance with the ACT (Young et al. 2015). The investigations verified the location of the historic-age
Collins Cemetery, revisited site 41TV2366 a historic-age early-twentieth-century farmstead, and
identified newly recorded site 41TV2480, a historic-age circa 1955 residence with no associated artifacts.
It was determined that the APE was located 93 feet north of the cemetery and adequately avoided this
resource (Young and Nielsen 2015; Young et al. 2015). The two sites were recommended as not eligible
for the NRHP or as an SAL (Young and Nielsen 2015; Young et al. 2015). As such, no further work was
recommended as a result of the investigations.
The Collins Cemetery (also known as the Alexander or Alexander-Collins Cemetery) is located along the
northwest margin of the current APE on the west side of Cottonmouth School Road, approximately
0.15 mile northwest of its intersection of Dee Gabriel Collins Road, within a wooded lot between two
gravel driveways with modern residences located to the north and south. The cemetery was listed as a
Historic Texas Cemetery in 2004 (TV-C188) and is purported to contain African American graves (THC
2017). The Collins Cemetery is approximately 1 acre in size and contains late-nineteenth- to earlytwentieth-century graves loosely grouped in two separate areas and composed of six headstones and two
metal placards lacking legible inscriptions (Young and Nielsen 2015; Young et al. 2015). Individuals
interred at the cemetery include those from the Collins and Bremond families including Newton Isaac
(N.I.) Collins, Sr., a freed slave who moved to Texas from Alabama in 1863 (FindAGrave.com 2017a and
2017b). The cemetery is protected under 711.035(f) and 711.010(a)(b) of the Health and Safety Code of
Texas. As a result, avoidance of the cemetery is required by state law.
Another cemetery located within a 1-mile radius of the northeast of the current project area is situated at
the corner of Colton Road and Hillmore Drive on the frontage of US 183. The Charles F. Austin
Cemetery was listed as a Historic Texas Cemetery in 2000 (TV-C007) and is reported to contain roughly
130 burials dating from 1865 to the present (THC 2017).
Information regarding the remaining three previously conducted cultural resources surveys within a 1mile radius of the project area is very limited on the Atlas. In 1979, a cultural resources survey was
performed along lower Onion Creek on behalf of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the
Texas Department of Water Resources, encompassing a large area roughly 0.30 mile north of the current
project area. Another linear survey was conducted in 1987, approximately 0.9 mile northwest of the
current project area. A cultural resources survey was also performed on behalf of the USACE Fort Worth

District in 1999 roughly 0.30 mile northeast of the project area in 1999 (THC 2017). These investigations
resulted in the recording of numerous archaeological sites in the area, some of which are within a 1-mile
radius of the current project area.

HISTORIC MAP REVIEW
The review of the TxDOT Historic Overlay maps revealed two possible historic-age structures and one
cemetery within or immediately adjacent to the APE (Foster et al. 2006). The project area appears to be
titled to Santiago del Valle in 1882 on the 1894 Travis County General Land Office map, although no
structures are depicted. The 1955 Montopolis, Texas, USGS 7.5-minute quadrangle map depicts one
structure within the southwestern portion of the project area along the terminus of a two-track road, and
another structure immediately adjacent, roughly midway along the western margin of the project area at
the terminus of another two-track road. The 1966 Montopolis, Texas, USGS quadrangle map no longer
depicts the structure within the southwestern portion, but does depict the structure roughly midway along
the western margin of the project area. Additionally, both of these maps depict graves followed by the
establishment of a cemetery, presumably the Collins Cemetery, along Cottonmouth School Road at the
current location of the resource.
SWCA conducted a review of historic maps from HistoricAerials.com (2017) to determine if any historicage built resources were located within the project area and to develop an idea of land development over
time. SWCA reviewed topographic maps dated to 1896, 1897, 1910, 1921, 1943, 1956, 1965, 1967, 1970,
1975, 1985, 1988, and 1992, and historic aerial maps dated to 1964, 1966, 1973, 1985, 1986, 1995, 2004,
2008, 2010, and 2012. The same previously discussed structures are depicted on these maps. The Collins
Cemetery first appears on the 1955 topographic map and is consistently represented in the remainder of
topographic maps. On the 1964, 1985, 1995, and 2004 maps, the project area appears to have been used
for a mixture of ranching and agricultural activities with minor disturbances from land clearing and the
construction of the existing roadways. By 2015, extensive residential development in the surrounding area
is quite evident.

FIELD METHODS
SWCAâs investigations consisted of an intensive pedestrian survey with subsurface investigations within
the direct APE. Archaeologists examined the ground surface and extensive exposures for cultural
resources. Subsurface investigations consisted of systematic shovel test excavations. For project areas 2 to
10 acres (0.8â40.5 hectare) in size, the THC survey standards minimally require two shovel tests per acre.
For a project of this size (10.7 acres), the shovel test investigations would require between 21 and 22
shovel tests.
SWCA archaeologists employ both metric (centimeters and meters) and English (inches and feet) units of
measurement when conducting investigations within a project area. In compliance with archaeological
standard practices, investigations such as shovel tests, auger probes, and backhoe trenches are recorded
using metric units. Prehistoric archaeological resources, such as campsites, features, and artifacts, are also
recorded using metric units, whereas historic resources, such as farmsteads and associated historic
features, are recorded using English units; no conversions for these measurements are provided.
SWCA primarily utilized systematic shovel testing throughout the entire project area. The amount of
shovel tests decreased depending on the level of previous disturbances and the nature of the soils. SWCA
did not conduct shovel testing in areas where impervious substrates (i.e., asphalt, concrete, compact
gravel, and/or caliche) were present, within 5 meters (m) of any paved/graveled road edges, within 5 m of
any identified/marked buried utility markers, or where evidence of extensive ground surface disturbance

was observed. Shovel tests were excavated in approximately 20-centimeter (cm) arbitrary levels to
culturally sterile deposits or compact soils, whichever came first.
Archaeologists screened the matrix through Â¼-inch mesh. The location of each shovel test was plotted
using a hand-held sub-meter accurate Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver and was recorded on
appropriate project forms in SWCAâs field tablets. SWCA conducted a non-collection survey; artifacts,
had any been encountered, would have been tabulated, analyzed, and documented in the field, but not
collected. Following the review and acceptance of the final cultural resources report, all records and
photographs will be curated with the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at the University of Texas
at Austin, per requirements of the ACT in accordance with the CTA guidelines.

FIELD SURVEY RESULTS
On January 25, 2017, SWCA archaeologists conducted an intensive pedestrian survey with shovel testing
of the approximately 10.7-acre study area with surface and subsurface investigations as necessary based
on field conditions for the proposed Alternate Pilot Knob Wastewater Interceptor Phase 2B Project
(Figure 3).
Visual examination of the project area revealed primarily agricultural lands and riparian zone on the
gently sloping floodplain and rolling gravelly ridges along Cottonwood Creek within the upland
Blackland Prairie environment. Cottonwood Creek exhibits one main channel with rounded banks and
several shallower channels winding through the floodplain, suggestive of a braided channel network
(Knighton 1998). These channels merge as water flows downstream to create a single channel that is
approximately 3 feet deep and 8 feet wide (Figure 4). This fluvial arrangement is typically associated with
frequent lateral accretion and erosion (Knighton 1998). Accordingly, the lateral movement of the drainage
may affect the integrity of any cultural deposits (if present) that may be buried.
Vegetation throughout the project area consists of tall grasses and short scrub with scattered oaks and
various hardwoods, particularly along the riparian corridor of Cottonmouth Creek, as well as agricultural
fields along the surrounding uplands (Figure 5). Ground surface visibility ranged from 0 to 90 percent,
with clays and moderate to dense surface cobbles and gravels present at ground surface. Previous impacts
observed within the project area include erosion, vegetation clearing and grading, agricultural and
residential activity, two-track roads, fence lines, push piles, utility installations (overhead and subsurface),
residential construction, and impervious cover, such as asphalt and paved areas (Figure 6). SWCA
archaeologists also observed modern debris within the project area, particularly along Cottonmouth
School Road.
Surface examination of the alignment discovered no prehistoric or historic cultural materials within the
APE, with the exception a historic isolated find along the northern margin of the project area and the
Collins Cemetery, located immediately adjacent to the northwestern margin of the APE. The historic
isolated find consists of one stoneware fragment and one light green bottle glass fragment (Figure 7)
situated within an agricultural field. Isolated finds are not eligible as for designation as SALs and do not
warrant further investigations in Texas.
Subsurface examination involved the systematic excavation of 22 shovel tests (MCC01âMCC12 and
TM01âTM10) throughout the project area. These excavations meet the THCâs standards for shovel
testing for projects of this size (see Figure 3; Table 2). Due to very compact soils consisting of very dark
grayish brown to dark gray blocky clays containing 5 to >20 percent cobbles and gravels, shovel testing
only extended to a maximum of approximately 40 cm below surface (cmbs) and discovered no subsurface
cultural materials (see Table 2). Backhoe trenching was not warranted within the APE, as it is within an

Cemetery immediately adjacent to the northern margins of the APE is further discussed below.

COLLINS CEMETERY
The Collins Cemetery was listed as a Historic Texas Cemetery in 2004 (TV-C188) (THC 2017). As
previously mentioned, SWCA investigated the cemetery in 2014 and 2015 during cultural resources
surveys for the Pilot Knob Interceptor and Wastewater Interceptor projects. The current investigations for
the Pilot Knob Wastewater Phase 2B project revisited the cemetery and encountered the same conditions
as the previous investigations.

The Collins Cemetery (also known as the Alexander or Alexander-Collins Cemetery) is located along the
northwest margin of the current APE on the west side of Cottonmouth School Road, approximately
0.15 mile southwest of its intersection with Dee Gabriel Collins Road between two gravel driveways with
modern residences to the north and south (see Figure 3). It is situated on a gentle north-trending slope
within a densely wooded lot containing hackberry trees, green briar, poison ivy, and a thick leaf litter
along the ground surface allowing for low visibility (Figure 8).
The Collins Cemetery is approximately 1 acre in size and contains late-nineteenth- to early-twentiethcentury graves loosely grouped in two separate areas and composed of six headstones and two metal
placards. Group 1 is located 85 feet west of Cottonmouth School Road and consists of three plots all
clearly marked and facing east, with interment dates ranging from the late nineteenth to early twentieth
century (Figure 9). A decorative iron fence is located 20 feet north, oriented roughly east to west. Group 2
is 35 feet south of Group 1 and 50 feet northwest of Cottonmouth School Road, and consists of two plots
within a small fenced area with a third plot just outside the enclosure to the south (Figure 10). The area is
overgrown with vegetation and headstones are tilted or leaning. In addition, archaeologists observed one
illegible, metal placard adjacent to a formal granite headstone. Whether the placard marks an additional
plot or represents the same plot before a formal headstone could be acquired is unknown. In addition to
the two grave groupings and associated metal placard, there is a second illegible metal placard located
approximately 75 feet west-southwest of Group 1. The placard is located next to a mature hackberry tree,
and no additional indication of a burial plot was observed.
Group 1 contains members of the Bremond family. Research conducted on the FindAGrave.com (2017a)
indicates that Vinie Bremond was born Vinie Collins (1856â1912). The other two members in Group 1
include Ben Franklin Bremond (1855â1894), husband of Vinie Bremond, and their child Mollie Bremond
(1894â1894). Group 2 contains the headstone for Newton Isaac (N.I.) Collins, Sr. (1826â1903), a freed
slave who moved to Texas from Alabama in 1863 (FindAGrave.com 2017b). Collins Sr. was born into
slavery in Alabama and later freed before travelling to Texas. He settled near Manor and was re-enslaved
until the end of the Civil War. Collins, Sr. used money he earned as a carpenter to buy and trade land in
east Austin, ultimately acquiring 506 acres near Pilot Knob in 1891 (FindAGrave.com 2017b). Dee
Gabriel Collins (1863â1926), the son of N.I. Collins Sr., is also included in the second grouping, as well
as the infant child (unknownâ1902) of Newton Isaac Collins, Jr.
SWCA also conducted a review of maps from the Texas Historic Overlay and HistoricAerials.com in
order to help determine the limits of the cemetery. SWCA reviewed topographic maps dated to 1894,
1896, 1897, 1910, 1921, 1943, 1932, 1955, 1956, 1965, 1967, 1970, 1975, 1985, 1988, and 1992, and
aerial maps dated to 1964, 1966, 1973, 1985, 1986, 1995, 2004, 2008, 2010, and 2012. Unfortunately, no
prominent fence lines or cemetery boundaries were depicted on the maps. The only boundary indication is
the aforementioned decorative fence located north of Group 1, which was observed during the field
investigations. However, the cemetery contains mature hackberry trees, which are not present to the north
or northwest past the fence. In addition to the drastic vegetation change, extensive land modification
associated with a modern residence to the north and Cottonmouth School Road to the east indicates that
the cemetery probably does not extend in those directions.
Due to the close proximity of the Collins Cemetery, SWCA recommends no construction activities and/or
encroachment along the northwestern margin of the APE west Cottonmouth School Road. The cemetery
is protected under 711.035(f) and 711.010(a)(b) of the Health and Safety Code of Texas with avoidance
required by state law.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
At the request of Brookfield Residential, SWCA conducted an intensive cultural resources survey for the
Alternate Pilot Knob Wastewater Interceptor Phase 2B Project along Cottonmouth Creek in southeast
Austin, Travis County, Texas. The project area is located on lands that will ultimately be owned by a
MUD, a political subdivision of the State of Texas. Investigations were conducted as part of the sponsorâs
compliance with the ACT under TAP No. 7895. Investigations included a background literature review
and an intensive pedestrian survey with shovel testing of the project area. The background literature
review determined that eight cultural resources surveys have been conducted near the proposed project
area; those various investigations, as well as others, resulted in the recording of 13 archaeological sites
within a 1-mile radius of the APE. In addition, two cemeteries are located within a 1-mile radius of the
project area, of which one is situated along the northwest margin of the project area. The review of the
TxDOT Historic Overlay maps revealed two possible historic-age structures and one cemetery within or
immediately adjacent to APE.
The intensive pedestrian survey revealed primarily agricultural lands and associated riparian zone on the
gently sloping floodplain, with rolling gravelly ridges of Cottonwood Creek within the upland Blackland
Prairie environment. Previous impacts to the project area include erosion, vegetation clearing and grading,
agricultural and residential activity, two-track roads, fence lines, push piles, utility installations (overhead
and subsurface), residential construction, and impervious cover, such as asphalt and paved areas. SWCA
met the THCâs subsurface testing requirements through an extensive visual inspection for cultural
materials and the excavation of 22 shovel tests throughout the direct APE. Shovel testing revealed very
compact soils consisting of very dark gray to black blocky clays containing 5 to >20 percent cobbles,
gravels, and pebbles. Cottonwood Creek is associated with frequent lateral accretion and erosion and this,
coupled with previous disturbances within the APE, diminished the potential to identify intact

archaeological deposits. During survey investigations, SWCA identified no surface or subsurface cultural
materials, with the exception of one historic isolated find along the northern margin of the project area,
and the Collins Cemetery immediately adjacent to the northwest margin of the APE.
In accordance with 33 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 800.4, SWCA has made a reasonable and good
faith effort to identify cultural resources properties within the direct APE. No properties were identified
within the APE that may meet the criteria for designation as an SAL, according to 13 Texas
Administrative Code 26.10. Therefore, SWCA recommends that no additional cultural resource
investigations should be warranted within the project area, as currently defined. However, due to the close
proximity of the Collins Cemetery, SWCA recommends avoidance and no encroachment along the
northwestern margin of the APE just west Cottonmouth School Road. The cemetery is protected under
711.035(f) and 711.010(a)(b) of the Health and Safety Code of Texas and avoidance is required by state
law.
