Abstract
On January 4, 2019, aci consulting conducted a cultural resources survey for the
Brazosport Water Authority, Phase I, Well Number 3 (BWA3) Project in Brazoria
County, Texas. The Area of Potential Effect (APE) is defined as the entire 0.95-acre
(0.38-hectare) area for the proposed well, approximately 1,189 feet (362.4 meters)
southwest of the Brazosport Water Authority at 1251 Farm-to-Market (FM) 2004,
Lake Jackson, Texas 77566. The elevation within the APE is approximately 15 feet
above mean sea level (MSL) (Figures 1 and 2). All piping from Well 3 to the BWA
Water Treatment Plant (WTP) will exist entirely in the maintained and active
TxDOT right-of-way (ROW) for FM 2004 (Figure 3).
The project will be funded through the Texas Water Development Board, State
Water Implementation Fund for Texas (SWIFT), thus the project was conducted in
compliance with the Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26.20[2]) under Texas
Antiquities Code permit number 8667, as well as Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended. The survey did not result in the
location of any new archeological sites, historic structures, or additional historic
properties. Based on these results, no further archeological work is recommended.
Records from this investigation will be curated at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL). Joey O’Keefe served as Principal Investigator.

INTRODUCTION

On January 4, 2019, aci consulting conducted a cultural resources survey for the
Brazosport Water Authority, Phase I, Well Number 3 (BWA3) Project in Brazoria
County, Texas. The Area of Potential Effect (APE) is defined as the entire 0.95acre (0.38-hectare) area for the proposed well, approximately 1,189 feet (362.4
meters) southwest of the Brazosport Water Authority at 1251 Farm-to-Market
(FM) 2004, Lake Jackson, Texas 77566. The elevation within the APE is
approximately 15 feet above mean sea level (MSL) (Figures 1 and 2). All piping
from Well 3 to the BWA Water Treatment Plant (WTP) will exist entirely in the
maintained and active TxDOT right-of-way (ROW) for FM 2004 (Figure 3).
Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) prohibited the removal of trees and
vegetation within the APE, making access extremely difficult for heavy
machinery. Due to the issue of access for heavy machinery, the size of the APE (<
1 acre), the APE’s proximity to the disturbed and maintained ROW for FM 2004,
the APE’s location within a flood plain, and the negative findings from previous
surveys within one kilometer of the area, backhoe trenching was not utilized for
this project. In place of trenching, an increased number of shovel tests were
conducted, exceeding the number of tests recommended for a parcel this size.
The project will be funded through the Texas Water Development Board, State
Water Implementation Fund for Texas (SWIFT), thus the project was conducted
in compliance with the Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26.20[2]) under
Texas Antiquities Code permit number 8667, as well as Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended. The investigation will
consist of an intensive pedestrian survey, shovel testing, site recording,
assessment of sites for listing on the national Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
or for designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL), data analysis, and
reporting in accordance with the Texas Historical Commission (THC) and
Council of Texas Archaeologists (CTA) standards.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

Physiography

The APE is located in the Coastal Prairies sub-province of the Gulf Coastal
Plains. The Coastal Prairies run along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, where
deltaic sands slope gently toward the coast (Wermund 1995). The region consists
of mostly grassland and cropland except for riparian areas along the major
streams. The APE for the current project is located approximately 400 meters
north of the Brazos River, and is within a wooded portion of the flood plain that
is mapped as Pecan-Elm Forest (McMahan et al. 1984).
2.2

Geology and Soils

The surface geology is Quaternary alluvium, as is the case on most of the coastal
plain (Barnes 1974). The entire APE is mapped as Pledger clay (Figure 4).
Pledger soil is found on nearly level flood plains and formed from calcareous
stratified clayey alluvium of Holocene age. A typical profile is Ap-A-Bss1-Bss2BCss (NRCS 2018). This soil has a moderate to high potential to contain deeply
buried cultural material. (Abbott 2001) (Figure 5).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

A literature review of the THC Archeological Sites Database (the Atlas) revealed
that no previous cultural resources surveys have been conducted and no
previous archeological sites have been recorded within the APE. However, four
previous investigations have been conducted within the one-kilometer buffer of
the APE. As a result of these previous investigations, two archeological sites have
been recorded within the one-kilometer buffer. Neither of the sites have yet been
determined eligible for listing on the NRHP nor designated as SALs. The
recorded sites include a prehistoric open campsite and a prehistoric shell midden
(Table 1; Figure 6).
Site 41BO192 is a prehistoric campsite recorded by the Braszosport Archeological
Society in 1986. Site 41BO211 is a prehistoric campsite that was recorded by
Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc. for the Lake Jackson Recreation Center
(Beck 2000). No additional sites were located as a result of that survey. Both sites
are surficial expressions of mussel shells and were not investigated below the
surface. The eligibility of both sites is unknown.

There is little information in the Atlas for a survey conducted in 1989, or for a
2000 survey sponsored by the Texas Parks & Wildlife Department. A third
survey was conducted by Paul Price Associates in 2003 for the Buffalo Camp
Bayou Recreational Facility project. No archeological sites were recorded as a
result of the cultural resources survey (Weaver and Schroder 2003). The fourth
survey was conducted by aci consulting in 2015 by Julie Shipp and Robin
Benson-Barnes. No archeological sites were recorded as a result of the
investigations.

METHODS

4.1

Survey Method

An intensive pedestrian survey of the entire APE was conducted to locate any
archeological sites or other historical properties that may be within the APE. The
pedestrian survey was conducted within the 0.95-acre (0.38-hectare) APE (see
Figures 1 and 2).
TWDB prohibited the removal of trees and vegetation within the APE, making
access extremely difficult for heavy machinery. Therefore, backhoe trenching
was not utilized for this project. In place of trenching, an increased number of
shovel tests were conducted, exceeding the number of tests recommended (n = 1)
for a parcel this size.
Ground visibility was less than 30% throughout the APE, and the majority of the
APE (90 to 95%) was inundated as a result of heavy rains from previous days.
Each shovel test was conducted on an elevated area that was not covered by
water. Photographs were taken, and field notes discussing daily progress were
created by the surveyor.

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATION

The proposed APE consists of a 0.95-acre (0.38-hectare) area. The APE was
entered from the west from FM 2004 and was surveyed using 30-meter (90-foot)
transects within the entire APE. The transects began at the southern end of the
APE and traveled horizontally, terminating near the northern boundary. The
survey was conducted under cool, wet conditions in the morning under a cloudy
sky, with sporadic wind gusts. No issues arose during the survey of the APE.
Ground surface was nearly level with elevated pimple mounds. Ground
visibility was less than 30% throughout the APE due to fallen vegetation and
standing water. Vegetation consisted primarily of dwarf palmetto, live oak, cedar
elm, hackberry trees, Pecan trees, holly, mixed grasses, vines, grasses, and weeds
(Figures 7 and 8).
A total of four (n = 4) shovel tests were excavated to determine the presence of
cultural resources within the APE. Each shovel test was conducted on an

elevated area not covered by water. The shovel tests were placed in the
approximate area for, and around the proposed well (Figure 9). However, due to
flooding within the APE, the shovel tests terminated at depths between 20 to 30
centimeters below the surface, at which point water began to seep in from the
base of the test pit. Soils consisted of Munsell 10YR 3/2 and Munsell 10YR 4/3
clays with many fine roots, and mottled (< 5%) with organic inclusions.
Photographs were taken, and field notes discussing daily progress were created
by the surveyor. No cultural resources were located as a result of this
investigation.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

On January 4, 2019, aci consulting conducted a cultural resources survey for the
BWA3 Project in Brazoria County, Texas. The APE is defined as the entire 0.95acre (0.38-hectare) area for the well, approximately 1,189 feet (362.4 meters)
southwest of the Brazosport Water Authority at 1251 FM 2004, Lake Jackson,
Texas 77566. The elevation within the APE is approximately 15 feet above MSL
(see Figures 1 and 2). All piping from Well 3 to the BWA WTP will exist entirely
in the maintained and active TxDOT ROW for FM 2004 (see Figure 3).
The investigation consisted of a pedestrian survey supplemented with shovel
tests (n = 4) and did not result in the location of new or previously recorded
archeological sites, nor any other historic properties. Based on these results, no
further archeological work is recommended. It must be noted that no level of
survey intensity can be guaranteed to locate all cultural features within the APE.
Therefore, should previously-unrecorded cultural resources, including human
remains, be discovered during the course of construction for this project, the City
of Lake Jackson will contact a qualified professional archeologist to assess the
findings.
