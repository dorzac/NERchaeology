Archaeological Survey of the Hutto Bypass Project,
Williamson County, Texas
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Archaeological and Cultural Sciences Group (ACSG) conducted an intensive
archaeological survey of the proposed Hutto Bypass Project Area in south-central
Williamson County, Texas from October 10 to October 21, 2003 (Figure 1). The project
area consists of the 1.77-mile-long, 90-100-ft-wide, county-controlled Right-of-Way
(ROW) of the proposed Hutto Bypass (Figure 2). The Hutto Bypass is proposed to route
traffic from United States Highway (US) 79 and State Highway (SH) 130 around the City
of Hutto. The Area of Potential Effect (APE) consists of the proposed 90-100-ft-wide,
1.77-mile-long, county-controlled ROW and is 20.2 acres. Funding for this project will
come entirely from Williamson County.
A records search was conducted at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL) and the Texas Historical Commissionâs (THC) Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
to locate any previously recorded historic and prehistoric cultural resources within the
project area. With the benefit of this research, a 100% pedestrian survey of the entire
project area was performed. Shovel testing was performed in areas where the soil depth
appeared to exceed 10 cm.
The proposed ROW crosses Carmel Creek approximately midway between the projectâs
western terminus at Haybarn Lane and eastern terminus at County Road (CR) 119. The
proposed ROW also crosses Channel Creek approximately midway between the projectâs
western terminus and the easternmost intersection of the proposed ROW and CR 109.
The creeks, which were not flowing during the survey, contain negligible amounts of
alluvium. Two, small, intermittent drainages cross the ROW between CR 119 and CR
108. These intermittent drainages also contain insignificant alluvial deposits. To test for
deeply buried cultural deposits, one backhoe trench test was performed at Carmel Creek
and two backhoe trench tests were performed at Channel Creek. The backhoe trench
tests tested negative for cultural materials and confirmed the lack of significant alluvial
deposits.
There are no previously recorded sites located within the Hutto Bypass ROW. There is
one previously recorded site, 41WM1022, located near the ROW.
Site 41WM1022, a prehistoric lithic scatter, was previously recorded within the SH 130
ROW, immediately east of Channel Creek and west of the Hutto Bypass ROW (Figure
2). The scatter was first recorded by PBS&J in November 2001 during a cultural
resource survey of the SH 130 ROW. The scatter is sparse, surficial and has been heavily
disturbed by erosion and plowing. No diagnostic artifacts were observed or collected.
During the current archaeological survey, no cultural deposits were found to extend into
the Hutto Bypass ROW.
One newly discovered site, 41WM1087, was found to exist within the Hutto Bypass
ROW. Site 41WM1087 is an early to mid-twentieth century farmstead, most likely
3

associated with tenant farming. The cultural deposits within the ROW are relatively
shallow and compressed or mixed and resting on the surface. The building has
completely collapsed. The site is not eligible for nomination to the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) or as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL) due to poor
structural integrity, twentieth century cultural affiliations, and insignificant architectural
characteristics.
A total of 10 shovel tests were executed within the ROW of the Hutto Bypass Project.
Three of the shovel tests tested positive for cultural materials. These shovel tests were
executed at site 41WM1087. Three backhoe trenches were excavated with negative
results. No artifacts were collected during any part of the archaeological survey.
This report follows the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) guidelines and is designed
to satisfy State and Federal laws and regulations. The findings of the cultural resource
survey and records search are summarized and assessments and recommendations
concerning cultural resources are presented. A brief environmental background is
provided.

INTRODUCTION
ACSG conducted an archaeological survey of the Hutto Bypass Project Area in
Williamson County, Texas on October 10 and October 13, 2003 and excavated backhoe
trenches on October 21, 2003. The project area consists of the 1.77-mile-long, 90-100-ftwide, county-controlled ROW of the proposed Hutto Bypass.
As a State entity, Williamson County is obligated to comply with the Texas Antiquities
Act and the Rules of Practice and Procedure for the Texas Antiquities Act. These rules
are interpreted and enforced primarily by the THC. After a visit to the project location,
an initial scope of work was formulated to comply with the Texas Antiquities code. The
stated goal of the Antiquities Code of Texas is, âto locate, protect, and preserve all sites,
objects, buildingsâ¦, and locations of historical, archeological, educational, or scientific
interest, including but not limited to prehistoric and historical American Indian or
aboriginal campsites, dwellings, and habitation sites, archeological sites of every
characterâ¦within the jurisdiction of the State of Texas.â The THC approved this initial
scope of work and Texas Antiquities Permit #3236 was issued to Sean R. Nash as
principal investigator for ACSG.
Location of the Project Area
The project area is the 1.77-mile-long, 90-100-ft-wide, county-controlled ROW of the
Hutto Bypass of SH 130 (Figure 2). The western terminus of this section of the Bypass is
at the intersection of Haybarn Lane and CR 109, northwest of the City of Hutto. The
section will follow CR 109 east for 1,388 ft. County Road 109 dips to the south at this
point, and the bypass section continues straight for another 1,735 ft, crossing CR 109,
before turning southeast for 1,490 ft. The section turns back east-southeast for 1,069 ft
before intersecting CR 108. The section continues straight through the intersection and

follows the existing CR 164 for 3,638 ft to the sectionâs terminus at the intersection of
CR 164 and CR 119.
Project Description
The Hutto Bypass is proposed to route traffic from US 79 and SH 130 around the City of
Hutto. The bypass will preserve a number of historic buildings and structures as well as
the cultural environment of the small city. The bypass ROW will be 90 ft wide on the
western 1.07 miles between Haybarn Lane and CR 108. The eastern 0.70 miles of the
bypass that follows the ROW of CR 164 will have a 100-ft-wide ROW. Existing ROWâs
throughout the project area are 50 ft wide. Funding for the project will come entirely
from Williamson County. The THC will conduct a TAC review.
Area of Potential Effect
The APE for this project includes the existing ROW and the proposed additional ROW.
The APE in the 1.07-mile-long section of ROW between Haybarn Lane and CR 108 is
11.7 acres. The APE in the 0.70-mile-long section of ROW between CR 108 and CR 119
is 8.5 acres. The total APE is 20.2 acres.
Potential Impacts
The road construction will directly affect all surface areas within the limits of
construction. Sub-surface impacts to 1.5 meters for highway construction are anticipated.
In the deeper sediments of the flood plains, box culverts will be used, limiting the
impacts to soils or sediments to approximately 1 meter. Any additional public access to
the study area will be restricted to the ROW.
Previous Projects and Recorded Sites
A records search was conducted at TARL and the THC to locate any previously recorded
prehistoric and historical archaeological sites and completed surveys. There are no
previously recorded historical or archaeological sites located within the proposed project
area. There are no SAL or NRHP eligible properties in or near the project area.
If there were eligible prehistoric properties in the area, they would typically be sites
buried by alluvium or colluvium or both, rock shelter or cave sites, sites containing
burials, and sites that contain or may contain information that is significant in history or
prehistory. Eligible historic properties are typically sites associated with an important
event, set of events, or person(s) that is important in our past. Eligible historic properties
are also sites that display the characteristics of a class, style, a school of architecture, or a
period of architecture. Historic properties may also be eligible if they contain significant
data. However, the properties must display a high degree of integrity. Historic properties
are usually ineligible if buildings and structures have poor structural integrity or are no
longer present.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
Physiography
Elevations within the Blackland Prairie region range from 300 ft (91 m) to 800 ft (244 m)
AMSL (Texas Parks and Wildlife 1996). The overall landform in the area of the project
is characterized by gently rolling to nearly level uplands dissected by broad, shallow
valleys. Elevations within the APE range from 753 ft (230 m) to 689 ft (210 m) AMSL.
The APE crosses two intermittent creeks, Channel Creek and Carmel Creek. Both creeks
are tributaries of Brushy Creek, which is a tributary of the San Gabriel River. The San
Gabriel River is located approximately 9 km north of the Hutto Bypass. The APE also
crosses two small, ephemeral streams, which are tributaries of Carmel Creek.
Flora and Fauna
Upland soils are comprised of moderately deep clays and support tall-grasses and mixed
stands of post oak, blackjack oak, and mesquite (Texas Parks and Wildlife 1996).
However, the environment at the western terminus of the APE is atypical of the region.
Here, Ashe juniper and prickly pear cactus grows along a ridge top immediately west of
Channel Creek. Within the flood plains of the major creeks, moderately deep alluvium
supports riparian forests. The project area lies within Blairâs (1950) Texan biotic
province and the flora and fauna of the province can be found within the APE.
Geology and Soils
Upper Cretaceous Austin Chalk (Kau) underlies the entire project area. The soils within
the APE are comprised of Branyon-Houston Black-Burleson association soils, which are
âdeep, calcareous and non-calcareous, clayey soils formed in clayey alluvium and marine
clays and shales; on ancient stream terraces and uplandsâ (U.S. Department of
Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service [USDA, SCS] 1983). More specifically, Eddy
very gravelly clay loam on 3-8 percent slopes (EyD), Austin-Whitewright complex on 15 percent slopes (AwC2), Austin silty clay on 1-3 percent slopes (AuB), eroded Houston
black clay on 3-5 percent slopes (HuC2), and Branyon clay on 0-1 percent slopes (BrA)
are found within the ROW. The flood plain of Channel Creek contains frequently
flooded Tinn clay (Tn) and Houston Black Clay (HuB), and the flood plain of Carmel
Creek contains Branyon clay on 1-3 % slopes (BrB) (USDA, SCS 1983).
The soils within the uplands of the APE are generally stable to erosional and are not
conducive to preserving archaeological sites. Prehistoric sites within the upland areas are
likely to be surficial, and components would be compressed within a few centimeters of
the surface or mixed and resting on the surface. Only historic sites, structured prehistoric
sites (e.g., burned rock features), or surficial lithic scatters would likely be encountered in
these settings.
Soils and sediments in the lowlands of the intermittent drainages and small creeks in the
APE typically exhibit erosion balanced by deposition and do not present a favorable
depositional environment for the preservation of archaeological sites (USDA, SCS 1983).
8

However, individual locations may have atypical physiographic features (e.g. paleochannels) and alluvial deposits could accumulate.

PREHISTORIC BACKGROUND
The property falls within the Central Texas archaeological area (Collins 1995).
Prehistoric archaeological sites in Central Texas represent continuous human occupation
starting around 11,500 years ago. Throughout its occupation, hunting and gathering is
believed to be the exclusive resource procurement strategy of prehistoric Central Texans.
Sites have been interpreted to represent relatively short-term occupations. Deeper sites
with large amounts of cultural materials are thought to be camps that were returned to
through the years possibly on a regular basis.
Michael B. Collins (1995) authored a recent synthesis of Central Texas archaeology. The
cultural history summarized here is based in large part on his synthesis. Collins divides
the prehistory of Central Texas into 3 time periods: (1) the Paleo-Indian, (2) the Archaic,
and (3) the Late Prehistoric. Each of these has further been divided into subperiods, such
as early and late. Smaller units of time referred to as âstyle intervalsâ are used to
coincide with the interval of use of a particular point style or group of point styles. These
style intervals can overlap or extend over more than one subperiod. Most, however, can
be used to subdivide the subperiods. Information pertaining to burned rock middens,
specifically, is based primarily on Blackâs (1989) research.
Paleo-Indian (Before 8800 B.P.)
The evidence (e.g., Meltzer 1993) no longer supports the long held belief that North
American Paleo-Indians could be characterized as nomadic bands of big game hunters.
Big game hunting is indicated, particularly in association with Folsom. However, a more
generalized hunting and gathering subsistence is now evidenced at Paleo-Indian sites
across Texas and the rest of North America (e.g., Burger Bluff (41GD30) and Baker
Cave). The relatively mesic conditions that prevailed from about 11,500 B.P. allowed for
a high biomass in central Texas and the surrounding regions (Collins 1995).
Clovis and Folsom style intervals divide Collinsâ early Paleo-Indian period (11,20010,000 B.P.). Clovis is the earliest recognized cultural horizon in central Texas. Clovis
is securely dated to between 11,200 and 10,900 B.P. in radiocarbon years. The WilsonLeonard, Gault, and Pavo Real sites have recently added new data to the study of these
early peoples of what is now Texas. Kincaid Rockshelter and Horn Shelter sites also
have documented Clovis components. Clovis artifacts include prismatic blades, engraved
stones, bola stones and the unique Clovis point (Collins 1995). Clovis points are usually
lanceolate, fluted projectile or lance points (Collins 1998).
The Folsom style interval is not as securely dated, and appears to overlap with Clovis.
The finely retouched and fluted Folsom points are one of the most easily recognized
points made in the Americas. In Folsom times, more than at any other interval, people
were specialized hunters. Bison kills with associated Folsom points remain the typical
Folsom site type. The postulated style intervals following Folsom, known as Plainview
and Dalton-San Patrice, are not well known or clearly defined. However, evidence from
9

sites containing components related to them, such as Horn Shelter 2, indicate an Archaiclike hunter-gatherer lifeway (Redder 1985).
Wilson, Golondrina-Barber, and St. Maryâs Hall style intervals make up Collinsâ (1995)
late Paleoindian subperiod. This subperiod is characterized as intermediate or transitional
between Paleo-Indian and Archaic (Collins 1998:63-4). Burned rock features have been
found associated with all three style intervals of this subperiod, but they are substantially
smaller and less frequent than in the Archaic (Collins 1995).
Archaic (8800-1300 B.P.)
The mesic conditions of the Paleo-Indian period come to an end during the early
subperiod of the Archaic. With the exception of the Bell-Andice-Calf Creek interval of
the middle Archaic subperiod, this was a more xeric time for Central Texas and the
surrounding regions. A jump in the number of ground stone tools, specifically manos and
metates suggests an increased reliance on plant resources (Collins 1995). Central Texas
Archaic sites are characterized by accumulations of heat altered rock, including those
known as burned rock middens.
Three subperiods have been defined for the Central Texas Archaic: (1) early, (2) middle,
and (3) late (Johnson and Goode 1994, Collins 1995). Early Archaic sites (8800-6000
B.P.) are recognized by the presence of Angostura, Early Split Stem, and MartindaleUvalde points. Unifacial Clear Fork tools and Guadalupe bifaces are found in early
Archaic sites along with ground stone tools and other bifacial and unifacial implements.
Early Archaic earth ovens and accumulations of burned rock are found primarily on the
better-watered portions of the Edwardâs plateau, in Live Oak savanna habitats. These
earth ovens and accumulations of burned rock have been considered the technological
antecedents of the classic burned rock middens (Collins 1995). However, at Ft. Hood
seven burned rock middens were carefully dated using AMS. The features spanned from
5500 BC (early Archaic) to 1400 AD (Quigg and Ellis 1994). Two others burned rock
middens in Kerr County have been dated to the early Archaic (Luke 1980). It is possible
that these reported early burned rock ovens and accumulations may represent the same
phenomenon in a different form or stage of development (e.g., incipient).
During the first interval (6000-5000 B.P.) of the middle Archaic subperiod the climate is
somewhat more mesic. Bison populations soared. The technically impressive BellAndice-Calf Creek points were likely made primarily for killing these Bison (Johnson
and Goode 1994). By 5000 B.P., the Bison had dwindled and the climate had become
more xeric again. Burned rock middens were likely used to cook sotol and other
xerophytes that thrived during these dry years (Johnson and Goode 1994:26). The last
thousand years of the middle Archaic (5000-4000 B.P.) are divided into two style
intervals, Taylor and Nolan-Travis.
The late Archaic (4000-1300 B.P.) began during the driest time central Texans had ever
experienced. There was, however, a steady increase in effective moisture until it peaked
in the later part of the late Archaic (Collins 1995). With the increase in effective
moisture came the return of Bison. Six style intervals are recognized for the late Archaic:
(1) Bulverde, (2) Pedernales-Kinney, (3) Lange-Marshall-Williams, (4) Marcos-MontellCastroville, (5) Ensor-Frio-Fairland, and (6) Darl.
10

Late Prehistoric (1300 - ca. 500 B.P., or contact)
The beginning of the late Prehistoric period is defined primarily by the introduction of the
bow and arrow. Pottery was also introduced during this time, but unlike many areas in
Texas and the rest of the New World, hunting and gathering resource procurement
strategies prevailed (Collins 1995). Many documented instances of arrow wounds are
recorded during this period (Prewitt 1974).
The late Prehistoric is divided into early and late subperiods (Jelks 1962). Each
subperiod has a single style interval. The early subperiod is represented by the Austin
style interval and the late subperiod by the Toyah interval (Collins 1995). Scallorn and
Edwards points are diagnostic of the early subperiod and Perdiz is representative of the
Toyah archaeological manifestation.

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
Historic exploration and settlement of the Williamson County area began in the late
seventeenth and early eighteenth century when Spanish explorers traveled through the
region searching for better routes to the missions in East Texas. Captain Alonso De LeÃ³n
followed the Camino Real from San Antonio to Bastrop several times during the 1680s,
and, at least once, he traveled on the Camino de Arriba, which crossed Brushy Creek and
the San Gabriel River. In 1716, Louis Juchereau de St. Denis, a French explorer, and
Captain Domingo Ramon, a Spanish explorer, led an expedition through the area and
camped on the banks of Brushy Creek and the San Gabriel River. They named them
Arroyo do las BendÃ­tas Ãnimas and RÃ­o de San Xavier, respectively. In 1721, Marques
de Aguayo led a large group of soldiers, livestock, and provisions through present-day
Williamson County to replenish supplies at the eastern missions (The City of Round
Rock 1998). In the mid-eighteenth century, the San Xavier missions were established
along the San Gabriel River, just east of the Williamson/Milam County line. By 1753,
drought and disease made the missions uninhabitable and Spanish influence in the area
declined (Odintz 2002a).
Anglo-American influence in the area began with a series of land grants from the
Mexican government in the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth century. In 1835,
continual attacks by indigenous Indians prompted Captain John J. Tumlinson and his
company of Texas Rangers to construct a fort and Indian lookout near the headwaters of
Brushy Creek, in southwestern Williamson County. Tumlinson Fort, as it was called,
was abandoned in 1836 when General Santa Ana invaded Texas (Odintz 2002a).
Following the defeat of General Santa Ana at the Battle of San Jacinto, several veterans
of the battle settled in Williamson County. In 1838, Dr. Thomas Kenney and his family
built a fort on Brushy Creek, in what is now eastern Williamson County. Kenneyâs Fort
became the first civilian settlement in Williamson County. By the 1840s, several
settlements existed along Brushy Creek. However, battles with the indigenous
population were a frequent problem, and numerous settlers, including Kenney, were
killed by Indians. By 1846, the Indian resistance has weakened, and settlers moved into
the region in increasing numbers. In 1848, the Texas legislature established Williamson
County, naming it after Robert Williamson, a Milam County Judge and state senator.
11

By 1850, the county had a population of 1,379 whites and 155 slaves. Most of the
population was located in the eastern part of the county on Brushy Creek and the San
Gabriel (Odintz 2002a), but a few families were living in the western half.
During the 1850âs and 1860âs, towns, lumber mills, and tanneries sprang up around the
county. Although urbanization and industrialization increased somewhat, the bulk of the
county remained rural and agricultural. The majority of the families lived on subsistence
farms in log houses and raised corn. During the 1850s and early 1860s, the slave
population increased and the agricultural patterns within the county became more diverse.
Wheat and corn were the predominant crops in the blackland prairies, and cattle and
sheep ranching was widespread throughout the county, but particularly widespread in the
hilly regions west of the Balcones Escarpment (Nash et al. 2002). Cotton was introduced
in 1850s, but it was not a significant cash crop.
The economy of Williamson County slumped during the Civil War, but picked up again
in the 1870s with the growth of the cattle and sheep industry and the expansion of cotton
farming. The cattle industry was sustained by the Chisolm trail, which was established in
1864 and passed close to Round Rock. Many cattle drives passed through or originated
in Williamson County. The 1870s and 1880s was also marked by the arrival of railroads
to Williamson and Travis County (Odintz 2002a).
The City of Hutto was founded in 1876 with the arrival of Williamson Countyâs first
railroad, the International-Great Northern Railroad. The community was named after
James Emory Hutto, a local rancher on whose land the railroad station was built. By
1884, the town had 200 residents, a school, three churches, and five cotton gins. By the
early 1890s, a bank and hotel had been constructed, and by 1896, the town had 700
residents (Odintz 2002b).
By the early-twentieth century, cotton farming had preceded the cattle industry in
Williamson County. Many rural railroad communities, like Hutto, prospered as cotton
processing and shipment centers. The economy of Hutto was based primarily on cottonrelated activities (e.g., cotton gins and railroad shipping) (Odintz 2002b).
With the dramatic growth in cotton farming, a shift in farm tenancy developed. As late as
1880, 77 percent of the farms were still worked by owners. By 1890, 43 percent of the
farms were worked by owners. By 1930, only 29 percent of the farms were worked by
owners. The tenancy rates dropped during the Great Depression (Odintz 2002a) as many
tenant farmers either moved away or turned to other occupations. By 1931, the
population in the City of Hutto had fallen from its peak of 900 in 1928 to 538 (Odintz
2002b).
The cotton industry in Williamson County and in the City of Hutto suffered economically
during the 1920s from the effects of soil depletion, falling prices brought on by
overproduction, and the boll weevil infestation. The Great Depression of the 1930s
worsened the economic situation and encouraged farmers to shift away from cotton to
livestock. Cotton production was reduced by nearly half, while sorghum and wheat
became important crops. Along with cattle and sheep, poultry farming intensified
(Odintz 2002a).
12

Significant population and economic changes occurred in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.
The construction and expansion of roads throughout the undeveloped areas of
Williamson County meant rural populations now had easier access to the urban areas and
vice versa. The consolidation of rural schools also meant children could now attend
schools outside of their rural communities.
Suburbanization of the portions of the county bordering Austin caused the population of
Williamson County to boom in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1970, the population of
Williamson County was 37,305. By 1982, the population had grown to over 85,700
(Odintz 2002a). A pattern of absentee ownership and of non-agricultural use of the land
also intensified following World War II.
Local development in the mid-1980s brought a growth spurt to Hutto, whose population
had increased to 630 by 1990 (Odintz 2002b). Today, the majority of the area
surrounding Hutto is rural and agricultural with cotton, corn, and sorghum being the
predominant crops. However, residential development is continually expanding from the
suburbs of Round Rock to the outskirts of Hutto. Many of the farms west of Hutto are
being subdivided and developed as residential neighborhoods.

PREVIOUSLY RECORDED ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES
A records search was conducted at TARL and the THC to locate any previously recorded
prehistoric and historical archaeological sites and completed surveys. No sites have been
recorded in the project area. One site, 41WM1022, has been recorded near the project
area (i.e., approximately 200 m southwest of Hutto Bypass ROW)
Site 41WM1022 is a prehistoric lithic scatter located in a plowed field south of CR 109
and east of Channel Creek (Figures 2 and 3). The site was recorded by PBS&J
archaeologists in November 2001 during a cultural resource survey of the SH 130 ROW.
The site measures approximately 130 m (north-south) x 30 m (east-west) and has been
heavily disturbed by routine plowing and erosion. Ten shovel tests were executed at the
site and all tested negative for artifacts. Surficial artifacts include bifaces, modified
flakes, debitage, and a projectile point perform. No diagnostic artifact or cultural features
were recorded. The recorder recommended no further investigation of the site.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SENSITIVITY PROFILE
Prior to the archaeological survey, ACSG conducted an archaeological sensitivity profile
of the project area to determine areas of high and low probability for intact archaeological
sites. The sensitivity profile is based on data collected from:
(1) a records search at TARL and the THC to locate any previously recorded sites and
completed surveys,
(2) a study of the soils and land forms to delimit areas with the potential for buried sites,
(3) a study of aerial photographs, old county highway maps, and early GLO plat maps to
look for historic properties and historically important property owners, and
(4) a reconnaissance of the ROW to look for obvious disturbances within the project area.
13

The prospect of finding intact archaeological sites varies with the physiographic settings
within the APE. Two distinct physiographic settings were identified: (1) uplands, and (2)
small creeks and intermittent drainages.
Uplands
The age of the geologic formations within the APE is Upper Cretaceous and predates
known human occupation of the region. Routine contour plowing has directly or
indirectly impacted all areas within the APE (see Figure 2). All upland settings within
the APE have been directly impacted. Upland soils are formed in situ and because of the
low relief and stable clay soils surfaces are generally stable.
In the Central Texas Archaeological region, sites in upland areas are likely to be surficial
with all components compressed within a few centimeters of the surface or mixed and
resting on the surface (Black 1989). Any sites of this nature would have been heavily
disturbed by contour plowing and have minimal research value. Previously recorded
sites in the area fit this pattern. Upland areas have a low probability for containing intact
archaeological sites.
Small Creeks and Intermittent Drainages
Soils and sediments in the lowlands of the intermittent drainages and small creeks in the
APE typically exhibit erosion balanced by deposition and do not present a favorable
depositional environment for the preservation of archaeological sites (USDA, SCS 1983).
However, individual locations may have atypical physiographic features (e.g. paleochannels) and alluvial deposits could accumulate. Small Creeks and Intermittent
Drainages, specifically Channel Creek and Carmel Creek, have a higher potential for
containing intact, buried archaeological sites than the upland areas. Backhoe trenching
would be implemented at Channel Creek and Carmel Creek to test for the presence of
alluvium and deeply buried cultural deposits.

INTENSIVE SURVEY
Methods
A 100% pedestrian survey was conducted to âidentify obvious or well known propertiesâ
and âareas where certain kinds of properties are likely to occurâ [36 CFR Â§ 64] (Derry et.
al. 1985, King et. al. 1977). These include both historic and prehistoric-aged properties.
A thorough records search was completed in order to determine: (1) if there were any
recorded sites within the project area; and (2) the nature of the recorded sites in the
general area. Based on this data, a strategy for an intensive archaeological survey of the
project area was devised. The survey strategy included a 100% pedestrian survey and
sub-surface testing. Separate methodologies of sub-surface testing were employed for
areas with a high probability of buried sites and areas with a low probability.
Sites as defined by Hester et al. (1997:42) are âany discrete bounded location where
humans lived, worked, or carried out a task - and where evidence of their behavior can be
recovered by the archaeologist.â For practical purposes, any area where three or more
14

artifacts were found within a 10-m diameter was recorded. Isolated artifacts would be
plotted on a USGS 7.5â topographic map.
Pedestrian Survey
The revised minimum survey standards, as implemented by the THC, for project areas of
200 acres or less require a transect interval no greater than 30 m. Ten-meter transects
were walked across the entire APE. Smaller transects would be employed in areas that
evidenced historic or prehistoric sites. Due to numerous, recently plowed fields, the
overall ground visibility was excellent and allowed for a confident appraisal of the APE.
Areas of better visibility within the poor visibility areas received additional attention. If
an artifact were found, the surrounding area would be cleared and carefully searched.
Notes were taken describing conditions, environmental factors, and any other factors
affecting the survey. Furthermore, photographs were taken of environmental settings,
cultural artifacts, and features encountered during the survey. All naturally exposed
profiles were examined.
The soils within the APE are generally stable to erosional and are not conducive to
preserving archaeological sites. Prehistoric sites within the upland areas are likely to be
surficial, and components would be compressed within a few centimeters of the surface
or mixed and resting on the surface. Only structured sites, like burned rock middens, or
surficial lithic scatters would likely be encountered in these settings. If surficial sites
were encountered, a random sample of artifacts would be field-identified to quantify the
density of the scatter and the types of artifacts present. No artifacts were collected during
any part of the survey.
If any previously recorded sites were located within the Hutto Bypass APE, they would
be revisited and reassessed for potential significance. Newly discovered sites were
investigated and recorded at TARL. If the surface visibility at the sites is less than 30
percent, then a minimum of six shovel tests were executed to delimit site boundaries.
Based on the results of the shovel tests and surface inspection, the newly recorded sites
were evaluated for potential significance.
Sub-surface Examination
Shovel Testing
The minimum survey standards for Texas, as implemented by the THC, require 16 shovel
tests per mile in a linear project, unless the geomorphology or terrain conditions
demonstrate that this number is unnecessary. Based on the background research and an
environmental assessment, a scope of work was formulated to account for the presence of
highly disturbed agricultural areas.
Fewer shovels tests than the number required by the minimum survey standards (i.e., 16
per mile, per 100-ft width of new ROW) were anticipated in the project area.
Calculations show that there is the equivalent of 1.182 miles of new 100- ft-wide ROW
(length x width of new ROW / 100 ft / 5280) (Figure 3). The minimum survey standards
would require 19 shovel tests.
15

The subsequent pedestrian survey results confirmed that the majority of the project area
is located in an upland setting with heavily plowed surfaces. With this in mind, shovel
tests were conducted at the Principal Investigatorâs discretion (Figure 4). A total of 10
shovel tests were performed.

Shovel tests were placed in areas where the soils and sediments appeared to be relatively
intact. In order to confirm the absence of buried, intact archaeological sites, some shovel
tests were placed in areas that contained thin soils or were disturbed by cultivation or
other agricultural activities. Areas where soil profiles were naturally exposed through
erosion were also examined. Shovel tests were 30 cm in diameter and were excavated to
the bottom of Holocene deposits, if possible. Positive shovel tests were dug in levels no
thicker than approximately 20 cm. Negative shovel tests that contained sterile,
homogenous clay were dug in levels corresponding to the natural stratigraphic
boundaries. Excavated sediments were screened through Â¼-inch hardware cloth unless
high clay or water content required that the material be troweled through or sorted by
hand. Shovel test locations were mapped by global positioning systems (GPS). Notes
were taken describing the zone, depth, soils, stratigraphy, and any artifacts found. If a
site were located during the pedestrian survey, additional sub-surface testing would be
conducted to evaluate the depth and nature of cultural deposits. The minimum survey
standards for Texas require at least 6 shovel tests to define site boundaries, unless the site
has more than 30 percent surface visibility.
The uplands of the APE are low probability areas. Upland soils are formed in situ and
because of the low relief and stable clay soils surfaces are generally stable. Sites formed
in upland settings on stable clay surfaces are likely surficial or mixed and compressed
within the top few centimeters. These surficial sites will most likely be sparse lithic
scatters, burned rock features, or historic sites.
Due to contour plowing of the project area, all upland surface sites within the project area
are thoroughly disturbed. Upland areas were ground-truth tested with at least one shovel
test. If ground truth testing showed a favorable depositional environment for buried sites,
additional shovel tests would be performed.
In high probability areas, where alluvium or colluvium could accumulate, buried sites are
far more likely. For this reason, shovel testing was concentrated in these areas.
However, streams within the project area typically exhibit erosion balanced by deposition
and do not develop significant alluvium deposits or terraces. If initial shovel tests
16

showed a poor depositional environment, fewer shovel tests than required under the
minimum standards would be performed.
Overall, the soils within the project area are clay soils that were formed during the
Pleistocene or earlier and predate known human occupation of the region. These soils are
stable to erosional and have a low probability of containing buried cultural deposits.
Backhoe Testing
Testing of areas that may contain deeply buried sites is required by the THC minimum
Standards. Proposed locations of bridges or any other constructions that may impact
alluvium deeper than 1 m were tested with a minimum of one backhoe (Figure 5). A total
of three (3) backhoe trenches were excavated.

17

trench. The backhoe trenches were approximately 4 m to 8 m long, 2 m wide and were
dug to the water table, bedrock, or the reach of the backhoe. Profiles were examined,
described, and photographed.
Representative profiles were also drawn and/or
photographed.

RESULTS
Pedestrian Survey
For the pedestrian survey and subsequent shovel testing, the project area was divided into
four sections based on existing road sections and geographic characteristics.
CR 119 to CR 108
The section between CR 119 and CR 108 follows the existing CR 164 ROW. This
section has been heavily disturbed by previous road construction (i.e., CR 164), routine
contour plowing, and sub-surface utilities. The majority of the southern side of the
ROW, south of CR 164 has been recently plowed (Figure 5). The remaining portions of
the ROW are comprised of fallow fields and livestock pastures. The fallow portions of
the ROW have been extensively plowed in the past. Four modern houses and associated
outbuildings are located north of CR 164. The areas adjacent to the houses have also
been routinely plowed. Overall surface visibility in this section is good to excellent due
to the recently plowed fields and lack of vegetation.
A small intermittent drainage is located approximately 320 m west of the eastern
terminus of the ROW. The drainage has been thoroughly altered by agricultural activities
and contains negligible alluvium (Figure 5).
Approximately 800 m west of the eastern terminus, the ROW gradually descends to
Carmel Creek. The northern and southern sides of the CR 164 are bounded by large
pastures. Prominent, artificial terraces suggest that the pastures were routinely cultivated
in past.
A second intermittent drainage is located approximately 100 m east of the intersection of
CR 108 and CR 164. The drainage has been altered by agricultural activities and erosion
and contains negligible alluvium (Figure 6). North of CR 164, grade-control structures
have been placed in the drainage channel upslope to prevent erosion (Figure 6).
An early to middle twentieth century house site is located approximately 225 m east of
the intersection of CR 108 and CR 164. The site is located roughly 14 m north of CR 164
in the same field as the grade-control structures. The site is comprised of a collapsed
building and sparse artifact scatter located on an artificial terrace in a large pasture.
No prehistoric artifacts or features were observed in this section.

22

CR 108 to CR 109
Immediately west of the intersection of CR 108 and CR 164, the ROW crosses a recently
plowed field (Figure 7). Surface visibility in this section is good to excellent due to the
lack of vegetation and recently turned soil.
Approximately 220 m northwest of the intersection of CR 108 and CR 164, Carmel
Creek crosses the ROW. Surface visibility along the creek channel is poor due to heavy
vegetation. The creek was dry during the survey and appears to have been dry for some
time. The creek channel is very shallow and does not contain any significant alluvium.
A 1985 USGS topographic map of the project area shows a dammed stock tank
immediately south of the ROW.
West of Carmel Creek, the ROW turns northwest and crosses a second recently plowed
field (Figure 7). The ROW intersects with CR 109 at the northern boundary of the field.
At this point, the ROW turns westward and crosses another plowed field.
No artifacts or cultural features were observed in this section
CR 109 to CR 109
North of CR 109, the ROW turns westward and crosses a recently plowed field (Figure
8). Surface visibility in the plowed field is excellent.
Approximately 330 m west of the intersection of the ROW and CR 109, the ROW crosses
Channel Creek (Figure 8). The banks of Channel Creek are heavily wooded with large
deciduous trees, shrubs, green briar, and poison ivy. Surface visibility is poor to fair
along the creek channel due to heavy vegetation.
A large concrete dam was discovered at the northern edge of the ROW. The eastern
portion of the dam has been breached by high-energy stream currents. Modern household
trash and construction refuse was observed along the creek channel, both upstream and
downstream of the dam.
No artifacts or prehistoric features were observed in this section
CR 109 to Haybarn Lane
Immediately west of Channel Creek, the Hutto Bypass ROW converges with CR 109 and
follows CR 109 to the projectâs western terminus at Haybarn Lane. The southern portion
of the ROW south of CR 109 has been routinely plowed. The northern portion of the
ROW north of CR 109 is comprised of modern residences. The surface visibility is good
to excellent in the plowed fields and fair in grassy areas.
The ROW ascends a ridge slope west of Carmel Creek (Figure 9). The soils become
shallower with elevation. In the recently plowed field south of CR 109, the dark grayish
brown clays give way to light brown sandy clay with many angular limestone fragments
on the surface. This suggests that routine plowing is breaking up shallow bedrock and

bringing fragments to the surface. Near the summit of the ridge at Haybarn Lane,
bedrock outcrops on the surface (Figure 9). Vegetation along the ridge top is comprised
of Ashe juniper, tall grasses, prickly pear cactus, and scattered oaks
No artifacts or cultural features were observed in this section.
Newly Recorded Sites
41WM1087
Description:
Site 41WM1087 is located in an open field, on a slope that gradually descends to Carmel
Creek. The field is currently used as a livestock pasture. However, artificial terraces,
which follow the contours of the field, suggest the field had been cultivated in the past.
The site is located on one of these terraces. Vegetation within the field consists entirely
of pasture grass. No livestock was observed during the survey.
The site is marked by the remains of small house (Figure 10), which measures
approximately 27.5 ft (north-south) x 12.5 ft (east-west). The house appears to have been
an early to middle twentieth century shotgun-style house. The building rests on a pier
and beam foundation (all wood) and appears to have had board-and-batten siding and
corrugated metal roofing. The house has completely collapsed, and the majority of the
construction materials are piled at the center of the building. A collapsed, brick and
cement chimney or stove flue is also located at the center of the building. The concrete
foundation of the chimney or stove is still intact. The building is constructed of
dimensional lumber and wire nails (except for the foundation piers, which are hewn
logs). No window or door openings are apparent. Numerous household artifacts are
concentrated beneath the house and immediately adjacent to the house. A sparse scatter
of artifacts extends down slope to an ephemeral drainage west of the site. The scatter
measures approximately 90 ft (east-west) x 200 ft (north-south).
Cultural Materials Collected/Observed:
Numerous food-related items, such as whole and fragmentary glass containers (e.g., milk
jars, canning jars), tin cans, soft drink cans, and cooking utensils, were observed. All
glass containers are machine-made, mid-twentieth century artifacts. Clothing materials,
which include remnants of fabric, womenâs and babiesâ shoes, and several rubber shoe
soles, are present. An electric clothing iron was also observed. Childrenâs items
comprise a large portion of the assemblage. These artifacts include doll parts, several
babiesâ shoes, the frame of what appears to be a highchair, and a rubber bulb syringe.
Building-related artifacts include boards, corrugated sheet metal, various scraps of
aluminum, and bricks. A mid-twentieth century BF Goodrich tire and a 1959 Texas
license plate were also observed.

Assessment:
The site appears to be an early to middle twentieth century shotgun house, most likely the
house of a tenant farmer. Although the shotgun style is typical of 1900sâ1940s tenant
farming houses, the bulk of the artifacts associated with the house appear to be midtwentieth century items (i.e., post WWII). Given the deteriorated nature of the house and
the relative age of the artifacts, the house appears to have been last occupied in the 1950s
or early 1960s. The house is located on an artificial terrace on a ridge slope. Slope wash
has transported many artifacts down slope toward an ephemeral drainage west of the site.
The cultural deposits at the site are for the most part surficial, and areas adjacent to the
building appear to have been disturbed by erosion and probable plowing.
Based upon archival research conducted by an architectural historian, the historic-age
property is a modest mid-20th century example of common agricultural types lacking in
both structural and architectural integrity. Furthermore, Site 41WM1087 is not
associated with a historical figure or event of outstanding importance. As a result of the
latter and former findings, Site 41WM1087 does not meet any of the National Register
criteria for significance and is recommended Not Eligible for NRHP listing. The Historic
Resources Report Addendum can be found in Appendix 3.
Due to poor structural integrity and insignificant twentieth century affiliations, the site is
not eligible for nomination as a SAL or to the NRHP. The site represents a negligible
cultural resource and does not warrant further investigation.
Shovel Test Results
A total of ten shovel test were executed in the Hutto Bypass APE. Three shovel tests that
were executed at site 41WM1087 tested positive for cultural materials. All other shovel
tests tested negative for cultural materials. Because of the heavily disturbed nature of the
project area (i.e., routine plowing, past road construction, and buried utilities), fewer
shovel tests than the minimum survey standards require were executed within the APE.
Shovel Tests 1-6 were executed in the section of ROW between CR 119 and CR 108.
Shovel Test 1 (Figure 11) was executed in a fallow field on the northern side of CR 164,
roughly 200 m west of the westernmost house on the northern side of the road. The
shovel test contains dark grayish brown silty clay at 0-12 cmbs. This level appears to be
a plow zone. At 12-35 cmbs, extremely dense, dark grayish brown clay was encountered.
Shrink-swell cracks were observed at 25 cmbs, and common, small limestone flecks and
marine fossils were observed throughout. The matrix becomes more clayey with depth.
No cultural materials were found in this shovel test.
Shovel Tests 2-5 were executed at site 41WM1087.
Shovel Test 2 (Figure 11) was conducted approximately 3 m east of the house. The soil
profile contains brown silty clay at 0-10 cmbs with many grass roots and rootlets. At 1029 cmbs, the shovel test contains mottled tan and brown silty clay that becomes siltier
and tanner in color with depth. Few subrounded to rounded limestone pebbles and
marine fossils were observed. No artifacts were found in ST 2.
29

Shovel Test 3 was executed approximately 4 m north of the house. The soil profile in ST
3 is similar to the soil profile in ST 2. However, a scrap of red fabric and a clear glass
fragment were found at 0-5 cmbs. No other artifacts were found.

30

Figure 12. Top-ST 1. Bottom-ST 2.

Shovel Test 4 was conducted approximately 5 m west of the house. At 0-15 cmbs, the
soil profile contains brown silty clay with few rocks. Two clear glass fragments and six
white plastic fragments were found at 0-10 cmbs. At 15-30 cmbs, tan silty clay was
encountered. The matrix contains a few small limestone pebbles, several marine shell
fossils, and one large fossilized bivalve shell. No artifacts were found in this level.
Shovel Test 5 was executed roughly 5 m south of the house. The shovel test contains
grayish brown silty clay at 0-18 cmbs. A wire nail was found at 0-10 cmbs. At 18-25
cmbs, the soil profile contains very dense tan/buff silty clay. No artifacts were found
below 10 cm.
Shovel Test 6 (Figure 12) was conducted on the eastern bank of an intermittent drainage
located between site 41WM1087 and CR 108. The shovel test contains grayish brown
silty clay at 0-16 cmbs. This level appears to be a plow zone. At 16-50 cmbs, the soil
profile revealed dense, dark grayish brown clay with a few fossils and subrounded to
rounded limestone pebbles. The matrix becomes denser with depth and shrink-swell
cracks become evident. No artifacts were found in ST 6.
Shovel Test 7 was executed in the section of ROW between CR 108 and CR 109. The
shovel test was conducted on the eastern bank of Carmel Creek. The shovel test profile
contains homogenous dark grayish brown to black clay at 0-50 cmbs. Ped formation is

31

evident throughout. Limestone flecks begin at approximately 20 cmbs. However, few
rocks were observed. No artifacts were found in ST 7.
Shovel Tests 8 and 9 were executed in the section of ROW between the first intersection
with CR 109 and the section intersection with CR 109. The shovel tests were conducted
on the banks of Channel Creek. Shovel Test 8 was executed on the western bank of the
creek. The shovel test contains brown clay loam and leaf litter at 0-5 cmbs. A 5-12
cmbs, road base was encountered. The road base, which appears to have eroded down
slope from CR 109, is comprised of angular and subangular limestone pebbles, crushed
limestone, and sand. At 12-55 cmbs, the soil profile contains dense, dark grayish brown
clay with roots and rootlets throughout. Few subangular limestone pebbles and marine
fossils are present in this level. No artifacts were found in ST 8.
Shovel Test 9 was executed on the eastern bank of Channel Creek. The shovel test
contains homogenous dark grayish brown clay that becomes darker in color and more
clayey with depth. The shovel test contains roots and rootlets throughout and very few
rocks. No artifacts were found in ST 9.
Shovel Test 10 (Figure 12) was executed in the section of ROW between CR 109 and
Haybarn Lane. The shovel test was executed near the summit of a ridge on the northern
side of CR 109. At 0-25 cmbs, the soil profile contains gray clay loam with few rocks
and many grass roots and rootlets throughout. The matrix is slightly browner at 0-5
cmbs. Degrading bedrock was exposed at 25 cmbs. No artifacts were found in this
shovel test.

Backhoe Trench Test Results
Three backhoe trench tests were executed within the Hutto Bypass ROW. One was
executed at Carmel Creek, and two were executed at Channel Creek.
Backhoe Trench Test (BHT) 1 (Figure 13) was executed on the eastern bank of Carmel
Creek, within a recently plowed field. The backhoe trench test revealed Branyon clay on
1 to 3 percent slopes. The upper 30 cm of the soil profile has been heavily disturbed by
routine plowing. Beneath the plow zone, an undisturbed stratum of dark gray clay was
uncovered to a depth of 70 cmbs. At 70-155 cmbs, the profile contains gray clay, and at
155-200 cmbs, the profile contains light gray clay. No cultural materials were found in
BHT 1.
Backhoe Trench Test 2 was executed on the eastern bank of Channel Creek, immediately
west of a recently plowed field. The backhoe trench test revealed Houston Black clay on
1 to 3 percent slopes (Figure 14). The upper 35 cm of the soil profile appears to have
been disturbed by historic plowing. Beneath the plow zone, the soil profile contains dark
grayish brown clay to 120 cmbs. At 120-160 cmbs, the soils profile contains dark gray
clay. Below 160 cmbs, gray clay was encountered. No cultural materials were found in
BHT 2.
Backhoe Trench Test 3 was executed in a heavily wooded area on the western bank of
Channel Creek. The backhoe trench test revealed frequently flooded Tinn clay (Figure
15). The soil profile contains dark grayish brown silty clay with many roots and rootlets
at 0-40 cmbs. A gray silty layer was encountered at 40-50 cmbs. Below the silty layer,
the soils profile contains dark gray clay to a depth of 210 cmbs. No cultural materials
were found in BHT 3.

CONCLUSIONS
Results of the archaeological survey show that the majority of the APE has been
thoroughly disturbed by past road construction (i.e., CR 164 and CR 109) and routine
contour plowing.
One previously recorded site, 41WM1022, is located near the ROW. The site is a
prehistoric lithic scatter that was recorded in 2001 during a cultural resource survey of the
SH 130 ROW. The site is located in a plowed field between the Hutto Bypass ROW and
Channel Creek. No portion of the site was found to extend into the APE, and it will not
be impacted by the project.
One newly recorded site, 41WM1087, was found to exist within the Hutto Bypass ROW.
The site is comprised of the remains of an early to mid-twentieth century shotgun house
and an associated artifact scatter. The site may have been the residence of a tenant family
and appears to have been occupied as late as the 1950s or 1960s, as a 1959 automobile
license plate suggests. Shovel test results indicate that the cultural deposits are shallow
(â¤10 cmbs) to surficial and appear to represent a single twentieth century component.
The areas adjacent to the house appear to have been heavily disturbed by erosion and

plowing. Due to poor structural integrity and insignificant twentieth century affiliations,
the site is not eligible for nomination as a SAL or to the NRHP. The site represents a
negligible cultural resource and does not warrant further investigation.
The APE was shovel tested for buried cultural deposits and the presence of alluvial
deposits. All shovel tests tested negative for prehistoric cultural materials and revealed
poor depositional environments, in which the preservation of archaeological deposits
were impeded by erosion and routine plowing Three shovel tests executed at site
41WM1087 tested positive for historical artifacts. The artifacts, including a wire nail
found in ST 5 and several pieces of plastic found in ST 4, are clearly indicative of a
twentieth century occupation. For these reasons, the APE possesses minimal potential for
intact archaeological sites.
Creeks and intermittent drainages within the APE are generally erosional or exhibit
erosion balanced by deposition. Typically, this type of depositional environment does
not result in significant alluvial deposition or terrace formation. Preservation of intact
archaeological sites in this depositional environment is unlikely (USDA, SCS 1983). The
creeks and intermittent drainages within the APE were shovel tested for buried cultural
deposits and the presence of alluvial deposits. Backhoe trenches were excavated in areas
that tested positive for alluvial deposits deeper than 1 meter. However, no buried,
prehistoric cultural materials were found in any of the shovel tests or backhoe trenches.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No further archaeological work is warranted for the Hutto Bypass Project Area. It is
ACSGâs recommendation that construction of the Hutto Bypass be allowed to proceed at
this time. If any cultural remains are encountered during construction, all work should
cease, and an ACSG professional archaeologist should be called to assess the site. If the
site is assessed to be significant, further consultation with the State Historic Preservation
Officer should be pursued.

Hutto Bypass Project
Williamson County, TX
Introduction
In October 2003, the Archaeological and Cultural Sciences Group of Austin, TX
submitted the report, Archaeological Survey of the Hutto Bypass Project â Williamson
County, Texas, to Williamson County for review. In the report, the archaeologists
identified Site 41WM1087 as being within the area of potential effects (APE) of the
Hutto Bypass (see Appendix A: Historic Resource Location Map). The APE of this
project was the right of way (ROW). The site was described as âan early to midtwentieth century farmstead [structure], most likely associated with tenant farmingâ and
that â[t]he building has completely collapsed.â The archaeologists recommended the site
as not eligible for either the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or as a State
Archeological Landmark (SAL) due to lack of structural and architectural integrity and
lack of cultural significance.
On November 28, 2006, in response to the report, the Texas Historical Commission
determined the necessity of âarchival research documentation that support[s] the
conclusion that site 41WM1087 is a mid-20th century site.â
This document addresses the results and conclusions from the archival research of this
historic resource, as well as recommendations of NRHP eligibility.

Records Review
A desk-top review was conducted of the Hutto area to more clearly estimate the age of
the collapsed structure at Site 41WM1087. On-line websites visited included the Texas
Historical Commission Historic Sites Atlas for NRHP, SALs, and Recorded Texas
Historic Landmarks (RTHL) information, and the Texas State Library & Archives
Commission Website. Files researched included historic soil surveys, topographic maps
(see Appendix B for 1925, 1982, and 1987 maps), and aerial photographs (see Appendix
C for 1942, 1958, 1964, 1988, 1996, and 2004 photos).

Historic Resources
A review of the NRHP, the list of SALs, and the list of RTHLs indicates that no
historically significant resources have been previously documented within the APE.
Based on a review of historic and modern topographic maps (1925, 1982, and 1987) and
aerial photographs (1942-2004), it appears that Site 41WM1087 appears on the Hutto
1987 map and the July 22, 1988 aerial image, but does not appear on earlier aerials and
maps. This indicates that the structure was built some time between 1964 and 1987.
Therefore, Site 41WM1087 may be marginally historic-age.

Conclusion
Based upon archival research, the historic-age property is a modest mid-20th century
example of common agricultural types lacking in both structural and architectural
integrity. Furthermore, Site 41WM1087 is not associated with a historical figure or event
of outstanding importance. As a result of the latter and former findings, Site 41WM1087
does not meet any of the National Register criteria for significance and is recommended
Not Eligible for NRHP listing.
