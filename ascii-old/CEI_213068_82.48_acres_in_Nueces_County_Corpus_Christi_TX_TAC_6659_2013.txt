Introduction
Coastal Environments, Inc. (CEI) was contracted by Weston Solutions, Inc. of Houston,
Texas under the Weston Purchase Order #0083864 to conduct a Phase I archaeological survey on
82.48 acres (33.38 hectares) owned by the Port of Corpus Christi Authority (POCCA). The tract
of land will be leased by Castleton Commodities International who plan to build a condensate
splitter. The subject property is located along the north shore of the ship channel, south of Carbon
Plant Road in Nueces County, Texas (Figures 1 and 2).

In accordance with the Council of Texas Archeologists Guidelines, reconnaissance and
shovel testing were conducted on September 17 and 18, 2013 using 32 person-hours. CEI
archaeologists S. Morehead and J. Pringle excavated 23 shovel tests within the subject property
under Texas Antiquities Permit #6659 and under Permit USACE-C-1814. Due to heavy rains in
the Corpus Christi area prior to the survey, much of the area was inundated at the time of survey,
however, in some areas where water was not standing, the ground visibility was greater than 70
percent. For these reasons, the number of shovel tests (>11-100 acres = 1 shovel test for every 2
acres) was reduced from the minimum standard of 42. Defined wetlands also minimized the shovel
testing. Shovel tests were dug to a maximum depth of one meter or to a depth where ground water
was encountered. Every effort was made to determine whether historic structures or prehistoric
cultural material was present on the island that is the project area. During the archaeological Phase
I survey, no artifacts indicating the existence of prehistoric or historic sites were collected and no
sites were found.

Geologic Setting
Falling in the Coastal Bend region of the West Gulf Coast Plain, the area has a dry, subhumid climate and receives an average annual rainfall of approximately 31 inches. Nueces County
occasionally experiences extremely high winds and torrential rains capable of removing topsoil as
well as some underlying soil layers. While much of the land is dedicated to agricultural and
livestock, petroleum and natural gas operations are also common in this area (Shafer 1968).

The soils on the flats of the Coastal Plains consist mainly of Orelia sandy clay loams,
Papalote fine sandy loam, Raymondville clay loam, and Monteola series (Figure 3).

Underlying

these soils is Pleistocene subsoil formed of Beaumont clay (Shafer 1968). However, because the
area on which the archaeological survey was conducted is made up of dredge material, or spoil,
from the construction of the ship channel, the aforementioned soils are not in natural formation on
the spoil island. Soils within the project area are heavily disturbed, thus they do not display natural
stratigraphy. The project area is vegetated with scrub and invasive plants likely deposited from
windblown events or carried in from fill stabilizing events. These include huisache (Acacia
farensia) and hackberry trees (Celtis occidentalis).

Background Information
The closest recorded archaeological sites that provided artifacts are located south of the
project area by approximately 1.57 kilometers, .97 kilometers, and 1.39 kilometers respectively.
All were recorded between 1977 and 1978 and are located south of the ship channel within Corpus
Christi proper.

While the description of the site was not provided, site 41NU158 was reported to have
shell, burned bone and clay, and scattered debitage suggesting it is a prehistoric site. Located in
the southeast corner of the Tule Lake Tract, S. Black recorded that the site was badly eroded in
1977. Site 41NU177 is also located in close proximity to Tule Lake Channel. The site produced
arrow points, dart points, pottery sherds, burned clay, clams, and oysters, and other snail shells. It
has been cut in half by railroad track and is currently part of an employee recreation center. Site
41NU177 lies about .64 k east of 41NU158. The third closest site to the current project area is
41NU176. Recorded by Malcom Johnson in 1978, this site is recorded simply as a shell midden
scattered over a fairly large area (Texas Historical Commission 2013).

The need for a deep water port in Corpus Christi was realized after the hurricane of 1919.
The Port was opened in 1926 with four cargo docks. In 1930, the channel was deepened to 30
feet, and by 1989 the current depth of 45 feet was reached. All of the dredging events added to
the island. It is possible that historic or prehistoric cultural material was dredged up and deposited
on the spoil island that now creates a barrier between Corpus Christi proper and Nueces Bay
(Wikipedia 2013).

There are numerous sites located along the south side of the ship channel however, there
are no recorded sites on the subject property, or within the entire spoil island. This land was
created as a result of dredge deposition during construction of the ship channel over a 60-year
period.

Dredging is an excavation activity or operation usually carried out at least partly

underwater, in shallow seas or fresh water areas with the purpose of gathering up bottom sediments
and disposing of them at a different location. This technique is often used to keep waterways
navigable. The process of dredging creates spoils (excess material), which are removed from the
6

dredged area. Dredging can produce materials for land reclamation or other purposes, usually
construction-related. Figures 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 show evidence of the construction of the island,
where the project tract is located, over time.

While idealized, the map from 1887 (see Figure 4) clearly shows open water north of the
shoreline. The area below the bluff and along Nueces Bay was void of any type of structure with
the exception of the railroad. By 1925, several structures dot the bluff line (see Figure 5). The
aerial from 1961 (see Figure 6) shows expansion of the spoil island from the time the Port opened
in 1926. Thus, the ship channel was constructed sometime between 1922 and 1926. It is clear that
the spoil was piped or pumped in as it appears in several maps to be fluvial-like, or fanned out.
By 1979 (see Figure 7), the island is somewhat vegetated and gravel/shell roads are visible. The
ship channel was dredged again to its current depth of 45 feet in 1989. The aerial from 1990 (see
Figure 8) suggests recent activity. Figure 9 is the most recent aerial available via Google Earth.
The current project area is clearly visible and looks virtually the same in 2011 as it does today.
Roads appear again along with some vegetation.

The maps and aerials from 1887 until 2011

provide evidence that the island has grown over time, and has not been used for homes, ranches,
or other types of structures. More importantly, the land was not present prehistorically.

Fieldwork and Results
In order to test the project area for historic or prehistoric cultural material, S. Morehead
and J. Pringle from CEI conducted a Phase I archaeological survey in Corpus Christi, Nueces
County, Texas on September 17 and 18, 2013. The archaeological project area measures 365.8
meters (1200 ft.) north to south and 975.4 m (3200 ft.) east to west. Twelve transects were created
to run north and south, and east to west throughout the project area. Transects were spaced every
30 meters, and shovel tests were excavated in any locations with less than 30 percent visibility in
order to maximize the possibility of locating any historic or prehistoric sites.

Originally,

preliminary research into the history and prehistory of the area along with the satellite imagery of
the project area led to an estimate of 42 shovel tests. However, once archaeologists arrived at the
site and began the survey, shovel testing was decreased in some areas due to inundation and
disturbance (Figure 10).

The field that is the project area was somewhat marshy due to recent rains (Figure 11).
Several wetlands dot the area as well. Other obstacles include roads, gravel and shell, standing
water, deep depressions and cut banks. As a note, the cut banks revealed more than 10 feet of
spoil (Figure 12 ). Most of the soils within the shovel tests suggest disturbed soils and fill. They
were consistently a 10 YR6/3 with spots or streaks of 10YR3/3 mottling (Figures 13 and 14). All
shovel tests were sandy with intermittent shell and gravel mixing. Small amounts of clay was seen
mixed with the sand in three shovel tests. Water was encountered in the majority of shovel tests
between 60 and 84 centimeters below the surface. All shovel tests were negative for cultural
material.

Surface scatters of shell were found across the project area however, none of the scatters
held artifacts or other evidence suggesting prehistoric occupation (Figure 15). The only object
encountered was a heavily rusted bar lying in the road that runs east to west on the south side of
the project area. The metal was surrounded by gravel and shell and determined to be modern trash
or an item that someone lost. This bar was not collected.

Conclusion
The entire project area was considered low probability for historic and prehistoric cultural
material. Indeed, reconnaissance and shovel tests support this. The entire plat of land that is the
subject property appears to be made up of spoils from the accumulation of the dredge while
constructing the ship channel. While survey revealed many areas to have deposits of oyster shell,
most of these deposits were crushed and found in association with gravel. This suggests that the
shell may have been deposited as stabilizer or fill for the land in general, or to create roadways.
Moreover, several gravel/shell roads are located within the area. The single object found, a rusty
bar of metal, is determined to be modern. No site, historic or prehistoric, was encountered during
reconnaissance or shovel testing survey. It is the determination of CEI archaeologists that the
construction of the condensate splitter be allowed to proceed.
