Abstract
On behalf of the Hidalgo County Regional Mobility Authority, Atkins North America, Inc. conducted
a series of intensive linear archeological surveys for proposed Sections A (now State Highway [SH]
365) and C of the Hidalgo Loop Project and the International Bridge Trade Corridor Project near
McAllen, in Hidalgo County, Texas. These projects were modified; however, after survey began with
regard to funding, extent, and name and Section C of the Hidalgo Loop Project was terminated prior
to completion of the survey.

Approximately 1,816 total acres of accessible properties were surveyed for the three projects under
Texas Antiquities Code Permits 5124, 5125, and 5683 between January 2009 and February 2014. A
total of 1,314 shovel tests and 97 trenches were excavated for the combined projects. Fourteen new
archeological sites were recorded, and seven previously recorded archeological sites were revisited
as a result of the surveys. Right of entry could not be obtained for one parcel within the SH 365 area
of potential effects (APE) at the time of survey but this parcel was eliminated from the APE due to
project design modifications in March 2014.

Sites 41HG223 and 41HG224 were recorded, and site 41HG230 was revisited within the proposed
Section A/SH 365 APE; sites 41HG224, 41HG230, and 41HG249–41HG255, as well as one isolated
find are located within the proposed SH 365 APE. One additional previously recorded archeological
site, 41HG142, was identified within the proposed Section A APE during the records review but was
not revisited during survey due to lack of right of entry. However, site 41HG142 is no longer within
the proposed Segment A/SH 365 APE. Previously recorded site 41HG30, plotted just outside the
Section A/SH 365 APE, was revisited, but no cultural materials associated with the site were found
to extend into the APE. Sites 41HG226, 41HG227, 41HG228, and 41HG229 were recorded, and sites
41HG146, 41HG147, 41HG201, 41HG203, and 41HG204 were revisited within the previously
proposed Section C APE. Three isolated finds and one possible cemetery (later determined to be a
memorial in August 2014) were also documented within the previously proposed Section C APE.
Site 41HG237 was recorded within the previously proposed International Bridge Trade Corridor
APE.

Based on the survey findings, Atkins recommends that sites 41HG223, 41HG224, 41HG226,
41HG227, 41HG229, 41HG230, and 41HG237 documented within the APEs of these projects are not
eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places under any criteria according to
36 CFR 60.4 and are not eligible for nomination as State Antiquities Landmarks according to 13
Texas Administrative Code (TAC) 26.12. Further, the eligibility of site 41HG228 for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places and nomination as a State Antiquities Landmark is unknown at
this time. Assessments of previously recorded sites 41HG146, 41HG147, 41HG201, 41HG203, and
41HG204 were not completed due to cancellation of the Section C Project. If the Section C Project is
revived in the future, Atkins recommends additional survey at these sites to complete the assess-

ments. For extant proposed projects SH 365 and International Bridge Trade Corridor, Atkins
further recommends a finding of no adverse effects for sites 41HG224, 41HG230, and 41HG237, and
therefore, construction should be allowed to proceed at these locations. However, sites 41HG249–
41HG255 are recommended eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places under
Criterion D and nomination as State Antiquities Landmarks. Atkins recommends these sites be
avoided by the proposed construction. Due to programmatic constraints and design requirements,
horizontal avoidance of the sites is not feasible. Therefore, Atkins proposes that the sites be avoided
by burial to consist of depositing at least 2 meters of in-kind fill dirt (i.e., clay over clay, clay over
loam, sand over sand) over the areas encompassed by site boundaries within the APE to depths to
be determined in consultation with the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) and Texas
Historical Commission (THC). If avoidance is not feasible, Atkins recommends that adverse effects
to the sites be mitigated through research-oriented data recovery excavations in advance of
construction. A mitigation plan for data recovery at the sites must be reviewed and approved by
TxDOT and the THC prior to fieldwork.

A few artifacts (lithic flakes, cut mussel shell, historic glass, cut nail) as well as samples of feature
fill, clay balls, mussel and snail shell, and faunal bone were collected from sites 41HG249–41HG254
during the site delineation phase work within the SH 365 APE; no other artifacts were collected
during the surveys. Artifacts not collected were described in sufficient detail, and a photographic
record was kept of all diagnostic artifacts during fieldwork. Collected items will be curated in
conjunction with pending mitigation phase work for sites 41HG249–41HG254 if our
recommendations of eligibility are concurred by the THC. If the sites are instead avoided, all
artifacts and special samples will be curated along with all notes, drawings, daily journals, site
record forms, photographs, and other documentation generated in association with the survey
phase at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at the Pickle Research Campus at The
University of Texas at Austin.

Management Summary
Atkins North America, Inc. has completed a series of intensive linear archeological surveys for
proposed Sections A (now State Highway 365) and C of the Hidalgo Loop Project and the
International Bridge Trade Corridor Project near McAllen, in Hidalgo County, Texas. The surveys
were sponsored by the Hidalgo County Regional Mobility Authority and performed in compliance
with the National Environmental Policy Act, the National Historic Preservation Act (Section 106),
and the Texas Antiquities Code. The goals of the investigations were to (1) locate all prehistoric and
historic archeological sites in the accessible portions of the area of potential effects (APE);
(2) determine the probability of archeological deposits in the inaccessible portions of the APE;
(3) establish vertical and horizontal site boundaries as appropriate with respect to the APE; and
(4) evaluate the significance and eligibility of recorded sites and structures for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places and/or designation as State Antiquities Landmarks. The
investigations were conducted by Project Archeologists Julie Shipp, Robert Rowe, Russ Shortes,
Collin Rucker, and Liz Sefton assisted by crew members Matt Basham, Dana Brown, Erin French,
Sarah Loftus, Katrina Miller, Angel Moody, Melanie Nichols, Dawn Riggs, Ryan Schuermann, Ray
Tubby, Walker Van Item, Erin Watkins, and Rae Wehr. Robert Rogers served as Principal
Investigator until his retirement, after which Andrea Burden assumed the role of Principal
Investigator. Dr. Charles Frederick acted as Geoarcheologist for the latter stages of the survey.
Approximately 1,816 total acres of accessible properties were surveyed for the three projects under
Texas Antiquities Code Permits 5124, 5125, and 5683 between January 2009 and February 2014. A
total of 1,314 shovel tests and 97 trenches were excavated for the combined projects. All of the
current State Highway 365 APE was surveyed.

Based on the survey findings, Atkins recommends that sites 41HG223, 41HG224, 41HG226,
41HG227, 41HG229, 41HG230, and 41HG237 documented within the APEs of these projects are not
eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places under any criteria and are not
eligible for nomination for State Antiquities Landmark status. Further, the eligibility of site
41HG228 for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places and nomination as a State
Antiquities Landmark is unknown at this time. In addition, previously recorded site 41HG30 plotted
just outside the Section A/State Highway 365 APE, was revisited, and no cultural materials
associated with the site were found to extend into the APE. Assessments of previously recorded
sites 41HG146, 41HG147, 41HG201, 41HG203, and 41HG204 were not completed due to
cancellation of the Section C Project. If the Section C Project is revived in the future, Atkins
recommends additional survey at these sites to complete the assessments. Also, within the previous
proposed Section C APE, one feature originally identified as a possible grave was determined to be a
memorial for an individual who died in a hunting accident. No further work is recommended for
this resource. For extant proposed projects State Highway 365 and International Bridge Trade

Management Summary
Corridor, Atkins further recommends a finding of no adverse effects for sites 41HG142, 41HG224,
41HG230, and 41HG237, and therefore, construction should be allowed to proceed at these
locations. However, sites 41HG249–41HG255 are recommended eligible for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places under Criterion D and nomination as State Antiquities
Landmarks. Atkins recommends these sites be avoided by the proposed construction. If avoidance
is not feasible, Atkins recommends that adverse effects to the sites be mitigated through researchoriented data recovery excavations in advance of construction. A mitigation plan for data recovery
at the sites must be reviewed and approved by the Texas Department of Transportation and Texas
Historical Commission prior to fieldwork.

I. INTRODUCTION
On behalf of the Hidalgo County Regional Mobility Authority (HCRMA), in cooperation with the
Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Pharr District, Atkins North America, Inc. (Atkins)
conducted a series of intensive linear archeological surveys for the proposed Sections A (portions of
which are now State Highway [SH] 365) and C of the Hidalgo Loop Project as well as the
International Bridge Trade Corridor (IBTC) Project south-southeast of McAllen in Hidalgo County,
Texas (Figure 1). The surveys were performed in compliance with the National Environmental
Policy Act, the National Historic Preservation Act (Section 106), and the Texas Antiquities Code
(TAC). As stipulated by the TAC, Texas Antiquities Permits were obtained for each of the three
projects in advance of survey (Figure 2). These projects were, however, modified subsequent to the
issuance of these permits with regard to funding, extent, and name, and in one case the project was
terminated prior to completion of the survey. The findings of each survey are nonetheless detailed
in this comprehensive report in accordance with conditions of the TAC Permits and consultation
with TxDOT Environmental Affairs Division (ENV, Chris Ringstaff) and the Texas Historical
Commission (THC, Mark Denton). Findings of the nonarcheological historic resources survey for SH
365 are detailed in a separate report (Harris and McWhorter 2013).

Each of the three projects (Section A [now SH 365], Section C, and the IBTC) entailed the proposed
construction of new tolled highways comprising up to six travel lanes. Originally, Section A of the
proposed Hidalgo Loop Project (Texas Antiquities Code [TAC] Permit 5124) would have extended
from existing U.S. Highway (US) 281 to existing US 83, north of and parallel to the Rio Grande, for
an approximate distance of 19 miles - requiring 915 acres of new right of way (ROW). Section A is
now defined as the SH 365 Project, which will extend from approximately 0.7 mile west of Farm-toMarket Road (FM) 1016/Conway Avenue east to US 281/Military Highway, a distance of 16.53
miles. The proposed SH 365 Project will require approximately 744 acres of new ROW.

Section C of the Hidalgo Loop Project (TAC Permit 5125) as originally proposed for construction
would extend from existing US 83 near La Joya to existing US 281 north of Edinburg, an
approximate distance of 31 miles. The project would have required 1,182 acres of new ROW but
was terminated during the planning stage after the cultural resources survey was partially
complete.

The original IBTC (TAC Permit 5683) would have extended from existing Spur (SP) 600 to US 83,
and from FM 493 to US 83, for an approximate distance of 16.39 miles. The project would have
required 618.2 acres of new ROW. A portion of the current SH 365 also would have overlapped the
western branch of the IBTC project area. The IBTC project has since been redesigned after
completion of the cultural resource survey and will require additional survey under a new TAC
permit. In advance of highway construction for the SH 365 Project, HCRMA also proposes to
demolish and relocate United States International Boundary and Water Commission (USIBWC)
levees at four locations along the SH 365 corridor that are located outside of the existing ROW.
Approximately 9,000 linear feet (ft) of USIBWC levees would be relocated.

State Highway 365 Project
The horizontal area of potential effects (APE) for each of the three projects corresponds or
corresponded with the proposed ROW, which will range from 160 to 300 ft wide, expanding to
400 ft wide at identified overpass locations. The ROW related to the levee relocations will also be
included in the archeological APE. The vertical APE will be a function of the profile and drainage
needs and will not be consistent throughout. In general, the vertical APE will be 39.5 inches
(1 meter [m]) for the mainlanes of the proposed roadway. Where overpasses will be constructed,
an additional 2 ft (60 centimeters [cm]) may be necessary for retaining walls or mechanically
stabilized earth. In areas where pilings are necessary, the vertical APE will be approximately 70 ft
(21.3 m). The vertical APE for all levee demolition and reconstruction is not anticipated to exceed
1 m below the current ground surface. It is also anticipated that all construction easements will be
within the proposed ROW.

The goals of the investigations were to (1) locate all prehistoric and historic archeological sites in
the accessible portions of the APE; (2) determine the probability of archeological deposits in the
inaccessible portions of the APE; (3) establish vertical and horizontal site boundaries as
appropriate with respect to the APE; and (4) evaluate the significance and eligibility of recorded
sites and structures for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and/or designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SAL). The archeological investigations consisted of a
background records review and an intensive archeological survey of the accessible portions of the
project areas in accordance with the THC and Council of Texas Archeologist (CTA) standards. The
background records review included archival research for archeological resources previously
identified within and in the vicinity of the project area. The intensive archeological survey consisted
of shovel testing and trenching and the examination of available surface and subsurface exposures
in determining the presence of archeological deposits.

At the time of survey, the projects were located on property owned and controlled by Hidalgo
County and on private property for which Hidalgo County had obtained right of entry (ROE).
Approximately 1,816 total acres of the roughly 3,473 total acres of the combined project APEs were
accessible and surveyed for archeological resources. Survey of the three projects took place
between January 15, 2009, and February 25, 2014. The investigations were conducted by Project
Archeologists Julie Shipp, Robert Rowe, Russ Shortes, Collin Rucker, and Liz Sefton assisted by crew
members Matt Basham, Dana Brown, Erin French, Sarah Loftus, Katrina Miller, Angel Moody,
Melanie Nichols, Dawn Riggs, Ryan Schuermann, Ray Tubby, Walker Van Item, Erin Watkins, and
Rae Wehr. Robert Rogers served as Principal Investigator until his retirement, after which Andrea
Burden assumed the role of Principal Investigator. Dr. Charles Frederick acted as Project
Geoarcheologist for the latter stages of the survey.

II. PROJECT HISTORIES
As each of these projects has undergone modifications that ultimately affected which portions of
the APEs were surveyed for archeological resources, the results of which are the subject of this
report, brief overviews of project developments are presented below as background for the reader.
The reader is also referred to Figure 2 in conjunction with this text.

HIDALGO LOOP PROJECT

In 2008, HCRMA initiated environmental assessment work on what was then known as the Hidalgo
Loop Project, which was composed of Sections A, B, C, and D. Originally, the project was set to
receive federal funding from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), and TxDOT ENV became
the designated regulatory review authority. Atkins applied for and was granted two TAC permits
for Sections A and C (Permits 5124 and 5125). Based on the ROE obtained, portions of both
Sections A and C were surveyed in 2009. In 2010, HCRMA reevaluated the feasibility of the various
elements/ sections of the Hidalgo Loop Project and determined the concept was not feasible as
originally envisioned. Due to HCRMA’s continuing transportation needs, the Hidalgo Loop was
redesigned/ scaled back, and a portion of the project was slated to receive alternate funding. As a
result, advancing a transportation project in Section C was abandoned.

SH 365 AND IBTC

The Section A ROW was reduced and subsequently redefined as SH 365. In addition, ROW
previously located within Sections A and B was redefined as IBTC and set to receive local instead of
federal funding. This change in funding strategy resulted in TxDOT ENV no longer being included in
the process as the regulatory review authority. Since SH 365 is located within the Section A ROW,
portions of SH 365 were surveyed in 2009 under TAC Permit 5124. However, areas where ROE had
not yet been granted and a few small sections of added ROW were not surveyed. The southwestern
portion of the IBTC (between US 281 and Dicker Road) had also been surveyed in 2009 as Section A
under TAC Permit 5124. In order to complete the survey of the IBTC ROW with the change in
funding, Atkins applied for a third TAC permit (Permit 5683), and the remainder of the original
IBTC ROW was surveyed under this permit in 2010. A draft report of the IBTC survey findings was
submitted directly to the THC for review in September 2010. THC’s concurrence on the report was
received in April 2011. Then, in January 2014, the IBTC project was redesigned, resulting in a
partial abandonment of the previously proposed ROW and addition of approximately 7.5 miles of
new ROW that will be surveyed under a new TAC permit. The current TAC Permit 5683 will be
completed with the submission of the final report on the 2009 and 2010 survey work and curation.
The effect on contributing elements to the NRHP-listed Louisiana-Rio Grande Canal Company
Irrigation System will still be evaluated for the new design plans under the new TAC permit.

US 281/IBTC OVERPASS
Late in 2010, HCRMA modified the southwestern limits of the IBTC Project. A new federally funded
project was redefined as US 281/IBTC Overpass. This segment had previously been included in
Section A and surveyed under TAC Permit 5124 in 2009. Although survey findings for the
US 281/IBTC Overpass were presented in the IBTC draft report (TAC Permit 5683) and reviewed
by the THC in October 2010, these findings were removed prior to submittal of the revised draft
IBTC report (see Appendix A) to the THC in November 2010 as a result of the change in the IBTC
project limits. This revised draft report was accepted by the THC in April 2011. As a result, findings
for the US 281/IBTC Overpass that do not appear in the final IBTC report are summarized in this
report.

III. NATURAL SETTING
This section provides an overview of the physical setting of the region relevant to the current
investigations including the natural setting, geology, soils, flora, and fauna.

NATURAL SETTING

Several sources can be cited for describing the natural setting of any area of Texas. Some of the
most popular descriptors for natural settings are biotic provinces, ecological regions, and
ecoregions. These areas can be further subdivided depending on the source of reference. For
instance, the project areas lie within (a) the Matamoran District of the Tamaulipan Biotic Province
(Blair 1950), (b) the South Texas Plains Ecological Region (Blair 1950; Gould 1969), and (c) the
Lower Rio Grande Alluvial Floodplain portion of the Western Gulf Coast Plain ecoregion (Griffith
et al. 2004). Biotic province refers to an area with a similar community of floral and faunal associations based on physiographic characteristics and soil type, as well as climate (Presley 2003).
Ecological regions are largely based on an attempt to standardize the taxonomic accounts of
vascular plants in Texas, which rely heavily on vegetation types and dominant plant species, as well
as soils and current land uses (Gould 1969; Hatch et al. 1990). Finally, ecoregions refer to areas of
similar biotic and abiotic phenomena such as geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land
use, wildlife, and hydrology (Griffith et al. 2004). Due to the ecoregion definition providing a more
concise depiction of the natural setting of the project areas, the Griffith et al. (2004) description of
the Lower Rio Grande Alluvial Floodplain portion of the Western Gulf Coast Plain ecoregions is used
for this report.
The Western Gulf Coast Plain maintains a relatively flat topography with predominantly grassland
vegetation adjacent to the coast. Moving inland, the region’s plains are older, more irregular, and
have mostly forest or savanna-type vegetation. The Lower Rio Grande Alluvial Floodplain portion of
the ecoregion predominantly consists of Holocene-aged alluvial sands and clays of the Rio Grande.
Historically, the floodplain ridges once had abundant palm trees, and early Spanish explorers called
the river “Rio de las Palmas” (Griffith et al. 2004). However, most large palm trees and floodplain
forests had been cleared by the early 1900s. Currently, the region is dominated by cropland with
rice, grain sorghum, cotton, and soybeans as the principal crops. In addition, urban and industrial
land uses have expanded greatly in recent decades, and oil and gas production is common. Channels
for irrigation and urban use have mostly diverted the waters of the Rio Grande with little or no flow
reaching the Gulf of Mexico.

Elevations throughout the region range from sea level to approximately 100 ft (30 m) above mean
sea level. Average annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 35 inches (40 to 89 cm), occurring mostly
in the spring and fall. Summers are often characterized by drought conditions that are frequently of
sufficient duration to depress crop growth.

GEOLOGY
The current Lower Rio Grande Valley is a mix of riverbank, shore, marsh, and lake settings with the
amalgamation of silty and sandy flat floodplain giving rise to shifting stream channels. This system
of altered steam channels results in the resacas and oxbows and meander scars that are found
throughout the region. These structures are perpetually affected by wind-borne sediments (Butzer
1982).

Since the last glacial maximum (ca. 20,000 B.P.), the river valley has changed dramatically. Ocean
levels had risen approximately 100 m causing the course of the Rio Grande to shorten with the
influx of the rising sea water, which caused an increase in valley aggregation (Brown et al. 1980).
After the last glacial maximum by the middle of the Holocene, the Rio Grande was depositing
alluvial soils and ultimately flooding the valley several times (Boyd et al. 1994). These flooding
episodes created an estuarine environment (Brown et al. 1980). The filling of the valley ceased
between 10,000 and 7000 B.P., resulting in additional soil aggregation manifested as prograding
delta lobes over earlier Holocene deposits. Sea level reached its present level at around 3000 B.P.,
and due to the rising water, the lobes were reworked, eroded away, and redeposited.
The geology of the Lower Rio Grande Valley consists of Holocene (>10,000 years), Pleistocene
(10,000–2 million years [my]), and Pliocene (12.5–4.5 my) fluvial and deltaic deposits (Brown et al.
1980). Multiple high, level Pleistocene terraces border the Holocene floodplain and delta complex.
These terraces were formed by fluvial-deltaic deposition during maximum sea level periods and
under glacial minimum conditions during the middle to late Pleistocene (Paine 2000). Overlying the
terraces are extensive windblown deposits of sand and clay dunes, interspersed with sand sheets
and localized wind deflation areas. Holocene stabilized sand dunes occur as broad, segmented
expanses of northwestward-trending eolian deposits (Mallouf et al. 1977:9–10). These deposits
usually have a height of 1 to 9 m. The surface relief of the stabilized sand dunes is typically
undulating with occasional eolian depressions of varying size and shape (Mallouf et al. 1977:9–10).
Because of the active nature of these windblown deposits, archeological sites may be repeatedly
buried and eroded. In addition, the depressions that can occur in them possess the capability of
retaining water for a limited time after rains and, given the importance of water in the arid
landscape, would have been attractive to prehistoric animals and people.
The oldest bedrock deposit within the project areas is the Pliocene epoch Goliad Formation (12.5–
4.5 my). It is exposed in central and southwestern Hidalgo County and manifested as fluvial
deposits composed of clay, sand, sandstone, caliche, chert, limestone, and dark siliceous granules
and pebbles in a caliche matrix (Brown et al. 1980). This formation is the source of much of the
locally obtained raw materials used for prehistoric stone tools within the region (Bousman et al.
1990).

Atkins 100020726/140023

III. Natural Setting
The Lissie Formation overlays the eastern edge of the Goliad Formation as an unconformity in
central Hidalgo County. The formation was deposited during the Oligocene into the middle
Pleistocene and ended at 14,000 B.P. and included at least 14 continental glacial advances interspersed by warmer periods (Day et al. 1981). The Lissie Formation consists of gray to brown to
pale yellow clay, silt, sand, siliceous gravel, and sandy caliche. Pockets of stabilized sand dune
deposits characterized by dense live oak copses and scrub vegetation occur within the formation
(Brown et al. 1980).
Within southern Hidalgo County is the Beaumont Formation of the Late Pleistocene, which is
exposed as matrices of clay, silt, sand, and gravel to a depth to 270 m. The sediments composing the
Beaumont Formation were primarily deposited by rivers and include natural levees and deltas that
coalesced through shifting of the river mouths as they reached the coast. The marine element of the
formation is much less pronounced and includes marine and lagoonal waters in the embayments
between the stream ridges and delta plains (Sellards et al. 1966). Archeologically, the age of these
deposits precludes the presence of deeply buried sites, but may contain megafaunal remains.

There are currently three major physical divisions of the project areas: meanderbelt deposits, flood
basin deposits, and terrace deposits. Within the active and Holocene floodplains are the
meanderbelt deposits and flood basin deposits, which are bordered by the terrace deposits of the
old Rio Grande system. The meanderbelt deposits contain primarily point bar deposits formed by
active river migration. These deposits are typically composed of coarse-grained materials and
include channel-type depositional environments (i.e., abandoned channels, courses, crevasse
channels, and other minor short-lived river channels).

Adjacent to the active meanderbelt deposits are the flood basin deposits. As the name implies, finegrained sediments are transported and deposited to the lowest and distal positions of the
floodplain during high-water events to form these deposits. Flood basin deposits are composed
primarily of clay, and they are generally represented by the Hidalgo and Harlingen soil series from
the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) soil maps. These soils were also used to construct large
portions of the levees in the area and are exposed in the smaller unlined ditches and drains. They
also make up most of the agricultural soils within the project areas. Also present in the flood basin
deposits are abandoned Holocene Rio Grande meanderbelts and the La Cruz Resaca.

The late Pleistocene terrace deposits border the active floodplain along the northern edge of the
Section A/SH 365 APE and are built on early to middle Pleistocene terraces and associated soils.
The terraces contain the same suite of deposited environments that is present on the modern and
Holocene floodplains. Terrace deposits contain older channels and courses of the Rio Grande, which
flowed at a higher elevation than in the present-day system. Holocene and Pleistocene windblown
deposits veneer the terrace surfaces, making interpretation of the abandoned channels and courses
of the older system difficult in photography and imagery. Additional, significant urban development

Atkins 100020726/140023

11

State Highway 365 Project
and large-scale agricultural activities in the Lower Rio Grande Valley have altered much of the
original fabric of the floodplain.

Currently the area is in a destructional phase. Sea level rise, negligible river flow by the Rio Grande
to the Gulf of Mexico because of increased irrigation, construction of major main-stem dams, and
corresponding lack of river-transported sediment, as well as frequent storm surges have produced
an erosional shoreline in the Lower Rio Grande Valley.

SOILS

It is important to understand the sedimentation and the soil-development sequence in the
interpretation of site-formation processes. Soil formation on alluvial terraces is usually quite
different from that on floodplains. The number of soils in a stratigraphic sequence and their degree
of development can be important in assessing the duration and integrity of the archeological record
at an alluvial site.

Soil scientists have developed an extensive nomenclature of soil types. Identification of the current
soils and reconstruction of past soils within the project areas are essential for grasping the nature
and extent of early activities and inferring past environmental and climatic conditions. The soils of
four soil series have been mapped along the three project areas from USDA soil maps of the area.
These soils can be grouped into three soil orders: Vertisols, Mollisols, and Inceptisols. General soil
associations for these areas consist of McAllen-Brennan and Brennan-Hidalgo (nearly level to
gently sloping loamy soils on uplands), Delfina-Hebbronville-Comitas (nearly level to gently sloping
sandy soils on uplands), Harlingen-Runn-Reynosa (nearly level, clayey and loamy soils on terraces),
and Rio Grande-Matamoros (nearly level, loamy and clayey soils on bottom lands).

Vertisols usually consist of dark clay soils or soils with high clay content. Vertisols shrink and swell,
often in accordance with seasonal variations in moisture. The clay consists primarily of expansive
clays, such as montmorillonite, that form deep, wide desiccation cracks during the drier seasons,
which produces a hummock-and-swale topography with a subsurface expression of mixed soils.
Alternating shrinking and swelling results in mixing and creates a thick A horizon (Rapp and Hill
1998). Soils of the Harlingen and Benito series are Vertisols found in the project areas (Jacobs
1981). Harlingen soils are very deep, moderately well-drained, and very slowly permeable soils that
formed in clayey sediments. They occur on nearly level stream terraces. In a typical soil profile, they
have a horizon sequence consisting of Ap-A-Bss-Bss1-Bss2. Benito soils are deep, poorly drained,
and very slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous alluvial sediments. They occur on nearly
level terraces and have a typical horizon sequence of Az-ACnz-2CKnz.
Mollisols are soils that formed under grasslands vegetation. They are typically dark in color as a
result of the accumulation of organic matter. They are also base-rich and usually have a mollicepipedon, which is a soil surface horizon characterized by a dark color, fine structure, a minimum of
1 percent organics, and a base saturation of over 50 percent (Buol et al. 1989). They form under a
Atkins 100020726/140023

12

III. Natural Setting
wide variety of parent rocks, in the case of the local Mollisols the parent rocks are clays. Earthworm
activity is often extensive in Mollisols, and the consequent mixing affects archeological sites by
altering artifactual spatial patterns (Rapp and Hill 1998). This soil is often heavily modified due to
plowing activities associated with agriculture. Mollisols that appear within the project areas are of
the Hidalgo series (Jacobs 1981). Hidalgo soils are deep, well-drained, moderately permeable soils
that formed in calcareous loamy sediments. They occur on gently sloping uplands and have a typical
soil horizon sequence of Ap-A-B2-B2ca-Cca.
The principal concept behind Inceptisols is that they are immature soils of humid regions that have
profile features that are more weakly developed than mature soils and retain close resemblances to
the parent material (Buol et al. 1989). These soils have an A horizon with an underlying, weakly
developed B horizon. The B horizon had little remnant structure and tends to be redder in color
because of the accumulation or leaching of minerals (Rapp and Hill 1998). In Hidalgo County, the
soil order is represented by the Runn series (Jacobs 1981). Runn soils are deep, moderately welldrained, and slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey sediments. They are found on nearly
level stream terraces. In a typical profile, Runn soils have a horizon sequence of Ap-A-Bk-BCk-2BCk.

INTEGRITY OF BURIED ARCHEOLOGICAL DEPOSITS

Certain elements of the soils, topography, and geology of the project APEs described above will
affect the likelihood of encountering intact, buried archeological deposits within the APE during
survey. As the collective APE of these projects is located within floodplain and terrace deposits
adjacent to the Rio Grande, there is high potential for encountering intact, buried prehistoric
archeological deposits as these landforms have experienced alluvial and eolian aggradation for a
significant period of time. However, due to substantial modern agricultural activity in much of this
area, both prehistoric and historic deposits within range of the plow zone (roughly 30–60 cm below
ground surface) may lack integrity but those below may retain integrity.

FLORA

The unique ecology of the Lower Rio Grande Valley is characterized by a combination of climate,
vegetation, and wildlife associations unlike anywhere else in the U.S. (Jahrsdoerfer and Leslie
1988). Historically, the flora of the region was described as being “. . . composed of riparian lands
and bottomlands deciduous forests” (Kibler and Freeman 1993:3). However, agricultural activities
in the Rio Grande Delta region since the early part of the twentieth century have created a
vegetation community vastly different from its indigenous species (Jahrsdoerfer and Leslie 1988).
These recent edaphic factors and human activities have resulted in a shrubland climax of mixedbrush and acacia associations that dominate the uncultivated vegetation community of the region.
Mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) and acacia (Acacia sp.) are the dominant species in this community
with other scrub and brush species throughout the area that include prickly pear (Opuntia
lindheimeri), Barbados cherry or Mexican myrtle (Malpighia glabra), and saw greenbrier (Smilax

13

State Highway 365 Project
bonanox). Although the project areas cross isolated pockets of uncultivated vegetation, the majority
of the APE lies within agricultural fields, consisting mainly of cotton, grain sorghum, sugarcane, and
citrus, and residential developments with manicured lawns.

FAUNA

The fauna of the of the region includes numerous neotropical species, numerous grassland species
that also range north of the province, some Austroriparian species from the east, and a small
number of Chihuahuan species from the west (Blair 1950, 1952). Some common small mammals
that may occur in the project areas include the pocket mouse (Perognathus hispidus), white-footed
mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), southern plains woodrat (Neotoma micropus), desert cottontail
(Sylvilagus audubonii), and black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus) (Davis and Schmidly 1994).
Large mammal species that have potential to occur within the project areas include white-tailed
deer (Odocoileus virginianus), coyote (Canis latrans), bobcat (Lynx rufus), and javelina (Tayassu
tajacu) (Davis and Schmidly 1994). The area supports an abundant and diverse avifauna on a
seasonal basis. Some common resident species include the mourning dove (Zenaida macroura),
northern mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos), house sparrow (Passer domesticus), olive sparrow
(Arremonops rufi virgatus), the northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), red-tailed hawk (Buteo
jamaicensis), and long-billed thrasher (Toxostoma longirostre) (Davis and Schmidly 1994).
Numerous neotropical invertebrates and vertebrates are limited in their U.S. distribution to the
region, and many are found within the U.S. only in the Lower Rio Grande Valley.

IV. CULTURAL SETTING
This section provides an overview of the cultural setting relevant to the current investigations by
providing a chronological summary of human occupation in the region. The archeological regions of
Texas, as recognized by Perttula (2004), are typically broadly defined by the general physiographic
zones of Texas. In this regard, Hidalgo County is located within the South Texas archeological
region, which is also referred to as the Rio Grande Plain, the Nueces Plain, or the South Texas Plain
(Hester 2004a). The South Texas archeological region is defined as being located between the
Balcones Escarpment to the north and the mouth of the Rio Grande to the south, and between the
Rio Grande to the west to an area approximately 60–65 kilometers (km) inland from the coast to
the east (Figure 3; Hester 2004a). In this regard, the project areas lie along the southern extreme of
the region approximately 100 km inland from the coast.

Figure 3.Texas Archeological Regions (Perttula 2004): (1) Red River; (2) Northeast Texas;
(3) Deep East Texas; (4) Savanna and Prairie; (5) Southeast Texas; (6) Coastal Texas;

(11) Caprock Canyonlands; (12) Southern High Plains; (13) Panhandle; (14) Lower Pecos;
(15) Trans-Pecos; and (16) El Paso/Hueco Bolson
Although studies have been conducted in the region for years, the overall prehistory of the region
remains poorly understood. Phases and complexes, tool assemblages, and cultural chronologies are
not well defined. The picture is further complicated by the extensive modifications that have been
made to the land as a result of modern agricultural and ranching practices. Archeological

investigations in the region have been limited to surface collections by professional and avocational
archeologists, and a few relatively minor NRHP testing efforts. The following sequence draws
heavily on the chronology outlined by Hester (2004a) with his summary of the prehistory of South
Texas, and further augmented by Terneny (2005) with her reevaluation of the Late Prehistoric and
Archaic periods in the Rio Grande Delta of South Texas. Sites mentioned in the discussion are
illustrated in Figure 4.

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (11,500 TO 8000 B.P.)

The Paleoindian period in South Texas is recognized by the presence of projectile points such as
Clovis, Folsom, Plainview, Golondrina, Scottsbluff, and Angostura. These points coupled with spears
aided in the pursuit of large game animals. Although intact deposits containing evidence of
Paleoindian occupations are unknown in South Texas, evidence from sites in adjacent regions
suggests the period was characterized by low population density, small bands, and large territorial
ranges of nomadic groups that subsisted by hunting Late Pleistocene megafauna. During this
period, great expanses of land were inundated by the rising sea levels. Temperatures may have
been 10–15.4 degrees Fahrenheit cooler than today (Bousman et al. 1990:94).

The scant evidence of Paleoindian occupations in the South Texas region includes Clovis points
found at sites in Wilson, Dimmit, and Atascosa Counties as well as at the Southern Island site on the
Mexican side of the Rio Grande at Falcon Reservoir (Hester 2004a). Folsom artifacts have been
found on the Rio Grande Plain, such as preforms and failures in Webb County and near Falcon
reservoir; and isolated finds such as a Folsom projectile point base recovered from 41CF54 near
Laguna Atascosa in Cameron County (Terneny 2005). However, no Folsom camp or kill sites have
been found in the region (Hester 2004a). Later Paleoindian projectile points have been recovered
mostly from the northern extent of the region, such as Golondrina, Plainview, Angostura, and
Scottsbluff types from Uvalde, Bexar, Victoria, and Williamson Counties (Terneny 2005). Noted
Paleoindian sites in the South Texas Archeological Region include Berger Bluff (41GD30) in Goliad
County, 41WY140 in Willacy County, and the Johnston-Heller (41VT15), J2 Ranch (41VT6), and
Willeke (41VT16) sites in Victoria County.

ARCHAIC PERIOD (8000–1200 B.P.)

The Archaic period witnessed a shift to an exploitation of a wider range of plant and animal species,
coupled with a decrease in mobility that was probably associated with climate change. Perennial
steams existed in some areas of the local draws, but extensive freshwater ponds producing
diatomaceous muds also began to appear where discharge declined. Water in the lakes and ponds
fluctuated, sometimes completely drying up. By the end of the period, many of the streams ceased
to flow and the diatomite lakes evolved into muddy marshes. The transition from flowing water to
standing water represents a dramatic hydrologic change in the area. The widespread decrease in

water was the result of decrease in regional effective precipitation from the late Pleistocene to the
early Holocene. This decrease affected both runoff and spring discharge. Paleontological data
(Graham 1987; Johnson 1986) document this environmental change as well as sedimentologic and
stratigraphic information (Holliday 1995), which caused streams that formerly flowed year-round
to dry up.

Such a drastic, though perhaps gradual, loss of primary food sources exploited in the Paleoindian
period would have caused considerable cultural stress. It was probably this stress that caused a
shift of attention to previously unexploited plants and animals. Throughout the Americas, the
Archaic was a time of increasing technological (and probably social) complexity. Toolkits become
larger, and through time the many regional differences slowly coalesced into more-homogenous
forms. This includes an emphasis on the exploitation of marine resources in coastal zones (Terneny
2005). The period is often divided into the Early, Middle, and Late periods with additional divisions
such as complexes and horizons attributed to the Archaic throughout the region. These include the
Repelo (4000–2000 B.P.) and Abasolo (4000–2000 B.P.) complexes identified by MacNeish (1947)
and the early corner-notched horizon (circa 8000–5500 B.P.) and the early basal-notched horizon
(circa 5600–4500 B.P.) outlined by Hester (2004a). However, overall the period is also poorly
understood in the Lower Rio Grande Valley, and sites dating to this time, especially Early and
Middle Archaic sites, are rarely encountered and are limited to surface finds. Late Archaic sites are
more common, but are often mixed with Late Prehistoric-aged deposits (Kibler and Freeman 1993).

Early Archaic (6000–2500 B.C.)

Like the Paleoindian period, sites associated with the Early Archaic are rare in South Texas, and
areas such as the Rio Grande Delta and Sand Sheet have no representative sites for this time
(Terneny 2005). Hester’s distinction between the early corner-notched and the early basal-notched
horizons is primarily derived from data generated from Central Texas and the Lower Pecos areas
with stronger cultural chronologies (Hester 2004a). Representative artifacts associated with the
early corner-notched horizon include early expanding-stem (Bandy, Martindale, and Uvalde) dart
points and the Guadalupe distally beveled tool (Terneny 2005). The subsequent early basalnotched horizon includes Bell and Andice points, early triangular bifaces, and Clear Fork tools
(Hester 2004a; Terneny 2005). The Mackenzie site (41VT17) in Victoria County produced Bell
points and radiocarbon assays indicating an Early Archaic occupation and thus became the oldest
shell midden in South Texas (Ricklis 1986).

Middle Archaic (2500–400 B.C.)

The Middle Archaic is identified by an easily recognized change in material culture patterns. This
includes assemblages in South Texas consisting of triangular dart point forms, known as Tortugas,
Abasolo, and Carrizo. In addition, smaller unifacially distally beveled tools and stemmed projectile
points have been recovered in the northern part of South Texas. These points include Pedernales,
Atkins 100020726/140023

IV. Cultural Setting
Lange, Langtry, and Morhiss (Hester 2004a). Information on settlement patterns during this period
is sparse. However, substantial data from Choke Canyon and Chaparrosa indicate that open
campsites were located along former stream channels early in the period before relocating to
floodplains, low terraces, and natural levees later in the period (Hester 2004a). Survey work in
Willacy and Hidalgo Counties has yielded dart points that may be Archaic (Mallouf et al. 1977).
However, work at Falcon Reservoir showed that some of these types continue into the Late
Prehistoric period (Suhm and Jelks 1962). Investigations at the cemetery site Loma Sandia
(41LK28) in Live Oak County yielded detailed information on Middle Archaic burial practices
derived from 205 burials, which included interments with dart points, stone pipes, shell ornaments,
and deer antlers (Taylor and Highley 1995).

Late Archaic (400 B.C.–A.D. 800)

Dart points associated with the Late Archaic are small, with corner or side notches. Examples
include Shumla, Ensor, Frio, Marcos, Montell, Fairland, and Ellis. Tools diagnostic of this period in
South Texas include Olmos bifaces, Nueces scrapers, and corner tang bifaces (Black 1989:51).
Examples of Late Archaic sites include Choke Canyon (41LK201), the Johnson site, the Kent-Crane
site (41AS3), and a site at Ingleside Cove. At Choke Canyon, hearths, earth ovens, and manos and
metates have been found, which illustrate exploitation of plant resources. Also recorded at the site
were faunal remains of deer, rabbit, turtles, fish, and other species, as well as evidence that peoples
were exploiting Rabdotus snails and mussel species (Hall et al. 1987). Additional data from Choke
Canyon illustrate that favored locales for open campsites are on stream channels and their adjacent
sloughs.

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CIRCA A.D. 800–1600)

The Late Prehistoric occupation of the area by hunter-gatherer inhabitants has been often referred
to as the “Brownsville Complex.” This complex has been defined on basic analysis and characteristics observed from small surface collections, salvage excavations, and a small number of cultural
resource surveys. However, Terneny (2005:225) argues that the “. . . [Brownsville Complex] artifact
sets thought to be present only in the Late Prehistoric burial situations, were present in the Archaic
as well.” She goes on to say: “As such, the ‘Brownsville Complex’ must be redefined in terms of its
presence in the Archaic and Late Prehistoric; cemeteries and burials that contain ‘Brownsville
Complex’ artifacts cannot automatically be assumed to belong to the Late Prehistoric” (Terneny
2005:225).

Therefore, this Late Prehistoric section provides a summary of the Late Prehistoric period of South
Texas by Hester (2004a) and a summary of the Brownsville Complex. However, the Brownsville
Complex summary should be understood as needing further research to determine a more precise
temporal affiliation (see Terneny 2005 for a more-in-depth discussion). Although a hunting and
gathering lifeway continues in the Late Prehistoric as in the Archaic, the material culture, hunting
Atkins 100020726/140023

State Highway 365 Project
patterns, settlement types, and other facets of the era mark a fairly distinctive break with the past
(Hester and Turner 2010). In this time period, the bow and arrow and pottery are introduced, along
with other distinctive types of stone tools (Hester and Turner 2010). As with any time period
distinction, there is limited evidence to suggest that a new phase of cultural history was launched
by the immigration of new peoples into the region as opposed to cultural diffusion or by the coming
of a radically new mode of subsistence such as agriculture. The mode of organization of the Late
Prehistoric people appears to mirror the full expression of traits already in existence. Therefore, it
appears the Late Prehistoric societies took certain practices begun in the Archaic period and
refined them to various degrees, which ultimately transformed the whole way of life.
The Late Prehistoric in southern Texas shares cultural patterns with Central Texas (Hester 2004a).
This includes transitional Archaic “dart points” such as Ensor and Matamoros, and Late Prehistoric
Scallorn arrow points found at Blue Bayou (41VT94) in Victoria County and a burial site in Frio
County. The main marker for the Late Prehistoric in the region is the occurrence of the Toyah
horizon. 1 Artifacts associated with the Toyah horizon include the Perdiz arrow point, small end
scrapers, flake knives, beveled knives, bone-tempered pottery, perforators, shell ornaments, and
assorted ornamental beads and objects (Hester 2004a). These have been found at sites in Jim Wells
County (41JW8) and Live Oak County (41LK201), and at other sites closer to central Texas.
Although sites closer to the project areas in Zapata and Webb Counties often yield Perdiz points and
some combination of Toyah-trait artifacts, the whole assemblage is not present, with bison often
absent (Hester 2004a).
The bulk of our knowledge of the archeology of the Late Prehistoric in South Texas is from
MacNeish’s (1958) definition of two closely related complexes, the Brownsville and Barril, for the
Lower Rio Grande area. This cultural complex has been defined on basic analysis and
characteristics observed from small surface collections, salvage excavations, and a small number of
cultural resource surveys. Common to both complexes are shell disks, pierced shell disk beads,
plugs made from a columella that are round in cross section, rectangular conch shell pendants,
mollusc shell scrapers, and Starr, Fresno, and Matamoros projectile points. Intrusive artifacts
include pottery of Huastec origin from southern Tamaulipas, which appears in occupation sites and
in burials (Anderson 1932; MacNeish 1947; Mason 1935), as well as obsidian and jadeite used in
pendants. Burials of individuals are tightly flexed and located away from living areas.

The largest known Brownsville/Barril site near the project areas is located approximately 4 km
north of the center of the Section A/SH 365 APE and is known as the Ayala site (41HG1); the site is
located on a bluff of a resaca and consisted of at least 45 flexed burials with associated burial
materials. The site has been heavily looted, but it has also been subjected to an archeological
excavation (Campbell and Frizzell 1949; Hester and Ruecking 1969).

IV. Cultural Setting

PROTOHISTORIC PERIOD (CIRCA A.D. 1600–1800)
The Protohistoric period is described as the transition period between the prehistoric and historic
periods. The beginning of the period is attributed to the arrival in the early 1600s of Europeans
(Spanish) to South Texas (Hester 2004a). Indian sites from the final period are distinguished by the
presence of European and nonaboriginal American trade goods that date from the sixteenth
through mid-eighteenth centuries. Debris on Protohistoric sites indicates a continuation of the
nomadic hunting and gathering existence that was begun during the Archaic period. The best
account of the native peoples of Texas comes from the chronicle of Àlvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, a
survivor of a Spanish shipwreck in 1528 (Covey 1972). These first Spaniards encountered as many
as 50 different groups living in the immediate area. Many of these indigenous people were
identified as speaking the Coahuiltecan language of southern Texas and northeastern Mexico
(Salinas 1990).

The Coahuiltecan language is similar to the Karankawan, which was spoken by coastal peoples
north of Corpus Christi up to the west side of Galveston Bay (Swanton 1940). From Corpus Christi,
the Coahuiltecan area extended northwestward to San Antonio, westward to just below the
confluence of the Pecos River and Rio Grande, and southward into Nuevo Leon, northeast of
Coahuila, northern San Luis Potosi, northeastern Zacatecas, and northern Tamaulipas. Coahuiltecan
peoples were originally considered to be linguistically related to the Hokan groups of languages in
California (Ruecking 1955; Sapir 1920; Swanton 1940). The theory of linking the prehistoric
languages of Texas and California was known as the “Hokan Hypotheses” (Lyle 1997). Current
studies suggest that Coahuiltecan was an isolated language (Lyle 1997).

Research has indicated that the Coahuiltecans probably never existed as a single tribe. Rather,
groups with similar language were identified by the Spanish as Coahuilteco, presumably because
the native homeland of many groups was Coahuila, Mexico. By the 1850s, a combination of
European-introduced diseases and tribal wars stimulated by Europeans had decimated the Indians
of South Texas (Campbell 1958). There is no extant Coahuiltecan tribe today; however, there is a
group based in the San Antonio area that calls itself the Tap Pilam—the Coahuiltecan Nation. They
are not a federally recognized tribe at this time, but the tribe has filed a petition for recognition by
the Secretary of the Interior that the group exists as an Indian tribe (Federal Register 1998).

There are no indigenous tribes extant in the area. Modern tribes that in the past have been active in
this part of Texas include the Comanche, Kiowa, and Lipan Apache. The Comanche and Kiowa, who
both were mobile Southern Plains tribes, came into South Texas following herds of wild mustangs
and bison as well as to raid Mexican towns near the present-day international border. The
traditional homeland of the Lipan Apache included the area between the Texas Panhandle and the
Hill Country of Central Texas; however, they conducted incursions into South Texas.

HISTORIC PERIOD IN SOUTHERN HIDALGO COUNTY
Spain was the first European nation to lay claim to present-day Hidalgo County, and the Spanish
were also the first to make contact with the Native American groups living in the region. As
previously stated, Spanish exploration in the Rio Grande Valley may have occurred as early as 1528
when Àlvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca reportedly traveled through the area following his shipwreck in
the Gulf of Mexico (Garza 2008a). However, the theory that he traveled through what became
Hidalgo County remains unsubstantiated. After a series of attempts to settle other areas in the
Lower Rio Grande Valley by Gonzalo de Ocampo (1523), Sancho de Canielo (1528), and Pedro de
Alvarado (1535) proved unsuccessful, Spanish activity in the area centered on maintaining their
sovereignty over the region rather than encouraging colonization. As a result, subsequent
exploration of what became Hidalgo County was only initiated in response to feared encroachment
by other European nations (Dixon et al. 2003).
For example, in 1638, Jacinto García de Sepulveda crossed the Rio Grande from Mexico (then
Spanish territory), in search of Dutch sailors reported to be in the current Hidalgo County area.
Other excursions into Hidalgo County were made by Alonzo de León in 1687 in search of a French
fort on the Texas coast and in 1747 by Miguel de la Garza Falcón, who traveled north of the Rio
Grande in search of an area to establish a settlement. Falcón was unimpressed and characterized
the land north of the river as unfit for settlement or for stock raising (Garza 2008a).

Despite Falcón’s opinion, the Spanish crown determined that the region would be settled and
tasked José de Escandόn with colonizing the area along the Rio Grande. In 1746, he was appointed
“conquistador and governor of Nuevo Santander,” the larger region containing the Lower Rio
Grande Valley, and began the process of settling the area that continued throughout his 23-yearlong career. He founded 23 settlements in all (Dixon et al. 2003), 4 of which were located south of
the river in or near present-day Hidalgo County. These settlements, including Reynosa (1749),
Camargo (1749), Mier (1750), and Revilla, or present-day Guerrero (1752) (Garza 2008a), were
different from traditional Spanish colonization efforts in that they were not centered on a strong
military and/or religious presence, but relied instead on civil defense and governance (Dixon et al.
2003). Some of these early settlers migrated and settled north of the river, forming communities
“along the river as well as in the northern reaches of the future county” (Garza 2008a).

In 1753, residents of the area requested official, individual land allotments from the Spanish Crown.
Spain did not begin surveying and granting land possessions until 1767, at which time land was
granted on the basis of merit and seniority. Colonists were classified as “original” (original), “viejo”
(old), and “reciente” (recent) settlers, with the original settlers receiving the perceived best
porciones (land grants). Riverfront acreage was most valuable, as river access gave settlers the
ability to irrigate their land and provided a shipping channel. Thus, surveyors laid out riverfront
porciones in long, narrow strips extending several miles to the north. Larger grants were made
north of the riverfront porciones and were usually composed of significantly more acreage. These
Atkins 100020726/140023

22

IV. Cultural Setting
grants were typically intended for livestock grazing, and many were granted to influential citizens
of Escandόn’s original settlements (Lang and Long 2008).

Early landowners found the land conducive to livestock ranching, and several large-scale ranches
formed in the Lower Rio Grande area. Small communities of ranch workers and their families soon
developed in association with these ranches. The community of Hidalgo near all three of the project
areas was created from one of these early settlements. In 1749, a member of Escandόn’s colony
settled near the location of present-day Hidalgo. The settlement “was known variously as La
Habitaciόn, Rancho San Luis, and San Luisito” (Garza 2008b). Early settlers here spread out to
found their own large ranches in what became Hidalgo County (Garza 2008a).
Ranching continued to characterize the region’s economy through the remainder of the eighteenth
century and into the period of Mexican rule. As original grantees died and passed their lands to
their heirs, the large ranches began to be subdivided. Through these subdivisions, new
communities developed, including La Habitaciόn, Relampago, and Peñitas (Garza 2008a).
Mexico received its independence from Spain in 1821, and the new government continued the
practice of encouraging settlement in the lower Rio Grande Valley, “especially along the navigable
stretch of the river between the Gulf and Roma in Starr County” (Dixon et al. 2003). During this
period, scattered ranching enterprises continued to characterize the local landscape. The key shift
in local development that occurred during the brief period of Mexican ascendency involved the
increasing importance of trade to the regional economy, which was a result of and in turn prompted
an influx of American and European entrepreneurs and settlers “seeking economic opportunities”
(Dixon et al. 2003).

Following Texas independence in 1836, the Rio Grande Valley became a disputed territory, claimed
by both the Republic of Texas and Mexico and later the United States and Mexico. This dispute,
along with other political and military disagreements, led to the Mexican-American War (1846–
1848). During this conflict, Zachary Taylor oversaw the survey of the Old Military Road (41HG230)
that connected Brownsville and Rio Grande City. This route, roughly paralleling the Rio Grande,
became a major transportation artery through the area, linking many established communities and
providing the impetus for the foundation of more communities along its reach. The route likely
paralleled or followed established trails linking area ranches and associated communities.
Following the Mexican-American War, the road continued to serve as a shipping route for cotton
and other goods and as southern Hidalgo County’s main travel artery. By the 1960s, the road was
paved and improved and still serves as a major transportation thoroughfare for the Lower Rio
Grande Valley region (Jones 2008). The recognized route was recorded in 2009 by GTI
Environmental Inc. and is mapped as paralleling Doffin Canal, just south of the IBTC and SH 365
Project APEs.

State Highway 365 Project
By 1850, approximately 40 large ranches were operating in present-day Hidalgo County. The
ranches not only served as the economic mainstay for residents, but also influenced local
community development during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Some of the first
communities established in Hidalgo County were developed in support of large ranches. Various
examples exist within and in the vicinity of the current study area, including La Habitaciόn, at the
site of present-day Hidalgo, which originally formed in association with Rancho San Luis in 1749
(Garza 2008b). The city of McAllen owes its roots to the McAllen Ranch, originally known as the
Santa Anita Ranch, founded circa 1797 by José Manuel Gόmez, an original Spanish grantee (Garza
2008c). Present-day Peñitas originally served as the “common grazing grounds” for Escandόn’s
Villa de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe de Reynosa located south of the Rio Grande in the mideighteenth century. After 1850, the community was associated with numerous populous ranches in
the area, including those of Rόmulo Martínez and Jesús Chapa Cantú (Garza 2008d). The modern
community of Abram, a portion of which falls within the previously proposed Section A APE, was
located along “the original military highway from Brownsville to Fort Ringgold” and, like nearby
Peñitas, served as the common grazing grounds for Reynosa. During the nineteenth century, the
community was associated with the Ojo de Agua, or Watering Hole, Ranch (Norton 2008).
Ranching continued to be an important part of the local economy during the late nineteenth and
early twentieth centuries, and various ranching enterprises were located in the vicinity of the
proposed project areas. The headquarters for the San Juan Plantation, named by owner John
Closner, was located approximately 2,000 ft (0.67 km) south of the proposed Section A/SH 365
Project APE; however, the community that emerged to house the ranch workers and their families,
including a school, appears to have been adjacent to the proposed Section A/SH 365 APE as it
overlaps the proposed IBTC project APE.
Closner began acquiring land in the area in 1884, and his plantation eventually contained
45,000 acres. He was an innovator in the area and transformed the land through a system of
irrigation canals and a water-pumping plant, creating the first irrigation system from the Rio
Grande. The efforts inspired the extensive irrigation systems now present in the area. Diverse crops
were grown on the plantation, including sugarcane, alfalfa, tobacco, vegetables, fruits, melons, and
nuts, and he traded on both sides of the river. Many families worked on the plantation, and a
community developed in the area with a school and general store (McKenna 2008a; THC Sites Atlas
1964).

The adjacent Nathaniel Jackson ranch was also located in the vicinity of the proposed Section
A/SH 365 APE. Jackson, a former slave owner, arrived in Hidalgo County in 1857 with his wife
Matilda Hicks, an African American, as well as their children and his former slaves. Jackson’s ranch
encompassed 5,500 acres, and he “raised livestock and grew vegetables, cotton and sugarcane.” His
property became a haven for runaway slaves, and he constructed a chapel that served the
community associated with his ranch (THC Sites Atlas 2005). Two cemeteries associated with the

IV. Cultural Setting
ranch and a historic marker commemorating the chapel are located in the vicinity of the proposed
Section A/SH 365 APE, though both of the cemeteries are located outside of the APE.

Another ranch of note that historically operated within the vicinity of the proposed Section
A/SH 365 APE is the La Lomita Ranch and Mission. René Guyard, a French merchant living in
Reynosa, willed the ranch to the Oblates of Mary Immaculate, a group of French Catholic
missionaries, in 1861. The transfer included two discontinuous tracts on porciones 55 and 57
originally granted by the Spanish government in 1767. The Oblates purchased the intervening land
on porcione 56 in 1884. The missionaries operated a ranching and farming operation at the site and
built a chapel designated as the headquarters for the Oblate mission for the entire county. The
mission property stretched 15 miles north of the Rio Grande and occupied 2 miles of riverfront
property (Wright 2008).

With the emergence of the railroad and irrigation improvements in the early 1900s, the Oblates
sold most of their land to the north, retaining only the riverfront acreage. It was on this tract in
1912 that the order constructed “a large three-story brick building . . . to house their novitiate
program.” This program subsequently moved to a facility on the Kenedy Ranch until 1962, after
which the building served a variety of uses until 1974 when it and the surrounding property were
“nominally leased for fifty years to La Lomita Farms, a project of the Tropical Texas Center for
Mental Health and Mental Retardation.” The old chapel experienced many periods of refurbishment
and repair and is currently housed within Anzalduas Park located south of the proposed Section
A/SH 365 APE. La Lomita was designated as a National Register Historic District in 1974 (Wright
2008).

Though ranching remained important into the twentieth century, the arrival of the St. Louis,
Brownsville, and Mexico Railroad in 1904 dramatically affected regional development patterns and
local land use. New communities sprang up along the railway and subsequent lines that intersected
this route, and old settlements originally founded around ranches grew into sizable communities.
The city of Donna located north of the current study area was founded in 1904 when a branch of the
St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railroad reached the site. Prior to its arrival, the area was part of
the La Blanca land grant occupied by the Cabazos family. The name was chosen in honor of Donna
Fletcher, a local rancher who later served as postmistress for the town. Donna quickly became a
major regional shipping point for area produce (Garza 2008e).

Run (Runn), located near the southeastern terminus of the proposed IBTC and Section A Project
APEs, was founded in 1903 by George and Ed Ruthven. The Ruthvens came to the lower Rio Grande
Valley from the Beaumont area. They opened a general store that soon became a congregation point
for new settlers in the area. The community was granted a post office in 1904 that operated until
1916 to serve the small community that had formed around the general store. Run began to decline
in the mid-1910s when bandit raids, poor flood control, and growth in the town of Donna to the
north drove many settlers out of the community (Gilbert 2008). Recent levee and construction

State Highway 365 Project
projects have erased numerous features of the community, though archeological remnants may
exist.

Mission, located to the north of the proposed Section A/SH 365 Project APE, was founded in 1907
when John J. Conway and J.W. Hoit purchased 27,000 acres (17,000 from the Oblates of Mary
Immaculate) in the area in anticipation of the wave of new settlers arriving via the railroad. In
1908, the railroad arrived in Mission, and the city incorporated in 1910. Fueled by the development
of irrigation technology that allowed for the production of three crops per year, citrus cultivation,
transport, and processing were major facets of the town’s economy. Mission became known as “the
home of the grapefruit,” and agriculture in the form of cultivation rather than ranching, and later,
oil and gas extraction and the construction of military training centers, fueled its rapid development
in the twentieth century (Heller 2008).

McAllen, which was a small community associated with the McAllen/Santa Anita Ranch established
circa 1797, also experienced a period of growth with the arrival of the railroad. In 1904, when the
Hidalgo and San Miguel Extension of the St. Louis, Brownsville, and Mexico Railway reached the
site, members of the Ballí and McAllen families, proprietors of McAllen Ranch, donated land to
allow the railroad to cross their property. The McAllen Townsite Company formed later that year
and named the new townsite McAllen. McAllen grew at a steady, yet somewhat slower rate than
other railroad towns in the area due to competition from neighboring communities. However, the
town incorporated in 1911 and experienced a population boom during the late 1910s as a result of
federal troops being stationed in the area (Garza 2008c).

During the late 1800s through the mid-1900s, several brickyards were located in or near the
project areas. Some of these earlier brickyards were associated with the large ranches in the area,
while other later enterprises were established solely as brickmaking operations for the area. An
1898 International Boundary map depicts two brickyards near Granjeño, in the vicinity of the
proposed Section A/SH 365 APE. A successful brickmaking enterprise run by a German settler,
Guenther Weiske, was located at or near Madero, another community adjacent to the Section A/SH
365 Project APE. Weiske’s Madero home was constructed of handmade bricks from the El Gavilàn
brickyard near Granjeño. Weiske’s bricks were used in the construction of the La Lomita novitiate,
south of Madero (Cook 1998). It is likely that several other brickyards existed throughout the lower
Rio Grande Valley (Gilbert 2008).
Contemporaneous with the emergence of the railroad, irrigation was also advancing in Hidalgo
County. Advances in irrigation technology and the development of major irrigation systems
increased both large-scale commercial farming and small-scale irrigated farming in the area. The
first irrigation system in the area was developed in 1895 to serve the San Juan Plantation located on
the banks of the Rio Grande (McKenna 2008b). The American Rio Grande Land and Irrigation
Company, incorporated in 1905, constructed a massive system of pumping stations, canals, laterals,

Atkins 100020726/140023

IV. Cultural Setting
and settling basins in Hidalgo County. This system, like many others, was a public system in that it
sold water to private landowners, allowing an increase in irrigated farmland (Goza 2008).
Farmers gained access to new markets via the railroad and improved farming capabilities via
irrigation improvements. Contemporaneously, land speculators began advertising the area’s prime
farmland in the East and Midwest, attracting a new wave of Anglo-American settlers to the area.
The trend of increased farming and railroad expansion continued through the 1930s as more
railroad companies built lines through the area and irrigation improvements continued to multiply.
The area’s transition from a ranch-based economy to one based on truck farming was complete by
1930, when there were 4,321 farms in the county, “more than double the number in 1920,” and
ranching had been relegated to the northern portion of the county. The majority of the farms
engaged in cotton cultivation during this period (Garza 2008a).
Unlike other areas in Texas and the country as a whole, Hidalgo County’s population and the
number of farms increased during the Great Depression. This was due in part to the discovery of oil
in 1934, which continued to represent an important part of the county’s economy through the
remainder of the twentieth century (Garza 2008a). Besides its economic impact, the success of the
oil and gas industry also resulted in significant alterations to traditional local land use patterns, as
oil and gas wells and related roadways became a common interruption in the agricultural
landscape.

In the 1960s, a decline in the cotton market resulted in a dramatic reduction in land values in the
area, and many farmers sold all or portions of their land to developers. Some of these developers
platted new subdivisions near cities, where employment opportunities were available in processing
and other fields. In more-rural areas, some sold small plots at exorbitantly low rates to low-income
families. These areas, known as colonias, were located outside of city limits on unfavorable
farmland. These communities were largely unregulated and were characterized by squalid living
conditions and a lack of public works services. Many of the houses were constructed by hand of
scrap material, and residents obtained water from tainted wells or brought water in from
incorporated areas, often in contaminated containers. By the 1980s, activists began urging officials
to act regarding the high rates of disease in border colonias, but despite these efforts no legislation
was passed (Garcia 2008). Many of these colonias remain in the area and are home to low-income
farm laborers and their families. Two examples near the Section A/SH 365 APE are the existing
colonias that developed around the communities of Abram and Madero beginning in the 1960s
(Garza 2008f; Norton 2008). Although these communities are often ephemeral, there could be
archeological remnants within the Section A/SH 365 APE.

Hidalgo County continues to depend heavily on large-scale agricultural production, processing, and
transportation, though commercial agricultural corporations have replaced the independent
growers as the biggest producers. The Old Military Road is now part of US 281, which links several
international boundary points along the Rio Grande and continues north to the Oklahoma-Texas

state line. Since the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994, truck transport
traffic along the highway has increased in the region as more imports from Mexico are brought to
the United States. Other important facets of the area’s economy and development at present include
oil and gas extraction and tourism.

V. PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
The earliest and most extensive work in the South Texas area is that of A.E. Anderson. From 1908 to
1940, Anderson collected and kept records on data from the south Rio Grande Valley and adjacent
part of Tamaulipas, Mexico. In 1932, he published a brief description of his artifacts from the
Brownsville area (Anderson 1932).

Anderson identified general topographic settings for prehistoric sites. Prewitt (1974) concluded
that there were five distinct settings where sites were most frequently located. These are alluvial
terraces adjacent to streams or rivers; broad upland areas that are often remnants of Pleistocene
alluvial terraces; clay dunes, particularly where these face lagunas and inland lakes; on resacas; and
on the barrier islands. Building upon these previous investigations, Mallouf et al. (1977) developed
a predictive model that facilitated the location of sites through survey. Additionally, he cited eolian
depressions or playas as major water sources that attracted wildlife and vegetation, and therefore,
sites. Some sites were located on more-elevated areas, supposedly, to take advantage of several
playas (Bousman et al. 1990). The types of prehistoric sites encountered in South Texas include
open sites, burned rock middens, shell middens, clay dune sites, lithic sites, rockshelter sites, and
special use sites such as isolated burials, cemeteries, rock art sites, caches, and structures (Black
1989). Historic site types include archeological remains and architectural components from
shipwrecks, industrial buildings, opera houses, schools, forts, courthouses and other civic buildings,
hotels, bridges, post offices, stores, ranches, and houses.
Atkins has conducted several archeological investigations in Hidalgo County. These include the
survey of a transmission line corridor for the Magic Valley Electric Cooperative (Voellinger 1983)
and the archeological assessment of the Central Power and Light Company’s Cross Valley Tie
transmission line (Espey, Huston and Associates, Inc. [EH&A] 1992). Atkins also conducted
archeological investigations in Hidalgo County for Central Power and Light Company’s transmission
line relocation in the Cimarron Subdivision and for Central and South West Services’ Mexico Tie
transmission line project (EH&A 1994) and for a cultural resources survey for a previous Sharyland
transmission line project (Schmidt 1998).

Other major archeological investigations in Hidalgo County include the Hidalgo-Willacy Drainage
Ditch Survey (Andrews 1986; Bousman et al. 1990; Hall et al. 1987; Prewitt and Day 1981; Prewitt
and Mercado-Allinger 1983; Quigg et al. 1989) and the survey conducted for the Hidalgo County
Irrigation District No. 16 (Etchieson and Boyd 1982). Archeological work has been conducted at the
Bentsen-Rio Grande Valley State Park (Hartmann et al. 1995), for the Mission Industrial Site
Infrastructure Project (Houk et al. 1995), and for the Colonias Wastewater Treatment Assistance
Program Project (Jones et al. 1995). A cultural resources survey was also completed for the Texas
Department of Criminal Justice, Edinburg Facility (Rader and Leach-Palm 1995). Archeological and
geomorphological investigations and historic research have been conducted for the Pharr-Reynosa
International Bridge (Boyd et al. 1994; Kibler and Freeman 1993) and for the Anzalduas Inter-

national Crossing (Keller 1995). As seven prehistoric sites were recorded within the proposed APE
for the extant SH 365 Project, Atkins reviewed a sample of 43 prehistoric sites within Hidalgo
County that display characteristics similar these sites for comparative purposes (Table 1). Of these
43, 10 sites occur on a similar landform (highlighted in Table 1), while the remaining sites occur on
uplands. Of these 10 sites, intensive archeological investigations (e.g., those involving trenching or
unit excavation) of any kind has occurred at three sites: 41HG30, 41HG177, and 41HG184. Two
1-x-2-m hand units were excavated at site 41HG30 during a survey phase investigation to a depth of
75 centimeters below the surface (cmbs). Although no cultural features were identified during the
excavations, indications of prehistoric cultural activity were present and the site was recommended
for testing (Brown 1972). Sites 41HG177 and 41HG184 have been subjected to formal archeological
testing, the results of which indicated site 41HG177 lacked cultural features, while features were
identified at site 41HG184 (Brown et al. 2003; Ringstaff et al. 2003). Site 41HG184 was
subsequently recommended eligible for inclusion in the NRHP (Ringstaff et al. 2003); it was
determined eligible by the THC and designated a SAL in 2003. Site 41HG184 is located 2.7 miles
northwest of the western terminus of the proposed SH 365 APE.

VI. METHODS
This section provides the methods used in completing the archeological survey of the proposed
Section A/SH 365, Section C, and IBTC Projects. This includes the methodology for conducting the
background records review for archeological resources, intensive pedestrian survey, geoarcheological investigations, and site assessments. The methods complied with the applicable
standards as defined in 13 TAC 26.20 and policies of the THC and the CTA standards.

BACKGROUND REVIEW

Atkins performed a background literature review to determine whether the project areas had been
previously surveyed for cultural resources and whether any previously recorded archeological sites
are located within or near the project areas. To conduct this review, an Atkins archeologist
reviewed the Harlingen, Mission, Pharr, and Las Milpas U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
topographic quadrangle maps at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) at the Pickle
Research Campus at The University of Texas at Austin, and searched the THC’s Texas Archeological
Sites Atlas (a restricted-access online database) and site files at TARL. These sources provided
information on the nature and location of previously conducted archeological surveys and
previously recorded archeological sites. In addition to identifying recorded archeological sites, the
review included the following types of information on the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas: NRHP
properties, SALs, Official Texas Historical Markers, Registered Texas Historic Landmarks,
cemeteries, and local neighborhood surveys.

DEFINING HIGH PROBABILITY AREAS

Previously conducted archeological surveys have demonstrated that the primary factor governing
most prehistoric site location is distance to a natural water source. A large portion of the land
traversed by the projects is within the alluvial valley of the Rio Grande. Specifically, most of the
surveyed routes traverse Holocene-aged deposits associated with the T1 alluvial terrace. A
characteristic feature of this area is numerous resacas or abandoned channels. Lands surrounding
these natural features as well as terrace or natural levee remnants are considered high probability
areas (HPAs) for prehistoric sites. All APE within 100 m of a resaca or natural stream was proposed
for shovel testing at intervals conforming to those established by the CTA or systematic exploratory
mechanical trenching according to intervals determined in consultation with TxDOT and THC
(Burden 2013). Historic HPAs were developed by the project historian/ archeologist based on
examination of aerial photographs and historic topographic maps and these areas were proposed
for shovel testing in accordance with CTA guidelines as well.
Terrace or natural levee remnants are found within the Holocene alluvial valley of the Rio Grande
and appear as slightly elevated areas. Previously investigated site 41HG184, located 0.5 mile north
of the Section A APE and 2.8 miles northwest of the Section A/SH 365 APE, is a buried prehistoric
Atkins 100020726/140023

33

State Highway 365 Project
site that occurs on such a landform. In addition to the alluvial HPAs found along resacas and
streams, a small portion in the western part of the Section A/SH 365 APE traverses upland deposits
of the Lissie Formation. These upland deposits contain siliceous gravels, which were a source for
stone tools. Previously recorded site 41HG142 is a large prehistoric site situated on an upland
landform of the Lissie Formation.

FIELD METHODS

The field survey consisted of two to three archeologists walking the accessible portions of the
archeological APE. These areas were investigated with an intensive pedestrian survey utilizing
shovel testing or a combination of shovel testing and systematic trenching. The entire Section A/SH
365 and IBTC archeological APE, as well as portions of the previously proposed Section C
archeological APE, were inspected by a team of archeologists. The transect method was employed
in completing the survey, with transects spaced at approximately 30-m (98-ft) intervals. Areas
disturbed by industry and urban/suburban development were not shovel tested or trenched.
However, these areas were photo documented.

The THC and CTA survey standards stipulate a minimum of 16 shovel tests per linear mile;
however, survey within the SH 365 APE deviated from this standard under the following
conditions:
•

•

Areas of extensive modern subsurface disturbance,

Agricultural fields in low probability areas with an average ground surface visibility of
85 percent characterized by clay on the surface were not shovel tested but the surface of
these plowed areas was visually inspected. Results of subsequent systematic mechanical
trenching of portions of the SH 365 APE further indicate that shovel testing of these areas
given the soil characteristics and general vertical APE is inefficient and that characteristics
of prehistoric subsurface archeological deposits in this area are very difficult to identify in
shovel tests (this will be discussed further in the Section IX of this report).

All shovel tests were excavated in 20-cm arbitrary levels to 1 m in depth or culturally sterile
deposits, whichever came first. The matrix was screened through ¼-inch hardware mesh. The
location of each shovel test was plotted using a handheld Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver,
and each test was recorded on appropriate project field forms. All shovel tests were excavated on
private property.

In August 2013, subsequent to review of a preliminary draft of this report, TxDOT initiated a change
in survey strategy for the SH 365 project, which lead to a reevaluation of survey methods within all
HPAs of the project, excepting those within the overlap zone of the IBTC project, which had already
been approved by the THC. Further consultation determined that a program of systematic
mechanical trenching was needed within these HPAs in order to identify archeological sites within
the generally defined 1 m vertical APE. Therefore, a series of exploratory trenches (n = 50) were

Atkins 100020726/140023

34

VI. Methods
excavated at an interval of 1 per 2 acres of HPA to a depth of approximately 1 m in these areas. The
placement of the trenches within the HPAs was governed by conditions on the ground, aided by the
results of the pedestrian survey, and by the judgment of the project geoarcheologist. Where the
vertical APE for archeological resources is greater than 1 m (i.e., proposed overpass and bridge
locations) within the HPAs, geoarcheological investigations utilizing mechanical excavation
equipment were conducted to examine the alluvial deposits for deeply buried prehistoric sites. This
work was performed by a staff geoarcheologist in conjunction with completion of the pedestrian
survey and exploratory trenching. Backhoe trenches at these locations were excavated to a depth
about 2 m deep (6.5 ft) . Each trench was excavated to a depth of about 1.2 m (4 ft), at which time
the trench walls were scraped, and all soils and sediments observed in the trenches were described
using standard soil description nomenclature. The remaining 0.75 m (2.5 ft) was excavated, but the
trench was not entered. Rather, the backdirt removed from these depths was examined for cultural
remains. All trenching was monitored by an experienced archeologist or geoarcheologist while
excavations were underway. Placement of these trenches was also governed by conditions on the
ground, aided by the results of the pedestrian survey, and by the judgment of the project
geoarcheologist.

Stratigraphic soils descriptions were recorded for each trench excavated during the survey. The
entire process was thoroughly photo documented and the locations of trenches recorded on a handheld Trimble GeoXT global positioning system device. All trenches were backfilled and leveled upon
completion of excavation and recording. All backhoe trenches were excavated on private property.
When an archeological site was encountered, a State of Texas Archeological Site Data Form was
completed. A site sketch map was made and the site was photographed. A few artifacts (lithic flakes,
cut mussel shell, historic glass, cut nail) as well as samples of feature fill, clay balls, mussel and snail
shell, and faunal bone were collected from sites 41HG249–41HG254 during the site delineation
phase work within the SH 365 APE; no other artifacts were collected during the surveys. Artifacts
not collected were described in sufficient detail, and a photographic record was kept of all
diagnostic artifacts during fieldwork.
Collected items will be curated in conjunction with pending mitigation phase work for sites
41HG249–41HG254 if our recommendations of eligibility are concurred by the THC. If the sites are
instead avoided, all artifacts and special samples will be curated along with all notes, drawings,
daily journals, site record forms, photographs, and other documentation generated in association
with the survey phase at TARL.

Site Assessments

Subsequent to the initial exploratory trenching during the intensive survey phase, Atkins developed
a plan to date and delineate possible prehistoric archeological sites in consultation with TxDOT
Environmental Affairs Division (ENV) archeologist Chris Ringstaff (via phone conference on
December 18, 2013). This consisted of a staged approach that entailed submitting samples
Atkins 100020726/140023

35

State Highway 365 Project
recovered from the sites for macrobotanical analysis and then accelerator mass spectrometry
(AMS) dating analysis (Stage 1). Results of these analyses then dictated which site locations would
be subjected to delineation through additional exploratory trenching (Stage 2).

Stage 1 – Dating Collected Samples

A series of samples collected by Dr. Frederick from trenches containing cultural features and
materials was determined suitable for dating analysis. Dating these samples prior to further work
at each site enabled investigators to determine if any of the sites were not prehistoric in age, which
was uncertain due to the lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts observed at each site. As it was
important to determine what substances were being submitted for dating, Atkins contacted a
leading macrobotanical expert, Dr. Leslie L. Bush of Macrobotanical Analysis, Austin, Texas, to
analyze up to eight of the samples in order to determine the nature of the carbon or other plant
materials suitable for dating analysis. Samples for macrobotanical analysis were chosen based on
context. Bulk soil samples from feature fill were subjected to flotation prior to analysis.
Macrobotanical samples determined suitable for dating were then submitted to Beta Analytic of
Miami, Florida, and subjected to AMS dating analysis.

Stage 2 – Site Delineation

All sites not eliminated from consideration due to AMS dating results were delineated utilizing
mechanical means to determine the horizontal and vertical extent of associated cultural deposits
within the APE. Site delineations employed the least invasive means while maintaining efficiency
for timeframe. Because soils at the site locations are clay of varying compaction and shovel testing
would have been useless in identifying features, mechanical trenching was utilized to delineate the
sites.
Mechanical trenching was accomplished using a backhoe equipped with a 60-cm-wide, smoothbladed bucket. Using the initial positive exploratory trench as a center point, a series of trenches
were excavated in four cardinal directions at a distance of 40 m as permitted within the APE. Up to
two additional discretionary trenches were then excavated at 40 m away from selected positive
trenches as permitted within the APE to further define any observed cultural deposits. Placement of
trenches was governed by field conditions and the discretion of the field archeologist.

Trenches were approximately 1 m (3 ft) wide, 5 m (16 ft) long, and 1 m deep within the SH 365
APE. Trench excavation occurred to a depth of approximately 1 m unless terminated at a shallower
depth upon discovery of cultural features. Both walls of all trenches were cleaned by hand with a
trowel prior to recording. All trenches were photo documented and left intact for possible future
testing or mitigation. Trenches containing cultural deposits, as well as exposed cultural features,
were formally documented. All trenches were backfilled upon completion of trench documentation.

exploratory trenching undertaken for the SH 365 project between November and December 2013
are detailed in Section VIII as these findings are relevant beyond the boundaries of the proposed SH
365 APE. As a portion of the original IBTC Project (Permit 5683) overlaps a portion of the area
covered by Permit 5124, findings for the overlap area are included in the Section A/SH 365
discussion below and are also detailed in a separate report accepted by the THC in April 2011 (see
Appendix A). Findings for the US 281/IBTC overpass area, which were removed from the report for
TAC Permit 5683 (see Appendix A) due to subsequent project modifications, are also included in
the Section A/SH 365 discussion below as this area overlaps the area covered by Permit 5683.
However, discussion of site 41HG237, which is solely within a portion of the IBTC project area that
does not overlap any of the aforementioned projects, only appears in Appendix A. Note that
discussion of the background review results are limited only to the Section A/SH 365 proposed
projects. Also, due to confusion concerning the exact width of the archeological APE at the time of
survey, a few shovel tests were excavated just outside the archeological APE for the Section A and
Section C projects. This issue was later corrected but these shovel tests are illustrated in
subsequent figures.

BACKGROUND REVIEW

A review of archeological site records maintained at TARL in 2008 (updated June 15, 2012)
revealed that 10 prehistoric archeological sites, 6 historic sites, and 4 multicomponent sites are
within 0.6 mile (1 km) of the proposed Section A/SH 365 APE (Table 2). The prehistoric sites fall
into only a few categories based on materials observed or collected. Hearth materials, subsistence
data, tools, or other evidence of occupations is evident at nearly all of the sites. A few sites appear to
have been lithic workshops where initial stages of tool production occurred. These sites were
located on the Lissie or Goliad geological formations. A few sites contained only light scatters of
stone tools, tool fragments, or debitage. The function of these latter sites is difficult to ascertain.
Nearly all of them were recorded as being limited to the present-day ground surface, though deeply
stratified site 41HG186, located adjacent to a resaca, yielded cultural material at depths of 50 to
110 cm (Meadows et al. 2003). Site size ranges from 50 m in diameter (41HG144) to 300 x 500 m
(41HG142). Historic sites near the project areas consist of home sites, a cotton gin, and a road.

In addition, portions of the Section A/SH 365 APE run adjacent to the northern boundary of the La
Lomita Historic District and cross through the Louisiana-Rio Grande Canal Company Irrigation
System Historic Property. The La Lomita Historic District includes La Lomita Chapel, 122 acres of
the original ranch lands of the Oblate Fathers, and St. Peter’s Novitiate; its period of significance is
1899–1912. Irrigation district maps of the area indicate that some portions of the Section A/SH 365
APE cross a series of unlined irrigation canals associated with the Louisiana-Rio Grande Canal

VII. Results
(the Louisiana-Rio Grande Canal Company) has been listed in the NRHP, it is understood by TxDOT
and the THC that all of the irrigation systems are to be treated as historic properties (TxDOT letter
dated July 26, 2004). However, as the Louisiana-Rio Grande Canal Company Irrigation System is a
historic-age property and is not designated as an archeological site, impacts of the undertaking on
this historic resource are addressed in a historic property reconnaissance survey of the APE (Harris
and McWhorter 2013).

In addition to these historic districts, the records search revealed a historical marker for the Spider
Web Railroad is positioned near the entrance to the La Lomita Historic District on the south side of
West Military Highway/FM 1016, adjacent to the proposed Section A/SH 365 APE. The Spiderweb
Railroad was actually part of the San Benito & Rio Grande Valley Railroad begun by Sam A.
Robertson, a local civil engineer and land promoter, in 1912 during a period of growth in the
agricultural development of South Texas. The railroad was nicknamed “Spiderweb” due to its
network of lines and spurs (Texas Historic Sites Atlas 1982).

A total of 33 previous investigations have been conducted within 0.6 mile (1 km) of the proposed
Section A/SH 365 APE (Table 3). These investigations were performed for a variety of infrastructure (transportation, water and wastewater lines, pipelines, and flood control) and government projects (border inspection stations and Social Security Administration buildings).

INTENSIVE SURVEY
Section A/SH 365

Survey of the Section A APE began January 15, 2009, and survey of the subsequent SH 365 APE was
completed February 25, 2014. Many of the parcels within the APE were recently plowed, recently
harvested, or contained standing crops of primarily sorghum, sugarcane, and general produce. One
parcel featured a mature citrus orchard at the time of survey (Figure 5, Sheet 4). The proposed
Section A and SH 365 APEs cover a total of 1,697 acres. A total of 889 acres were surveyed and 421
shovel tests were excavated within these areas. A total of 460 acres were inaccessible at the time of
survey due to lack of ROE (see Figure 5) and one of these areas southwest of the intersection of East
Thomas Drive and South “I” Road (see Figure 5, Sheet 8) requires no further consideration as it was
eliminated from the APE due to changes in project alignment in April 2014. Although a portion of
the orchard parcel is classified as HPA for prehistoric archeological materials (see Figure 5, Sheet
4), obvious signs of disturbance consisting of cultivation of this commercial orchard as well as
significant bioturbation below the plow zone due to extensive, intertwined root growth from a large
number of closely spaced mature grapefruit trees that would likely have displaced any existing
cultural deposits within this parcel suggest further shovel testing or trenching in this area is not
likely to identify intact archeological deposits, and so no further survey is warranted within this
parcel.

VII. Results
In addition to the intensive survey with shovel testing, a Project Geoarcheologist monitored
mechanical trenching within (1) HPAs at overpass and bridge locations where the vertical APE for
archeological resources is greater than 1 m, and (2) HPAs at where the vertical APE for
archeological resources is generally defined as 1 m.

Originally, exploratory trenching was proposed at eight locations of proposed overpass and pilings
for bridges; however, three locations were determined to be disturbed as a result of pedestrian
survey and were no longer considered suitable for trenching. Therefore, a total of seven trenches
were excavated at five overpass/bridge locations within the Section A/SH 365 APE (see Figure 5,
Sheets 6, 8, and 9). In addition, a total of 50 exploratory trenches were excavated in HPAs within the
SH 365 APE were the vertical APE was generally defined as 1 m. Detailed descriptions of these
trenches as well as 32 subsequent site delineation trenches are included in Appendix C.

As a result of the survey, nine newly recorded archeological sites, 41HG223, 41HG224, and
41HG249–41HG255, were identified and one previously recorded site 41HG230 was revisited; only
sites 41HG224, 41HG230, and 41HG249–41HG255 are located within the current proposed SH 365
APE (see Appendix B). One additional previously recorded archeological site, 41HG142, was
identified within the Section A APE during the records review but was not revisited during survey
due to lack of ROE. However, site 41HG142 is no longer within the proposed Segment A/SH 365
APE. One other previously recorded site, 41HG30, was located adjacent to the Section A/SH 365
APE and so the portion of APE nearest the site was investigated to determine whether or not site
deposits extended into the APE. One isolated find, IFRS1, was also recorded within the APE.
Locations of previously recorded sites, newly recorded sites, and the isolated find are illustrated in
Appendix B. The sites and isolate are described below. Trench profiles and descriptions from
trenched sites are detailed in Appendix C. A copy of the results of the macrobotanical analysis is
included in Appendix D, and copies of the AMS dating results from Beta Analytic are included in
Appendix E. No sites associated with the La Lomita Historic District were observed during survey,
and no intact remains of the Spiderweb Railroad were discerned within the APE. However,
disturbed remains of a prior railroad bed (e.g., wooden ties, metal screws, etc.) were noted
alongside the modern Union Pacific Railroad within the APE north of West Military Highway/
FM 1016, but there were no indications that this debris was older than 50 years of age.
Site 41HG30: Site 41HG30 is a previously recorded open prehistoric campsite that measures
approximately 60 x 30 m located on a leveled floodplain approximately 100 m north of the
Section A/SH 365 APE between Jackson Road and US 281 (see Appendix B, Sheet 7). The site is
adjacent to an alignment of the Main Floodway levee. Additional irrigation canals are located to the
north and southwest of the site boundaries. The site was initially recorded in 1972 during survey in
advance of the south Main Floodway (Hackney Lake Inlet) levee relocation. At the time, cultural
artifacts were observed on the surface and below surface based on excavations of two hand units
(Brown 1972). These materials included chert debitage, one ceramic sherd, faunal and mussel shell
fragments, burned clay, and historic glass.

State Highway 365 Project
Pedestrian survey and excavation of 13 shovel tests in the vicinity of site 41HG30 near the SH 365
APE boundaries by Atkins in 2009 revealed no surficial or subsurface cultural materials or deposits.
Based on this evidence, the site does not extend into the SH 365 APE. Therefore, no adverse effects
to site 41HG30 are anticipated as a result of the current SH 365 undertaking.

Site 41HG142: Site 41HG142 (also known as the Terrace Pasture site) is a large prehistoric
campsite measuring approximately 300 x 500 m located on a Pleistocene-aged terrace about
1.3 miles (2 km) north of the Rio Grande (see Appendix B, Sheet 1). The site was recorded by Don
Kumpe in 1990 (Kumpe 1990). Kumpe’s surface collections at the site recovered prehistoric stone
tools including a triangular dart point, a Bell or Andice-like dart point, a side-notched arrow point, a
Starr arrow point, stone knives and a scraper. Hearths and shells were also noted. The site was
thought to have some depth, though no subsurface investigations were performed. According to the
site form, the recorder recommended the site eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and for nomination
as an SAL.

In 2001, the site was revisited during a cultural resources survey of the La Joya Water Supply
Corporation Eastern Planning area. As a result of the revisit, surveyors expanded the eastern
boundary of the site to include the Carlos Acres subdivision (Whitsett and Davis 2001). This portion
of the site, however, had been adversely impacted by clearing, road construction, and house
construction. No buried cultural deposits were identified at that time, and the remainder of the site,
specifically the portion extending onto the terrace to the west, was not included in the survey area.

Atkins was not granted ROE to this parcel when survey of Section A began in 2008 and so the site
was not revisited at that time. This parcel is also not included in the current SH 365 APE and
therefore was not revisited by surveyors in 2013. However, based on what is currently known
about 41HG142, it is a multicomponent prehistoric site, with occupations dating from the Early
Archaic (3000–5000 B.C.) to Late Prehistoric (A.D. 800–1400). The site has been adversely impacted
by land clearing, cultivation, and terracing. The eastern extension has also been severely impacted
by house and road construction, and it is uncertain whether any buried cultural deposits associated
with 41HG142 occur within the Section A APE. Nonetheless, as this portion of the Section A APE is
no longer scheduled for construction, Atkins does not recommend further survey to determine
adverse effects to the site at this time.

Site 41HG223: Site 41HG223 is a newly recorded prehistoric campsite of indeterminate age
identified by Atkins archeologists 100 m south of US 83 within the Section A APE in 2009 (see
Appendix B, Sheet 1). The site lies in a plowed field on a broad ridge top overlooking the Rio Grande
floodplain (Figure 6). Ground surface visibility was approximately 90 percent. All artifacts were
noted on the ground surface; seven shovel tests were negative for cultural materials (Figure 7).
Artifacts located were 10 pieces of debitage, 1 biface, and 1 piece of fire-cracked rock (Figure 8).
The absence of features, other than one piece of fire-cracked rock, and diagnostic artifacts greatly
limits the potential for the site to harbor research value. Furthermore, the site is disturbed from

VII. Results
terracing and plowing activity and is eroded. Based on these results, Atkins recommends that site
41HG223 does not appear to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under any criteria and is not
eligible for nomination as a SAL.

Figure 6. Overview of site 41HG223.
Site 41HG224: Site 41HG224 is a historic site located on the west side of San Juan Road, just south
of the canal between Anaya Road and Las Milpas Road (see Appendix B, Sheet 8; Figure 9). The site
was recorded during survey of the Section A APE in 2009, was included in the IBTC survey report
(see Appendix A), and now lies within the current SH 365 APE. Cultural features present at the site
include a cement foundation, a cement walkway, a brick cistern, and several piles of structural
debris created by mechanical clearing (Figure 10). Artifacts observed at the location include glass,
stoneware, whiteware, a glass marble, and local bricks (Figure 11). Modern trash has also been
dumped at the site. Several trees at the site appeared burned, and it is probable that the structures
were burned prior to their demolition. The site appears to be a multifunctional cinder-block
construction complex, likely dating to the mid-twentieth century. As reported in the IBTC final
report (see Appendix A) and concurred by THC, there is little potential that the site would yield
significant amounts of additional information with more-intensive investigation. No elements that
could contribute to the site’s potential eligibility for listing in the NRHP or nomination as a SAL
were observed within the SH 365 APE. Therefore, no adverse effects are anticipated and no further
investigation of this site is recommended in association with the proposed SH 365 Project.

Site 41HG230: Previously recorded site 41HG230 is a historic military road that follows the border
from La Puerta to Brownsville, Texas (see Appendix B, Sheets 4 and 5). The roadway is widely
believed to be a 92-mile-long supply route laid out by General Zachary Taylor during the MexicanAmerican War to supply men in northern Mexico. The original road led from Fort Ringgold in Rio
Grande City to Fort Brown in Brownsville, paralleling the Rio Grande on either the floodplain or the
terraces above the river. The majority of the route has been paved over for the creation of US 281.
Other sections have been impacted by agricultural activities, canals, and erosion.

Although the road had been noted by previous investigations, the actual alignment or trinomial was
not documented until 2009 by Sergio Iruegas of GTI Environmental Inc. Based on information from
the THC’s restricted-access Texas Archeological Sites Atlas, Iruegas determined the current mapped
alignment from archival research conducted during eligibility testing at prehistoric site 41HG177.
This location is approximately 8 miles (14 km) northwest of the western terminus of the Section A
APE and 14 miles (24 km) northwest of the western terminus of the SH 365 APE. Here, Iruegas
documented subsurface remains of the road including large pieces of cedar and cobblestones at a
depth of 46 cm. He recommended the site eligible for listing in the NRHP under Criteria A and D and
for nomination as an SAL, and noted that the road may be part of a potential NRHP archeological
district associated with Mexican-American War battlefield sites in the area.

State Highway 365 Project
Atkins archeologists revisited the site as plotted on the THC’s restricted-access Texas Archeological
Sites Atlas where it crosses the SH 365 APE in 2013. Results of the survey indicate that large
portions of the site within the current SH 365 APE have been paved over by FM 1016, FM 494, and
Doffin Canal Road. As no indications of the historic elements of the road were observed, it appears
these have been severely disturbed or removed by modern roadway construction (Figure 12).
Based on this evidence, Atkins recommends that the portions of 41HG230 mapped within the
proposed SH 365 APE lack integrity and are not eligible for listing in the NRHP under any criteria or
for nomination as an SAL. Therefore, no further investigation of this site is recommended in association with the proposed SH 365 Project.

41HG249 (Resaca Vieja Site): Site 41HG249 is a prehistoric open campsite that is approximately
80 m east-west by 60 m north-south within the APE (Figure 13; see Appendix B, Sheet 5). The site is
located in a cultivated agricultural field on level ground north of the International Boundary and
Water Commission (IBWC) north levee (Figure 14). The site lies 1.4 kilometers (km) (0.87 mile)
north of the modern channel of the Rio Grande. Soils at the site are mapped as Reynosa silty clay
loam, 0–1 percent slopes. Ground surface visibility at the site at the time of survey was 100 percent
in the eastern portion of the site and zero percent in the western half of the site where a
bermudagrass hay field is located.

Figure 14. Overview of 41HG249, facing east.
Six trenches were excavated at the site during the course of site delineation and recording (see
Figure 13). The site exhibits multiple stratified occupation zones that extend from approximately
35 cmbs to roughly 120 cmbs as well as two distinctly different landscape/stratigraphic settings
(see Appendix B). Fourteen cultural features were revealed during trenching (Table 4). Photos of
selected features are illustrated on Figures 15–23. Three features (F3, F4, and F8b) appear to be
natural, but most appear to be either hearth or hearth-like in situ burns (e.g., F1, F2, F12, and F13)
or pits containing thermal refuse (burned earth, charcoal or both, e.g., F5, F5a, F8, and F11). The
site also straddles a buried abandoned channel of the Rio Grande or resaca, which is evident on the
1936 USGS topographic quadrangle map but the deposits in these two areas are, at this time,
impossible to correlate without connecting trench excavations.
In 1936, the floor of the arcuate depression that defines the resaca was mapped as 4 ft below the
adjacent delta surface, but today the relief is now about half that owing to leveling and filling of the
surface for irrigation agriculture. This portion of the Rio Grande delta is mapped by the Bureau of
Economic Geology (1992) as predominantly sandy Holocene alluvium. The soil mapped within the
resaca depression is the Reynosa silty clay loam, saline, 0–1 percent slopes whereas the soil
mapped on the level land adjacent to the resaca is the Reynosa silty clay loam, 0–1 percent slopes.

The exposures revealed during trenching suggest the presence of three different age deposits at the
site: Introduced Fill, Late Holocene Alluvium, and Middle–Late Holocene Alluvium. The deposits
present within the resaca are significantly different from those of the level delta surface adjacent to
it and at this time are difficult to correlate. Figure 24 illustrates a west to east cross-section of the
site using the profiles of three trenches (11.4, 11.0, and 11.2).

The oldest deposit exposed within the trench excavations, Middle-Late Holocene Alluvium, was
present at the base of trenches 11.0 and 11.2 and was generally a silty clay loam that exhibited a
small number of small pedogenic calcium carbonate nodules. A concentration of burned earth
associated with a prehistoric occupation was observed in the west wall of Trench 11.2 (Feature 5a
[F5a]) within the Middle-Late Holocene Alluvium at a depth of 130 cmbs.

The majority of the evidence of human occupation of the site was observed with the Late Holocene
Alluvium. This deposit forms a veneer on top of the Middle-Late Holocene Alluvium that is in some
places less than a meter thick, and presumed to comprise almost all of the deposits within the
resaca. On the level floodplain surface adjacent to the resaca, the Late Holocene Alluvium ranged
from relatively massive deposits of silt loam (as in Trench 11.0), to distinctly stratified alternating
textured silt loam and loam/sandy loam near channel overbank deposits (as was observed in
Trenches 11.1, 11.2, and 11.5). The sand beds within the stratified sediments, which were faintly
visible on the troweled trench walls, facilitated seeing many of the cultural features, especially the
pits, which cross-cut the otherwise layered alluvial deposits. An example of the complex crosscutting relationships observed at the site are shown on Figure 25.
The deposits of the resaca were, as noted previously, distinctly different from those of the adjacent
level delta surface and were exposed by two trenches (11.4 and 11.6). The Late Holocene Alluvium
within the resaca exhibited two components: a channel sand and a mud plug. The lowest deposits
exposed within the resaca comprised fine sand that ranged from medium to thick bedded, and
occasionally contains thin mud drapes. This deposit is overlain by a thick (70–80 cm) mud that
ranges in texture from clay to silty clay and contains at least two occupation zones. Both of the
occupation zones observed in this mud preserved bone as well as abundant charcoal and small
fragments of burned earth, and the preservation or organic remains here is clearly better than in
the sandy to loamy sediments outside of the resaca.

The third and youngest deposit exposed by trenching at the site is a half-meter thick body of
Introduced Fill that has been added to this depression since the mid-1930s. This brown silty clay
contains glass and is most likely the result of land leveling done to aid in irrigating this landscape.

Charcoal was collected from one of the buried occupation zones during the delineation phase. Only
one durable artifact was noted at the site, an isolated find lithic flake found at 65 cmbs along the
southwest wall of Trench 11.2 at the bottom of 10-cm-wide sand layer (zone 6) (Figure 26), but
bones were found within the resaca deposits within Trench 11.6 (Figure 27). A large fragment of
burned daub was found within Feature 2 in the uppermost component (see Figure 16). This
fragment may exhibit impressions consistent with structural timbers (Figure 28). The absence of
durable artifacts is overshadowed by the presence of multiple features such as pits and in situ
burned surfaces (delineated by continuous reddened reaction rims) that appear to be hearths.

VII. Results
During the survey phase in November 2013, one flotation sample was recovered at the site from an
occupation zone marked by a light scatter of small fragments of reddened burned earth, charcoal,
and Rabdotus snail shells between 65 and 75 cmbs in Trench 11.0. This sample was later subjected
to macrobotanical analysis and ultimately submitted for AMS dating analysis. Flotation and
macrobotanical analysis revealed the sample (Flot 7) contained Acacia sp., mesquite, and hardwood
(see Appendix C). Carbon dating analysis of 0.16 gram of charred Acacia sp. revealed the sample
dates to Cal A.D. 1160 to 1260 (Cal B.P. 790 to 690) or 830±30 years B.P. (Beta-370062) (see
Appendix D), which places it within the Late Prehistoric cultural division (possible Austin phase).
As can be seen on Figure 24, this sample was collected from the lower half of the Late Holocene
Alluvium within this trench.

Site 41HG249 appears to be a series of short-term prehistoric occupations located on the edge of a
resaca that were subsequently buried by flood deposits during the Late Prehistoric and possibly
Historic periods with the oldest occupation possibly dating to the Archaic period. The site displays a
very high degree of integrity, although it is possible deposits were impacted by construction of the
linear borrow pit that borders the site to the south. Sites of this age within the Rio Grande delta
have rarely been investigated archeologically and given the integrity of the site and evidence of
substantial and repeated human habitation, the research value of these deposits is considerable.
Therefore, it is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that site 41HG249 maintains the potential
to yield information important in prehistory and is recommended eligible for inclusion in the NRHP
under Criterion D as well as for nomination as a SAL. Avoidance of the site by the proposed highway
construction is recommended. If avoidance is not feasible, Atkins recommends adverse effects to
the site be mitigated through research-oriented data recovery excavations.

41HG250 (Mejillon Site): Site 41HG250 is a prehistoric open campsite that is approximately 60 m
east-west by 60 m north-south within the APE (Figure 29; see Appendix B, Sheet 5). The site is
located in a cultivated agricultural field on level ground north of a linear borrow pit that in turn lies
adjacent to the IBWC north levee bordering the north side of the Hackney Lake Inlet (Figure 30).
The site lies 1.4 km (0.87 mile) north of the modern channel of the Rio Grande and a short distance
east of an abandoned channel of the Rio Grande or resaca. Soils at the site are mapped as Reynosa
silty clay loam, 0–1 percent slopes. Ground surface visibility at the site at the time of survey was
100 percent.

Five trenches were excavated at the site during the course of site delineation and recording (see
Figure 29). The site exhibits multiple stratified occupation zones that extend from approximately
40 cmbs to roughly 130 cmbs (see Appendix B) and 13 cultural features (Table 5). Features are
illustrated on Figures 31–43. This site appears to have one prominent occupation between 80 and
100 cmbs, and traces of occupations between 40–50 cmbs and again around 130 cmbs. The middle
occupation yielded a total of five pieces of lithic debitage from an occupation zone primarily
expressed by charcoal, burned earth, and Rabdotus snail shells. A freshwater mussel shell workshop
was noted within this occupation in Trench 12.3, and this appeared to be quite spatially discrete.

Description
Occupation zone with flakes, burned earth,
charcoal and snails.
Feature 1: Patch of light matrix surrounded by
darker matrix, possible post mold (17 x 19 cm)
that appeared on trench floor. Fill trends from
light colored at top where first discovered to
darker colored with depth.
Feature 2: Pit (Depression 1) (70 cm wide x 45
cm deep) exposed on the west trench wall that
contained charcoal and burned clay nodules.
This pit cut the occupation zone around
70 cmbs.
Feature 3: A broad, shallow pit (Depression 2)
containing numerous small fragments of
burned earth and charcoal, as well as small
pieces of shell. This feature was about 1 m
wide and 1 cm deep and appeared to be
located immediately beneath the main
occupation, starting about 100 cmbs.
Feature 4: Sand filled pit (Depression 3) that
cut s into the occupation zone (Stratigraphic
zone 7) and may be a scour-related feature.
Unlike Feature 2, which has fill with burned
earth, this feature has clean sand fill and is
formed by cutting through the occupation
zone. Possibly natural feature.
Feature 5: Sand filled pit (Depression 4) that
cut s into the occupation zone (Stratigraphic
zone 7) and may be a scour-related feature.
Unlike Feature 2, which has fill with burned
earth, this feature has clean sand fill and is
formed by cutting through the occupation
zone. Possibly natural feature.
Feature 6: An irregularly- shaped patch of
charcoal stained earth with flecks of Rabdotus
snail shell exposed on trench floor;
approximately 25 x 35 cm in diameter, 1.6–
2.1 m from the south end of the trench.
Feature 7: A roughly circular area of charcoal
stained earth 26 x 25 cm in diameter and
located 5.4–5.6m from southeast end of
trench.
An occupation zone , but this surface was
somewhat undulose and varied in depth
between 80 and 100 cm.

Description
Feature 8: One quarter of a roughly circular pit
filled with dark colored soil, burned earth,
charcoal, and small pieces of Rabdotus snail
shell. Originated at the occupation zone and
was ~22 cm deep.
Feature 9: Large concentration of possible
worked/cut and unworked freshwater mussel
and snail shell with charcoal and faunal bone
located between 2 and 3 m north of the SE end
of the trench.
Feature 10: An elongate patch of dark colored
earth containing small fragments of burned
earth, charcoal, and Rabdotus snail shell that
was exposed on the trench floor and extended
into the east trench wall, possible hearth.
Along its long axis this feature was 1.1 m long
and about 50 cm wide perpendicular to that.
Feature 11: A linear, ditch-like soil anomaly
that cut diagonally across the trench from NW
to SE and was filled with dense compacted
clay. This feature originated at the base of the
plowzone and extended to a depth of 90 cm
and below it the soil was much drier. The
dense compaction of this deposit is consistent
with filling with aid of modern heavy
equipment. This may be a filed in old acequia.
Feature 12: Shallow pit exposed in the west
trench wall and associated with a probable
occupation zone between 40–50 cmbs. The pit
was 1.3 m wide, 25–30 cm deep, and
contained 10–15 cm of dark colored fill with
charcoal and burned earth, and then was filled
in by a thicker wedge of flood sand associated
with bed that buried the occupation zone.
Feature 13: A complex suite located on the
north and east walls of the trench. The trench
was terminated short to avoid removing all of
this feature. The feature consists of what
appear to be two pits, one superimposed upon
the other, cut into the zone 8 occupation zone,
and on either side of the pits within zone 8
were in situ burned surfaces (presumably
hearths).
A third possible occupation zone consisting of
numerous Rabdotus snails, charcoal, and
burned earth.

VII. Results
Several pit features (e.g., F2, possibly F3, although this appeared to be immediately beneath the
occupation, F8, and F13) were observed in association with the occupation between 80 and
100 cmbs and most of these cut the occupation zone and were filled with darker colored earth with
inclusions of small fragments of burned earth and charcoal. Profile views of this relationship are
illustrated on Figures 44 and 45. A single pit feature was noted in association with the shallowest
occupation around 40–50 cm below datum (F12). The lowest occupation primarily consisted of a
scatter of small fragments of burned earth, charcoal and snail shells, but a single large area of
discolored (darker, presumably charcoal stained) earth with inclusions of small fragments of
burned earth and charcoal (F10) is presumably associated with this level.

A large scatter of worked and unworked mussel shell, along with carbon and faunal material, was
noted as F9. The types and association of these materials appear to indicate that F9 may be a shell
workshop. David Buzan, Atkins mussel shell expert, identified one complete shell and several pieces
of cut shell from Trench 12.3 as Tampico Pearlymussel (Cyrtonaias tampicoensis) (Figures 46–48), a
species that is fairly common and widespread in the Rio Grande basin (pers. comm. with A. Burden
February 27, 2014). There were more lithic artifacts at 41HG250 than the other sites documented
during this round of survey; five flakes were observed altogether, and one was collected (Figure
49). A few pieces of bone, also from F9, were collected for further analysis as well.

During the survey phase in November 2013, one flotation sample was collected from an occupation
zone marked by a clearly visible slightly darker-colored deposit that contained small fragments of
burned earth, charcoal, three chert flakes, and Rabdotus shell between 76 and 85 cmbs in Trench
12.0. This sample was later subjected to macrobotanical analysis and ultimately submitted for AMS
dating analysis. Macrobotanical analysis revealed the sample (Flot 6) contained Acacia, Legume
(Fabracae), hardwood, carbonized botanical indeterminate, carbonized frass, and uncarbonized
insect parts (see Appendix C). Carbon dating analysis of 0.01 grams of Legume (Fabacae) revealed
the sample dates to Cal A.D. 890 to 1020 (Cal B.P. 1060 to 930) or 1080±30 years B.P. (Beta-370063),
which places it within the Late Prehistoric cultural division (possible Austin Phase or Early
Brownsville Complex) (see Appendix D).

Site 41HG250 appears to be a series of short-term prehistoric occupations located near a resaca
that were subsequently buried by flood deposits during the Late Prehistoric period. The site
displays a very high degree of integrity, although it is possible deposits were impacted by
construction of the linear borrow pit that borders the site to the south. Sites of this age within the
Rio Grande delta have rarely been investigated archeologically, and given the integrity of the site
and evidence of substantial and repeated human habitation, the research value of these deposits is
considerable. Therefore, it is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that site 41HG250 maintains
the potential to yield information important in prehistory and is recommended eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion D as well as for nomination as a SAL. Avoidance of the site by
the proposed highway construction is recommended. If avoidance is not feasible, Atkins
recommends adverse effects to the site be mitigated through research-oriented data recovery
excavations.

41HG251 (Garza Site): Site 41HG251 is a prehistoric open campsite that is approximately 80 m
east-west by 80 m north-south within the APE (Figure 50; see Appendix B, Sheet 6). The site is
located in a cultivated agricultural field on level ground near (south of) the IBWC south levee that
borders the Hackney Lake Inlet (Figure 51). The McAllen Main Canal, which runs roughly northsouth, emerges from a siphon beneath the Hackney Lake Inlet immediately west of the site. The site
lies 2.7 km (1.6 miles) northeast of the modern channel of the Rio Grande. Soils at the site are
mapped as Runn silty clay, 0–1 percent slopes. Ground surface visibility at the site at the time of
survey was 100 percent.

Six trenches were excavated at the site during the course of site delineation and recording (see
Figure 50). The site exhibits up to six stratified occupation zones (but dipping strata may make it
appear there are more occupations than are actually present) that extend from approximately
35 cmbs to roughly 120 cmbs and 12 cultural features (Tables 6 and 7; see Appendix C).
Photographs of features are provided in Figures 52–58.

The deposits here are comprised of two depositional units: a thin (<1 m thick) veneer of Late
Holocene alluvium, which rests upon a deposit containing small calcium carbonate nodules that is
inferred to be an older alluvial fill, the top of which has been eroded away (this deposit is
presumably Middle Holocene age alluvium) (Figure 59). Most of the cultural material/features are
present in the Late Holocene alluvium, and this veneer is thinnest (75 cm) in Trench 21.0 and
thickest in Trenches 21.4 and 21.1, which suggests this deposit is thinning to the east. Some
trenches (e.g., Trench 21.1) exhibited relatively clear bedding within the Late Holocene alluvium,
and these beds dip to the south and to assume the deposits are flat lying is most likely erroneous.
Hence the five presumed occupation zones noted previously may be fewer in number but actually
occur upon dipping bedding planes, so the simple use of depth below surface may make this site
appear to have more occupations that are actually present.
No durable artifacts were noted at the site, with exception of bone found within Trench 21.1 and F6
(identified as a single burned and broken deer bone) (Figure 60). The absence of durable artifacts is
overshadowed by the presence of multiple features such as pits (containing charred sediment
within, some of which included fragments of burned earth) and in situ burned surfaces (delineated
by continuous reddened reaction rims) that appear to be hearths.

During the intensive survey phase in November 2013, a sample of the fill from F2 was recovered
from Trench 21.0. This sample was later subjected to macrobotanical analysis and ultimately
submitted for AMS dating analysis. Macrobotanical analysis of the light and heavy fractions (Flot 5)
revealed the fill contained acacia, acacia/mesquite, mesquite, carbonized grass seed, uncarbonized
insect parts, and an uncarbonized hackberry seed (see Appendix D). Carbon dating analysis of
0.09 grams of charred Acacia/Mesquite revealed the sample dates to Cal A.D. 1430 to 1480 (Cal
B.P. 520 to 470), which places it within the Late Prehistoric cultural division (possible Toyah Phase)
(see Appendix E).

Site 41HG251 appears to be a series of stratified, short-term prehistoric occupations, which were
subsequently buried by flood deposits during the Late Prehistoric period. The site displays a very
high degree of integrity. Sites of this age within the Rio Grande delta have rarely been investigated
archeologically and given the integrity of the site and evidence of substantial and repeated human
habitation, the research value of these deposits is considerable. Therefore, it is the opinion of the
Principal Investigator that site 41HG251 maintains the potential to yield information important in

nomination as a SAL. Avoidance of the site by the proposed highway construction is recommended.
If avoidance is not feasible, Atkins recommends adverse effects to the site be mitigated through
research-oriented data recovery excavations.

41HG252 (Los Tesoros Site): Site 41HG252 is a prehistoric open campsite that is approximately
60 m east-west by 65 m north-south within the APE (Figure 61; see Appendix B, Sheet 6). The site is
located in a cultivated agricultural field on level ground near (south of) the IBWC south levee that
borders the Hackney Lake Inlet (Figure 62). The site lies 2.8 km (1.7 miles) northeast of the modern
channel of the Rio Grande. Soils at the site are mapped as Runn silty clay, 0–1 percent slopes.
Ground surface visibility at the site at the time of survey was 100 percent.

Six trenches were excavated at the site during the course of site delineation and recording (see
Figure 61). Like site 41HG251, there appear to be two alluvial deposits present at 41HG252, one
that is of Late Holocene age, and a second (approximately 50–140 cmbs) that appears to be of
Middle Holocene age, the top of which has been truncated by erosion (see Appendix C). The Late
Holocene alluvium is thickest in Trench 24.1 (70 cm) and thins to the south and west (it is thinnest
in Trench 24.2 [22 cm] and 42 cm thick in Trench 24). Also like site 41HG251, 41H252 exhibits
multiple stratified occupation zones that extend from approximately 35 cmbs to roughly 130 cmbs.
The approximate stratigraphic position of some of the occupations is shown on Figure 63. Three
cultural features were revealed during trenching (Table 8). Photos of these features appear on

Figures 64–66. No artifacts were observed during trenching and although no special samples (e.g.,
flotation, radiocarbon) were collected during the initial phase of survey at the site, samples were
collected during the delineation phase of the survey.
There appears to be one occupation present at the interface between the two different alluvial
deposits and this occupation ranges widely in depth, from 37–42 cm at its shallowest, to 65–72 cm
at its thickest. This occupation contains both scatters of burned earth (Figure 67) and charcoal, but
also contains several features (F1, F2, and F3). This occupation was noted at the following depths:
65–72 cmbs in Trench 24.1 (includes F1),
47–55 cmbs in Trench 24.2 (includes F2),

37–42 cmbs in Trench 24.3 (includes F3), and

Four trenches exhibited light scatters of burned earth and charcoal within the older alluvial deposit,
but none of the trenches exposed features in association with these deeper possible occupations.
The exception to this generalization is that the cluster of burned clay balls recovered from Trench
24.0 around 120 cmbs, which may have been a feature, but the burned clay balls were not observed
in place. Approximate depths of scatters of burned earth and charcoal in the older alluvium:
121–127 cmbs in Trench 24.0,

80 and 115 cmbs in Trench 24.2,
120 cmbs in Trench 24.4, and

90–100 cmbs in Trench 24.5.

Site 41HG252 appears to be a series of short-term prehistoric occupations that were subsequently
buried by flood deposits during the Late Prehistoric and Archaic periods based on soil data. The site
displays a very high degree of integrity. Sites of this age within the Rio Grande delta have rarely
been investigated archeologically, and given the integrity of the site and evidence of substantial and
repeated human habitation, the research value of these deposits is considerable. Therefore, it is the
opinion of the Principal Investigator that site 41HG252 maintains the potential to yield information
important in prehistory and is recommended eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion D as
well as for nomination as a SAL. Avoidance of the site by the proposed highway construction is
recommended. If avoidance is not feasible, Atkins recommends adverse effects to the site be
mitigated through research-oriented data recovery excavations.

41HG253 (El Caracol Site): Site 41HG253 is a prehistoric open campsite that is approximately
50 m east-west by 50 m north-south within the APE (Figure 68; see Appendix B, Sheet 7). The site is
located in a bermudagrass hay field on level ground within the Hackney Lake Inlet, west of its
confluence with the Main Floodway (the former Sardinas Resaca) near (north of) the IBWC south
levee (Figure 69). The site lies 165 m (0.1 mile) east of the modern channel of the Rio Grande and
immediately north and west of an unnamed abandoned channel of the Rio Grande. Soils at the site
are mapped as Runn silty clay, 0–1 percent slopes. Ground surface visibility at the site at the time of
survey was zero percent.

Six trenches were excavated at the site during the course of site delineation and recording (see
Figure 68). The trenches in the middle part of the site (39.0, 39.1, 39.3, and 39.5) revealed a thick
cumulic soil that was about 80 cm thick that thins to about 50 cm in the trenches east (39.2) and
west (39.4) of the site (see Appendix C). This thick, dark colored mud is of late Holocene age.
Beneath the cumulic flood basin mud lies an incipient stage II calcic (or Bk) horizon with very small
calcium carbonate nodules that implies a middle Holocene age for this deposit.

Figure 69. Overview of 41HG253, facing east with IBWC levee in background.
Presumed cultural material, primarily burned earth, was observed in four places within the profile:
around 20 cmbs in Trenches 39.2 and 39.4;

between 70 and 80 cmbs in Trenches 39.0 and 39.3;
near 100 cmbs in Trench 39.4; and

between 118–122 cmbs in Trench 39.1.

Only one of these presumed occupations exhibited features (three identified at the site [Table 9]).
Two of the six trenches excavated at the site (39.0 and 39.3) revealed features that appear to be
prehistoric and most likely associated with a single occupation zone situated about 70 to 80 cmbs.
Figure 70 shows a north to south cross section through the site using profiles from three trenches
(39.1, 39.0, and 39.3) to illustrate the approximate stratigraphic position of the occupations
observed in these trenches. Feature 1 is a concentration of Rabdotus snail shells in a shallow basin
identified between 73 and 79 cmbs along the west wall of Trench 39.0 (Figures 71 and 72). The
shells that define the concentration are co-mingled with small (<0.5 cm) fragments of reddened
earth and formed a half-oval shape on the floor of the trench. The shell concentration consisted of
thousands of large snail shells that were stacked as much as six deep and appeared to be within a
shallow basin. Feature 2 exhibited a concentration of burned earth that suggests it either is a
thermal feature or close to one, whereas F3 is an elongate pit (Figures 73–75). The occupation zone
within these two trenches appears to lie at the interface between the cumulic soil and the Bk

horizon, and the geometry of the cumulic soil along an east-west axis suggests that the occupation
was situated within a broad shallow depression. Trench 39.1 exhibited no significant cultural
material but the occupation most likely extends to the south beyond Trench 39.3.

Trenches 39.2 and 39.4 both exposed a small number of burned clay fragments at a depth of around
20 cmbs within or near the base of the plowzone, but no concentrations were noted. The depth of
these fragments of burned clay implies a fairly young age, either Historic or slightly older.

Two other trenches exposed light scatters of burned earth and charcoal in the calcic horizon. In
Trench 39.1 a deposit of this type was noted between 118–122 cmbs, and in Trench 39.4 another
was noted around a meter below surface.

Very few artifacts were observed during trenching at site 41HG253. Although scant, lithic material
was found including one broken pebble and six microflakes (Figure 76). The microflakes were
recovered from a flotation sample (Flot 1).

Figure 76. 41HG253, Lithics from Feature 1 (microflakes from flotation) and
Feature 2 (broken pebble at center top) (FS 1 and 2).
During the survey phase in November 2013, the aforementioned flotation sample of fill from
Feature 1 was recovered. This sample was later subjected to macrobotanical analysis and
ultimately submitted for AMS dating analysis. Flotation and macrobotanical analysis revealed the
sample (Flot 1) contained flecks of hardwood, chert flakes, and shatter; uncarbonized sandmat; and
sunflower seeds (see Appendix D). Carbon dating analysis of 0.01 gram of charred hardwood
revealed the sample dates to Cal A.D. 430 to 600 (Cal B.P. 1520 to 1350) or 1530±30 years B.P. (Beta370066), which places it within the Late Archaic cultural division (see Appendix E).

is not feasible, Atkins recommends adverse effects to the site be mitigated through researchoriented data recovery excavations.

41HG254 (Jose “Ribs” Costilla Site): Site 41HG254 is a multicomponent site characterized by an
historic canal and prehistoric habitation features that is approximately 110 m east-west by 30 m
north-south within the APE (Figure 77; see Appendix B, Sheet 7). The site is located in an irrigated
bermudagrass hay field on level ground within the Hackney Lake Inlet flood channel near (north of)
the IBWC south levee (Figure 78). The site lies 213 m (0.13 mile) northwest of the modern channel
of the Rio Grande and immediately north and west of an unnamed abandoned channel of the Rio
Grande. Soils at the site are mapped as Runn silty clay, 0–1 percent slopes. Ground surface visibility
at the site at the time of survey was zero percent. A high power transmission line crosses directly
over the central portion of the site.

Five trenches were excavated at site 41HG254 during the course of site delineation and recording
(see Figure 77). The deposits at this site are similar to those at 41HG253 and consist of a silty clay
to clay A-horizon (40–70 cm thick), underlain by a calcic B-horizon with an incipient Stage II (or
nodular) morphology (see Appendix C). The core of the deposit here appears to be middle-late
Holocene age, with the A-horizon most likely deposited in the last two millennia or so.

Five cultural features were revealed during trenching (Table 10), representative of a wide range of
features and appear to indicate occupations during five discrete periods. Photographs of features
appear on Figures 79–83. The youngest features exposed (F3 and F4) are in-filled irrigation ditches
or canals that are probably the same ditch. These features originate within the plowzone (around
20 cmbs) and extend to a depth between 60 and 100 cmbs (Figure 84). Feature 3 (in Trench 40.2)
was about 5 m wide, whereas F4 (in Trench 40.3 was about 7.5 m wide). Both ditches appear to
have supported freshwater clams at one or more periods in the past (Figure 85), and based on
morphology and the presence of one cut nail and one amber glass bottle fragment (the only
artifacts collected from the site) (Figure 86) within the feature fill, likely precede construction of
the Hackney Lake Floodway around 1930.

Figure 78. Overview of 41HG254, facing southeast with IBWC levee in background.
The next oldest cultural materials observed comprise a scatter of burned earth and charcoal that
was discovered in two trenches (40.4 and 40.5) at or below the plowzone at depths between 22 and
32 cmbs. Another presumed occupation zone was noted around 50 cmbs and consisted of a scatter
of burned clay balls around 50 cmbs in Trench 40.2 and a post-like burned anomaly (F1) in Trench
40.0. Two trenches (40.0 and 40.4) exposed scatters of burned clay, charcoal and snails between
107 and 120 cmbs, and are most likely the same occupation zone. A sample of clay balls recovered
from F2 in association with this occupation surface within Trench 40.0 appears on Figure 87. The
deepest occupation observed was exposed on the floor of Trench 40.4 at a depth of 150 cmbs, and
consisted of six discrete piles of Rabdotus snail shells amid a very light scatter of burned earth
fragments. Figure 88 shows the approximate stratigraphic position of some of these occupations on
an east-west cross-section through the site using the profiles of four trench excavations (40.5, 40.4,
40.0, and 40.2).
During the survey phase in November 2013, a clay ball from F2 was subjected to carbon dating
analysis, which revealed the sample dates to Cal B.C. 2200 to 2160 (Cal B.P. 4150 to 4110)/Cal B.C.
2150 to 2030 (Cal B.P. 4100 to 3980) or 3710±30 years B.P. (Beta-370067), which places it within
the Middle Archaic cultural division (see Appendix E).

Site 41HG254 appears to be a series of short-term prehistoric occupations that were subsequently
buried by flood deposits from the Middle Archaic to Late Prehistoric periods. The irrigation ditch is
presumed to be historic in age and in use prior to formation of the floodway, after which it was in
filled. The site displays a very high degree of integrity, although it is possible deposits were
impacted by historical construction of irrigation canals within the site area. Sites of this age within
the Rio Grande delta have rarely been investigated archeologically and given the integrity of the site
and evidence of substantial and repeated human habitation, the research value of these deposits is
considerable. Therefore, it is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that site 41HG254 maintains
the potential to yield information important in prehistory and is recommended eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion D as well as for nomination as a SAL. Avoidance of the site by
the proposed highway construction is recommended. If avoidance is not feasible, Atkins
recommends adverse effects to the site be mitigated through research-oriented data recovery
excavations.

41HG255 (Cantu Site): Site 41HG255 is a prehistoric open campsite that is approximately 60 m
east-west by 75 m north-south within the APE (Figure 89; see Appendix B, Sheet 8). The site is
located at the nexus of two cultivated agricultural fields and fallow land south of the IBWC levee on
the south side of the Main Floodway (Figure 90). The site lies 4.25 miles (6.83 km) north of the
modern channel of the Rio Grande and immediately adjacent to an abandoned Rio Grande channel
that was the first major channel south of Sardinas Resaca. The site abuts a sinuous irrigation ditch
that appears to follow an ancient distributary channel of the Rio Grande that is visible on a 1936
topographic map. An east-west two-track road bisects the site. A low scarp parallels the two-track
road (Juan Balli Road) with the north side being slightly (0.5 m) higher than the south side, which is
most likely an artifact of the leveling of the agricultural fields for irrigation. Soils at the site are
mapped as Harlingen clay, 0–1 percent slopes. Ground surface visibility at the site at the time of
survey was 100 percent.
Six trenches were excavated at the site during the course of site delineation and recording (see
Figure 89). The deposits at the site consist of an A-horizon resting upon a calcic B horizon at depth.
Five cultural features were revealed during trenching (Table 11). Photos of features appear in
Figures 91–95.
Examining the depths below surface of the different features and scattered material observed, there
appear to be four distinct possible occupations exposed by the trench excavations (Figure 96, see
Appendix B). The shallowest of these lies between 35 and 45 cmbs and contains F3 (Trench 41.3)
and a scatter of burned earth, charcoal, and snail shells observed at a depth of 45 cmbs in Trench
41.4. The next occupation is represented by F4, which consists of two large charcoal fragments and
a patterned area of in situ burned earth exposed between 80 and 85 cmbs in Trench 41.3. This
feature looks structural, but it was not possible to tell with certainty.

Figure 90. Overview of 41HG255, facing west.
Two features were discovered between 105 and 120 cmbs in Trenches 41.1 and 41.3. Feature 2 was
a shallow pit containing burned earth and charcoal, and charcoal-stained earth, and F5 was a
concentration of Rabdotus shells and small fragments of burned earth exposed at a depth of 110–
115 cmbs in Trench 41.3. These two features are situated on opposite sides of the low east-west
scarp that extends through the middle of the site, and may be the same occupation, but at this time
this is not certain.
The deepest and oldest occupation (F1) was found in Trench 41.0 and consisted of a large
concentration of Rabdotus snail shells and burned clay balls exposed on the trench floor at a depth
of 130 cmbs.

During the survey phase in November 2013, two samples of feature fill were recovered from F1 for
further analysis. This sample was later subjected to macrobotanical analysis and ultimately was
submitted for AMS dating analysis. Macrobotanical analysis revealed the fill contained hardwood
flecks and carbonized frass (see Appendix D). Carbon dating analysis of one of the snail shells
revealed the sample dates to Cal B.C. 3640 to 3490 (Cal B.P. 5590 to 5440)/Cal B.C. 3470 to 3370 (Cal
B.P. 5420 to 5320) or 4730±40 years B.P. (Beta-370424), which places it within the Early Archaic
cultural division (see Appendix E).

Grande delta have rarely been investigated archeologically and given the integrity of the site and
evidence of substantial and repeated human habitation, the research value of these deposits is
considerable. Therefore, it is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that site 41HG255 maintains
the potential to yield information important in prehistory and is recommended eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion D as well as for nomination as a SAL. Avoidance of the site by
the proposed highway construction is recommended. If avoidance is not feasible, Atkins
recommends adverse effects to the site be mitigated through research-oriented data recovery
excavations.

State Highway 365 Project
Isolated Find: IFRS1 is a lithic scraper made from a river-deposited Uvalde gravel (Appendix B,
Sheet 9; Figure 97). The find was recorded in a plowed field on the ground surface. The small cobble
is approximately 7 cm long and 2–4 cm wide of reddish brown stone with many small black
inclusions. The artifact is pitted on the surface, and the bulb of percussion appears on the thin, wide
end. One edge is roughly worked. This isolate does not qualify as an archeological site and therefore
is not recommended eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for nomination as an SAL. No further
work is warranted at the location of this isolated find in association with the proposed SH 365
Project.

Section C
The total length of the previously proposed Section C of the Hidalgo Loop Project was 31 miles,
requiring up to 1,182 acres of new ROW. Prior to abandonment of the project, ROE was granted for
a total of 333 acres, and all of these areas with ROE were subjected to intensive archeological
survey between February 1 and 5, 2009. The remaining portions of the project ROW without ROE
were not surveyed (Figure 98). A total of 374 shovel tests were excavated during the survey. Survey
resulted in the documentation of four newly recorded sites (41HG226, 41HG227, 41HG228, and
41HG229) and revisits to five previously recorded sites (41HG146, 41HG147, 41HG201, 41HG203,
and 41HG204) (Appendix F). Preliminary visual reconnaissance of the previously recorded sites,
however, indicated these locations and the intervening APE are situated between two major
disturbances, an elevated irrigation canal with adjacent levee and a buried pipeline, and that the
entirety of the APE in this area appeared disturbed (Figure 99). More in-depth investigation of
these sites including shovel testing to determine the degree of disturbance was not undertaken
because the Section C Project was cancelled prior to completion of the survey investigation. Three

Figure 99. Overview of the previously proposed Section C APE near previously recorded
sites 41HG146, 41HG147, 41HG201, 41HG203, and 41HG204, facing north.
The buried pipeline appears as a maintained ROW along the left side of the frame.
isolated finds were also recorded during survey. Descriptions of each site and the isolates are
detailed below. In addition to these resources, surveyors also identified a possible cemetery, which
was later determined to be a memorial within the previously proposed Section C APE. This is also
described below.

Site 41HG146: Site 41HG146 is a prehistoric site of unknown purpose and indeterminate temporal
affiliation measuring approximately 49 x 15 m, located in a cultivated field on a flat upland area
approximately 6 km (3.7 miles) east of La Joya Creek (Appendix F, Sheet 1). Based on information
from the THC’s restricted-access Texas Archeological Sites Atlas, the site was initially recorded in
1992 by Hiede Fassler during a Phase I survey performed by 3D Environmental Services, Inc., of
Cincinnati, Ohio; however, no report reference is provided. Surface collections at the location had
recovered the following lithic materials: three bifacial thinning flakes, three unspecified reduction
flakes, and two initial reduction flakes. No subsurface cultural materials were encountered during
the initial investigation. 3D Environmental Services did not recommend the site eligible for listing
in the NRHP or for nomination as a SAL.
When Atkins’ archeologists revisited the site within the previously proposed Section C APE, they
noted that this location is between two major disturbances, an elevated irrigation canal and a
buried pipeline, and that the entirety of the APE in this area appears disturbed. Preliminary visual

reconnaissance of the location failed to identify any cultural materials associated with the site on
the ground surface, suggesting the site may have been severely degraded by erosion, mechanical
clearing, and cultivation. Further in-depth investigations of the site including shovel testing to
determine the degree of disturbance were halted, however, when the Section C Project was
cancelled and therefore a full assessment of the site could not be completed.

Site 41HG147: Site 41HG147 is a prehistoric open campsite of indeterminate age measuring
approximately 78 x 15 m, located in a cultivated field in a flat upland area approximately 6 km
(3.7 miles) east of La Joya Creek (Appendix F, Sheet 1). Based on information from the THC’s
restricted-access Texas Archeological Sites Atlas, the site was initially recorded in 1992 by Hiede
Fassler during the same Phase I survey performed by 3D Environmental Services Inc. referenced
above. Surface collections at the location had recovered the following lithic materials: one
retouched flake, five bifacial thinning flakes, one biface reduction flake, two initial reduction flakes,
three unspecified reduction flakes, one chip, and one piece of shatter. No subsurface cultural
materials were encountered during the initial investigation. 3D Environmental Services did not
recommend the site eligible for listing in the NRHP or for nomination as a SAL.

When Atkins’ archeologists revisited the site within the previously proposed Section C APE, they
noted that this location is between two major disturbances, an elevated irrigation canal and a
buried pipeline, and that the entirety of the APE in this area appears disturbed. Preliminary visual
reconnaissance of the location failed to identify any cultural materials associated with the site on
the ground surface, suggesting the site may have been severely degraded by erosion, mechanical
clearing, and cultivation. Further in-depth investigations of the site including shovel testing to
determine the degree of disturbance were halted, however, when the Section C Project was
cancelled and therefore a full assessment of the site could not be completed.

Site 41HG201: Site 41HG201 is a prehistoric open campsite of indeterminate age measuring
approximately 100 m in diameter, located in a cultivated field at a playa edge on an almost-level
plain approximately 6.4 km (4 miles) east of La Joya Creek (Appendix F, Sheet 1). The site was
initially recorded in 2006 by Terry Jones and David Brown during a Phase I survey performed by
Anthony & Brown Consulting (Brown et al. 2006). Surface inspections at the location revealed the
following materials: one Archaic triangular-shaped dart point, a light scatter of lithic debitage and
burned caliche, one mussel shell fragment, and one quartzite chunk. No subsurface cultural
materials were encountered during the initial investigation. Brown et al. (2006) did not
recommend the site eligible for listing in the NRHP or for nomination as a SAL.

clearing, and cultivation. Further in-depth investigations of the site including shovel testing to
determine the degree of disturbance were halted, however, when the Section C Project was
cancelled and therefore a full assessment of the site could not be completed.

Site 41HG203: Site 41HG203 is a prehistoric open campsite of indeterminate age measuring
approximately 120 m in diameter, located in a cultivated field at a playa edge on an almost-level
plain approximately 6.4 km (4 miles) east of La Joya Creek (Appendix F, Sheet 1). The site was
initially recorded in 2006 by Terry Jones and David Brown during the same Phase I survey
performed by Anthony & Brown Consulting referenced above (Brown et al. 2006). Surface
inspections at the location revealed the following materials: a light scatter of lithic debitage, mussel
shell fragments, burned caliche, and one partially intact unexcavated hearth of burned caliche. No
subsurface cultural materials, excluding the unexcavated hearth, were encountered during the
initial investigation. Brown et al. (2006) recommended the site potentially eligible for listing in the
NRHP and for nomination as a SAL.

When Atkins’ archeologists revisited the site within the previously proposed Section C APE, they

clearing, and cultivation. Further in-depth investigations of the site including shovel testing to
determine the degree of disturbance were halted, however, when the Section C Project was
cancelled and therefore a full assessment of the site could not be completed. .

Site 41HG204: Site 41HG204 is a prehistoric open campsite of indeterminate age measuring
approximately 80 by 120 m, located in a cultivated field on an almost-level plain approximately
6.4 km (4 miles) east of La Joya Creek (Appendix F, Sheet 1). Like sites 41HG201 and 41HG203, the
site was initially recorded in 2006 by Terry Jones and David Brown during a Phase I survey
performed by Anthony & Brown Consulting (Brown et al. 2006). Surface inspections at the location
revealed the following materials: a light scatter of lithic debitage, one mussel shell fragment, and
four burned caliche rocks. No subsurface cultural materials were encountered during the initial
investigation. Brown et al. (2006) did not recommend the site eligible for listing in the NRHP or for
nomination as a SAL.

determine the degree of disturbance were halted, however, when the Section C Project was
cancelled and therefore a full assessment of the site could not be completed.

Site 41HG226: Site 41HG226 is a newly recorded prehistoric campsite of indeterminate age
measuring approximately 20 x 85 m, located on a shoulderslope in a dense mesquite thicket
approximately 3 km (1.9 miles) north of an unnamed tributary to the Rio Grande (Appendix F,
Sheet 1; Figures 100 and 101). The site was initially located through systematic shovel testing. A
total of 13 shovel tests were excavated across the site area to determine the horizontal and vertical
extent of cultural deposits, 4 of which were positive for cultural materials yielding three pieces of
lithic debitage and one fire-cracked rock in Levels 2 and 3 (10–30 centimeters below the surface
[cmbs]).

Site 41HG226 represents at least one prehistoric occupation of unknown purpose and indeterminate temporal affiliation. The presence of lithic debitage suggests that lithic tools were produced,
utilized, and/or maintained at the site. The paucity of artifacts recovered and lack of any intact
cultural features suggest the site has either been degraded by erosion and agricultural activities or
represents a more ephemeral prehistoric activity such as retooling. Based on these results, Atkins
recommends that the investigated portion of site 41HG226 does not appear to be eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP under any criteria and is not eligible for nomination as a SAL.

Site 41HG227: Site 41HG227 is a newly recorded prehistoric campsite of indeterminate temporal
affiliation measuring approximately 30 x 90 m, located on a sideslope of a broad ridge in an
overgrown fallow field approximately 1.5 km (0.9 mile) east of an unnamed tributary to the Rio
Grande (Appendix F, Sheets 1 and 2; Figures 102 and 103). The site was initially located based upon
its surface expression, which includes a light scatter of lithic materials. An intensive surface
inspection of the site area revealed the following artifacts: one untyped projectile point fragment
(photo not available) and one piece of lithic debitage. A total of 11 shovel tests were then excavated
across the area to further determine the horizontal and vertical extent of cultural deposits, one of
which was positive for cultural materials yielding one piece of lithic debitage in Level 5 (40–
50 cmbs). Surface inspection and shovel test investigations of the site area also identified two
looting holes, one of which appears to have marginally impacted the southern end of newly
recorded site 41HG227. The first looting hole is situated adjacent to the site’s eastern boundary and
measures approximately 32 x 42 m. The second hole, measuring roughly 30 x 38 m, largely extends
south of the site; however, the looting hole’s northern edge appears to have slightly impacted the
southern terminus of site 41HG227. No cultural material was observed or recovered from within
either of the two areas of previous disturbances.

Site 41HG228: Site 41HG228 is a newly recorded prehistoric campsite of indeterminate age
measuring approximately 30 x 10 m, located on a gently rolling upland area with moderately dense
vegetation approximately 4.75 km (3.0 miles) northwest of an unnamed tributary to the Rio Grande
(Appendix F, Sheet 1; Figures 104 and 105). The site was initially located through systematic shovel
testing. A total of 12 shovel tests were excavated across the area to determine the horizontal and
vertical extent of cultural deposits, 2 of which were positive for cultural materials yielding the
following artifacts in Levels 5 and 6 (40–55 cmbs): one unidentified bone fragment, one charcoal
sample, two primary flakes, one utilized secondary flake, and two tertiary flakes.

Figure 105. Overview of site 41HG228, facing northwest.
Site 41HG228 represents at least one prehistoric occupation of unknown purpose and indeterminate temporal affiliation. The presence of lithic tools and debitage suggests that lithic tools were
produced, utilized, and/or maintained at the site. Charcoal at the site recovered from Shovel Test 9
at a depth of 45–55 cmbs accompanied by one faunal bone fragment and three heat-treated lithic
flakes may indicate an intact burned rock feature. The paucity of artifacts and additional evidence
of subsurface features, however, suggests the site has either suffered from some erosional degradation or represents a more ephemeral prehistoric activity such as retooling. Based on these results,
Atkins recommends that the eligibility of the investigated portion of site 41HG228 for inclusion in
the NRHP and for nomination as a SAL is unknown.
Site 41HG229: Site 41HG229 is a newly recorded prehistoric campsite of indeterminate age
measuring approximately 35 x 20 m, located on the edge of a flat, broad rise with short grasses in
an open field approximately 0.8 km (0.5 mile) southeast of an unnamed tributary to the Rio Grande
(Appendix F, Sheets 1 and 2; Figures 106 and 107). The site was initially located through systematic
shovel testing. A total of 10 shovel tests were excavated across the area to determine the horizontal
and vertical extent of cultural deposits, 2 of which were positive for cultural materials yielding two
secondary flakes and two tertiary flakes in Level 1 (0–10 cmbs).

Isolated Finds: Three isolated finds were recorded during survey of the previously proposed
Section C APE. Isolated Find, IFJS2, is a lithic core found on the ground surface in unknown context
(Appendix F, Sheet 1; Figure 108). Another isolated find, IFJS1, is a broken lithic biface that was
recorded on the ground surface within an open field characterized by short grasses (Appendix F,
Sheets 1 and 2; Figure 109). The third isolated find, IFRW1, is a lithic flake recorded on the ground
surface within an open field characterized by short grasses (Appendix F, Sheets 1 and 2; Figure
110). These isolates do not qualify as archeological sites and therefore are not recommended

Memorial
During the pedestrian survey, Atkins archeologists identified a fenced area approximately 10 x 10 ft
square surrounding a small wooden cross placed into the ground at a perpendicular angle along the
western edge of the previously proposed Section C APE at the north end of parcel R504492
(Appendix F, Sheet 1; Figure 111). The fence consisted of four 6-ft-tall wooden posts. The wooden
cross lacks any personal identification (e.g., name or dates), but a few small glass cups similar to
widely available glass vases containing votive candles were observed near the cross (Figure 112).
Based on this evidence, this appeared to be a possible cemetery. Although Atkins documented the
presence of the possible cemetery on February 2, 2009, the Section C Project was cancelled shortly
thereafter, and further field investigation and delineation of the site was possible. At the direction
of TxDOT ENV and the THC, on August 13, 2014, a Notice of Existence of Cemetery was filed with
the Hidalgo County Clerk’s Office in accordance with the provisions of the Texas Health and Safety
Code, Section 711.011, and a copy of the filing was also sent to the landowner, Ms. Rosalindo
Zamora (see Appendix I). On August 18, Ms. Zamora contacted Atkins Senior Archeologist Michael
Nash and informed him that the feature was erected as a memorial for her brother Roberto Zamora,
who died in a hunting accident at that location in 1972 (Zamora 2014). Ms. Zamora’s account was
confirmed by review of the Texas Death Certificate for her brother. A subsequent letter was sent to
the Hidalgo County Clerk’s Office on August 19, 2014, to clarify that the feature was not a human
burial (see Appendix I). Because the feature is not a human interment and is less than 50 years old,
no further agency coordination concerning this feature is warranted.

VIII. INTERPRETATIONS OF SH 365 EXPLORATORY TRENCHING
Between November 14, 2013 and December 9, 2013, exploratory mechanical trenching was
conducted within portions of the SH 365 APE in Hidalgo County, Texas. Trench excavations
occurred in seven areas that were identified as having a high probability of buried archeological
sites. Table 12 lists the seven areas (hereafter referred to as groups), their location, the number of
trenches that were proposed for each area, and the actual number of the trenches that were
excavated in each group. The majority of these trenches were excavated as planned, but 12 of the
proposed trenches in Group 3 were excluded from examination owing to their proposed placement
within the channel of the Hackney Lake, an oxbow lake of the Rio Grande (Figure 113).

State Highway 365 Project
Since the Emory-Salazar surveys of the lower Rio Grande established the location of the
international boundary between the United States and Mexico in the 1850s, the river has continued
to cut off meanders and create abandoned channels/oxbow lakes. This normal process of
meandering river behavior has played havoc with the international boundary and in 1884 the
International Boundary Commission was established in part to hear cases on disputed Rio Grande
channel changes and determine which country could lay claim to the territory in question (Mueller
1975:44–45). By 1905 the list of disputed abandoned channels or “bancos” that had been cut off
since the Emory-Salazar Surveys stood at 58. The Hackney Lake oxbow is shown on sheet 37 of an
1898 map by the International (Water) Boundary Commission (1903) and is not identified as one of
the 58 bancos, which means this course was abandoned prior to 1853, when the Emory-Salazar
survey were made. This map is not reproduced here as it is restricted access via the Texas Historic
Overlay Project.

The prominent geomorphic expression of this channel suggests it was recently abandoned, but
sometime prior to 1853. The USGS 1916 topographic map for Mission, Texas, shows this meander
as a U-shaped standing waterbody about 2 miles long, and in particular the northern side where the
proposed trenches were located are fully within this oxbow lake (see Figure 113). In the 1930s this
abandoned meander was converted to the departure point for a floodway that was designed to
divert high stage flow away from the modern meander belt and this project formalized a natural
process that was noted on the 1898 International Boundary Commission map as “water leaves here
going to Arroyo Colorado.” Soon after this civil engineering work was completed, Hackney Lake is
shown on a Texas State Reclamation Department (1937) topographic map (not reproduced here as
this image is restricted) as having retreated to about one mile in length along its northern reach,
which is the same as the location of the proposed trenches. At the start of this program of
exploratory trenching, this area was inspected and in most places where these trenches were
proposed, the surface exhibited evidence of significant recent sedimentation. Considered together,
the location of these proposed trenches within a recently abandoned channel that has been the site
of significant modern deposition, the potential of these trenches to reveal any evidence of
prehistoric occupation was considered to be negligible and it was agreed, in consultation with
TxDOT, that they would not be excavated. Only 2 of the proposed 14 trenches, which were outside
of the former channel were excavated in Group 3.

In all, 50 trenches were excavated, cleaned, described, and inspected for the presence of buried
cultural material in addition to the seven excavated prior to November 2013 (see Appendix C).

Seven of these trenches revealed evidence indicative of past human habitation and were
subsequently revisited and additional trenching performed in order to aid in delineation of the
extent of the archeological sites. Most of these are buried, stratified multi-component sites and are
discussed in detail in Section VII of this report and Burden and Frederick (2014). Descriptions and
photographs of the trench excavations reported here (the non-site exploratory trench excavations)
are provided in Appendix C.

VIII. Interpretations of SH 365 Exploratory Trenching

SOILS
The exploratory trenches exposed soils associated with five of the map units defined by Jacobs
(1981): specifically the Runn Silty Clay, the Harlingen Clay, the Reynosa Silty Clay, the Benito Clay
and Arents. Table 13 lists the soil map unit exposed by each trench excavation.

The Runn Silty Clay is currently classified as a fine, mixed, superactive, hyperthermic Torrertic
Haplustepts and exhibits an Ap-A-Bk-BCk-2BCk profile (National Cooperative Soil Survey 2014a).
These soils are described as having formed in calcareous clayey sediment on nearly level stream
terraces. The soils mapped as Harlingen Clay are classified by the National Cooperative Soil Survey
(2014b) as very-fine, smectitic, hyperthermic Sodic Haplusterts. These soils are reported to have
formed within clayey sediments on level terrace surfaces, and have attributes of vertic (shrinkswell) tendencies not exhibited by the Runn Series soils. The typical pedon of the Harlingen Clay
exhibits an Ap-A-Bss-Bnss1-Bnss2 profile. Reynosa Silty Clay Loam, is similar to the Runn Series
except the soils are formed within loamy sediments. The National Cooperative Soil Survey (2014c)
classifies the soils of this series as fine-silty, mixed, active, hyperthermic Torrifluventic Haplustepts
and describes the typical pedon as having an Ap-A-Bk-BC profile.

The soils mapped as the Benito Clay are classified by the National Cooperative Soil Survey (2014d)
as very-fine, smectitic, hyperthermic Sodic Haplusterts and differ from the Runn and Harlingen
series soils on the basis of accumulations of salts, specifically exchangeable sodium and salts more
soluble than gypsum. The typical profile exhibits an Az-Anz-ACnz-2CKnz profile. Soils mapped as
Arents by Jacobs (1981:15) are areas that were once low spots that have been filled by land leveling
for irrigation.

STRATIGRAPHIC OBSERVATIONS FROM THE TRENCH EXCAVATIONS

As described previously in the geologic background, the majority of the route of the SH 365 APE
traverses the first terrace of the Rio Grande, which lies between the modern floodplain and the
southern edge of the outcrop of the Pleistocene Beaumont Formation. On the western end of the
SH 365 APE the first terrace is about 3.5 km wide, and at the eastern end of the SH 365 APE the first
terrace is almost 8 km wide.

Atkins 100020726/140023

163

State Highway 365 Project
This constructive deltaic surface stands about 4 m above the modern floodplain and exhibits a
myriad of ancient fluvial geomorphic features (abandoned channels, scroll bars, etc.). Although
modern topographic maps and aerial photos somewhat convey this impression, nearly a century of
land leveling for irrigation agriculture has erased or subdued the visibility of many of these ancient
channel traces. The extent of this change can be gauged by comparing the 1936 plane table
topographic maps made by the Texas State Reclamation Department with the modern topographic
maps. Numerous, relatively continuous ancient channel courses are present on the first terrace,
trending from west north west to the east south east, and these ancient channels often flow from
one to another. The larger and more continuous ones are named (e.g., Sardinas Resaca, La Cruz
Resaca, Arroyo Colorado) but there are far many more unnamed segments. Unfortunately, there is
little known about when these different channels were active, with the only detailed dates coming
from the distal end of the delta near Laguna Madre. Fulton (1976:233; 17–18) worked with cores
collected from the east end of the subaerial delta in Texas and identified two lobes (named De la
Gringa and Southern) that, on the basis of radiocarbon dating of wood collected from depths
ranging between 37 and 65 ft below surface, appear to have been active around 5,000 and
7,000 years ago, respectively.

Although today the first terrace is rarely flooded, in years past, the Rio Grande would routinely
break out of its banks as far upstream as Penitas and inundate all of the land south of a low ridge
known as the Mission Ridge, upon which the towns of Mission, McAllen, Pharr, and Donna are built
(Trowbridge 1932:25). The Mission Ridge is underlain by the Beaumont Formation. Flood
abatement work in the 1930s began formally routing floodwater into a series of floodways
bordered by artificial levees that follow the course of some of the larger ancient Rio Grande channel
courses. The proposed route of SH 365 first follows the edge of the modern floodplain and then
diverges to follow fairly closely one of these floodways, now called the Hackney Lake Inlet.
The western end of the proposed route of SH 365, from its beginning southwest of Madero,
eastward to South 23rd Street, follows the northern edge of the modern Rio Grande floodplain, but
east of South 23rd Street the proposed ROW diverges from the modern floodplain and follows the
Hackney Lake Inlet. As might be expected, the deposits observed within the ROW reflect this broad
division in the path of the road.

In general terms, most of the trench excavations exposed two natural deposits: (1) a Late Holocene
Alluvium, and (2) a Middle-Late Holocene Alluvium. The Late Holocene Alluvium was most clearly
present in the trenches of Groups 1 to 4 where it was often separated from the Middle-Late
Holocene Alluvium by a pronounced unconformity. To the east of the Group 4 trenches, Late
Holocene Alluvium is most likely present but it is much less easy to distinguish owing to the slower
sedimentation rate and more distal depositional setting. In addition to these two major Rio Grande
deposits, the exploratory trenching revealed small amounts of Modern Alluvium (including places
where modern alluvium has formed within excavated depressions as ponds following flood events),
Introduced Fill, and even a small fragment of a deposit that is thought to be Pleistocene age

Modern Alluvium
Alluvial sediments deposited within the twentieth century are here termed “Modern Alluvium”.
These deposits are readily identified where they bury Introduced Fill. This was most common
within the Hackney Lake Inlet Floodway and these deposits range from channel-like sands to slack
water muds. The Modern Alluvial sediments generally exhibited pronounced bedding and abrupt
interfaces, often exhibited sedimentary structures (most commonly horizontal laminations), and
generally were little altered by soil development. The uppermost deposit exhibited a very slight
organic enrichment, and at depth several of the deposits contained small amounts of pedogenic
gypsum in the form of threads. The fine-grained deposits (clay and silty clay) ranged in color from
dark gray (10YR 4/1 and 7.5YR 4/1) to gray (10YR 5/1), and generally became lighter colored as
the texture coarsened. The coarsest deposits in this group were grayish brown (10YR 5/2) and light
brown (7.5YR 6/3) sands.

Two trenches (Trenches 36 and 37) (see Figure 5, Sheet 7) were situated on the floor of a modern
borrow pit within the Hackney Inlet floodway, and the modern alluvium exposed here clearly
reflected a pond-like depositional environment. These deposits were comprised of alternating thin
beds of dark gray (7.5YR 4/1, m) and brown (7.5YR 4/2, m) clay where the dark gray clays appear
to have originated from Rio Grande flows down the floodway, and the brown clays reflect erosion
and local redeposition of the Middle-Late Holocene Alluvium exposed along the margins of the
borrow pit.

Introduced Fill

Deposits identified as fill exhibited a wide range of appearance, owing to a diverse range of source
sediments. Some of these resembled modern channel deposits (pale brown [10YR 6/3] sand, and
brown [7.5YR 4/2] loamy sand) whereas others were clearly derived from ancient alluvial deposits
Atkins 100020726/140023

165

State Highway 365 Project
with well-developed rubified Stage II calcic soil horizons (reddish-brown [5YR 5/4] clay loam with
reworked calcium carbonate nodules).

Introduced Fill was most common within the Hackney Lake Inlet Floodway, near the levees that
border the floodway, or filling abandoned irrigation ditches. These deposits typically have abrupt
interfaces, often contain mixtures of two or more earthen materials and cloddy structures, and may
exhibit dramatic variation in short distances (horizontal and/or vertical). Some of the deposits have
also been compacted by heavy equipment and have extremely high bulk density, which in many
cases permitted root growth only along ped faces. Compaction, however, was not limited to
introduced fills, but was also a common attribute of in situ natural sediments beneath them.

Late Holocene Alluvium

One of the two most frequently observed deposits, the Late Holocene Alluvium, occupies the upper
half of most trench profiles. This deposit exhibited two prominent depositional facies: (1) near
channel overbank, and (2) distal overbank or flood basin.

The near channel overbank facies deposits were primarily observed in the western half of the
Group 4 trenches and most of the trenches located west of South 23rd Street (Groups 1, 2, and 3).
These deposits exhibit thin to medium beds of alternating fine and coarse sediment with colors that
ranged between 10YR and 7.5YR Munsell hues. The color of the sediment is clearly a function of the
texture with fine-grained deposits such as clays being dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) and silt loams were
generally dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) to dark brown (7.5YR 3/2). Loamy sediments ranged
from brown (7.5YR 5/3, 7.5YR 5/2) on the finer end to pale brown (10YR 5/3) and grayish-brownbrown (10YR 5/2.5) for sandy loams. Sands were generally light brown (7.5YR 6/3). Although the
alternating texture beds were clearly visible upon shaving the walls, the interfaces between
different deposits were usually blurred by the passage of small fauna and flora, which stands in
stark contrast to the modern alluvial deposits which exhibit sharp, relatively undisturbed
interfaces. Coarser textured beds (sands, sandy loams and some loams) exhibited trace evidence of
sedimentary structures, but like the interfaces, most bedding had been obliterated or significantly
blurred by post-depositional processes. The deposits of the near channel overbank facies generally
exhibited Ap-C or AC-C soil profiles with only minor evidence of pedogenic alteration in the form of
minor organic enrichment and structure development.

West of the Group 4, the base of the Late Holocene Alluvium was a clearly visible erosional
interface, but as trenching progresses eastward and the texture of the Late Holocene Alluvium
gradually became finer, the basal interface became increasingly more difficult to discern. The
trenches in the eastern half of Group 4 and all those to the east (Groups 5, 6, and 7) were deposited
in a distal overbank or flood basin setting. These massive muds exhibited no evidence of
sedimentary structures, and an Ap-AB-Bw soil had formed within the deposit. In most places these
muds appear to conformably rest upon the Stage II calcic horizon formed in the Middle-Late
Atkins 100020726/140023

166

VIII. Interpretations of SH 365 Exploratory Trenching
Holocene Alluvium, and it is reasonable to interpret them as a cumulic soil. Only in a few places, like
site 41HG252 (Los Tesoros Site) was there a hint that an erosional surface might be present
between these deposits, and this was in the form of a single occupation that occurred at the
interface between the two deposits at variable depths below the surface.

In general terms, the A horizon formed in the flood basin facies of the Late Holocene Alluvium was a
dark gray (7.5YR 3/1) to brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay, whereas the AB horizon beneath it was usually a
dark brown-brown (7.5YR 3.5/2) silty clay to clay or dark gray (7.5YR 4/1) silt loam. Where a
cambic B (or Bw) horizon was present, the deposit was usually a brown (7.5YR 4/3) silty clay or
clay.

The majority of the prehistoric occupations we observed were found within the near channel facies
of the Late Holocene Alluvium, and the distinct bedding of these deposits generally facilitated
observation of cultural features such as pits and hearths. Four radiocarbon ages were obtained for
this deposit (Table 15); two dates were obtained from charcoal collected from buried cultural
features, and two were obtained from charcoal scattered within discrete buried occupation zones.
These radiocarbon ages indicate deposition of the Late Holocene Alluvium began around 1500
years B.P. and continued through 400 years ago, and may have been ongoing when modern civil
engineering works stopped flooding of the first terrace surface by the river in the 1930s.

Middle-Late Holocene Alluvium
Across most of the SH 365 APE the oldest deposit routinely encountered was a massive mud within
which a Stage II (or nodular) calcic B-horizon had formed. This Bk horizon was usually some shade
of 7.5YR hue with brown (7.5YR 4/2, 7.5YR 5/3, 7.5YR 4.5/3, 7.5YR 5/4) or dark brown (7.5YR 3/4,
m) the most common. The texture of this deposit generally ranged from clay, to silty clay, to silt
loam. The top of this deposit was generally deeper than 45 cm and its upper interface became
deeper to the west, where it appears to have been eroded prior to deposition of the Late Holocene
Alluvium. A few exposures (e.g., Trenches 22 and 49) (see Figure 5, Sheets 6 and 8) exhibited a
buried A-horizon at the interface between the two deposits, but this was rare. Where present, this
buried topsoil was a very dark gray (7.5YR 4/1) silty clay to a very dark grayish-brown (10YR 3/2)
clay. The calcic B horizon exposed by most trenches (which were less than 1.3 m deep) was weakly
expressed, and consisted of few to common (1–3 percent) fine to medium (2–5 mm) small calcium
carbonate nodules and a few calcium carbonate filaments. But where a deeper trench was
excavated into this deposit, as at Trench 19 (see Figure 5, Sheet 6), the Bk horizon below a meter
contained more and larger (common [5–10 percent] coarse [5-15 mm] white [7.5YR 8/1] irregular)
calcium carbonate nodules.
The age of the Middle-Late Holocene Alluvium was assessed on the basis of two radiocarbon ages,
one on bulk organic matter in a burnt clay ball from Feature 2 in Trench 40.0, and a second on a
Rabdotus snail shell collected from F1 in Trench 41.0 (see Table 15). These two assays place
deposition of the upper part of this alluvial deposit between approximately 3700 and 4700
radiocarbon years B.P. They also imply a 2000 year gap in sedimentation may exist between
deposition of the Middle-Late Holocene alluvium and the Late Holocene alluvium between
approximately 3700 and 1500 years B.P.

Late Pleistocene Alluvium

Only one trench (Trench 17) exposed deposits consistent with a Pleistocene age alluvial deposit,
specifically a prominent red (5YR) color and a calcic B horizon with calcium carbonate nodules
greater than 1 cm in diameter. This ancient alluvial deposit was clearly truncated by erosion and
overlain by Introduced Fill and Modern Alluvium.

Although Pleistocene alluvial deposits are uncommon in the near surface environment in the
portion of the delta traversed by the SH 365 APE, there are at least two prominent erosional
remnants in the area: La Lomita and the core of old Reynosa. La Lomita, as the name implies, is a
discrete hill that stands about 6 m above the adjacent delta, and lies at the boundary between the
first terrace and the modern floodplain of the Rio Grande. The Bureau of Economic Geology (1976)
maps La Lomita as an outlier of the Goliad Formation. Sheet 36 of the 1898 International (Water)
Boundary Commission (1903) survey shows that the core of Reynosa is situated on a similar rise
that stands about 10 m above the surface of the first terrace. These two small hills in the center of

VIII. Interpretations of SH 365 Exploratory Trenching
the valley make it clear that prior to deposition of the first terrace, the Rio Grande eroded
Pleistocene or older sediments, and it is likely that this erosional surface has some topographic
variability, and if our trenching had been deeper, these deposits may have been seen more often.

Discussion

Although several studies exist of the submerged Rio Grande delta in the Gulf of Mexico (e.g.,
Banfield and Anderson 2004; Banfield 1998) the age and stratigraphy of the subaerial portion of
the Rio Grande delta is relatively poorly known. Large-scale mapping by Trowbridge (1923; 1932)
and subsequently by the Bureau of Economic Geology (1976) provide broad impressions of the
delta but lack geographic and chronometric specificity for the Holocene deposits.

Detailed studies of the subaerial delta sediments at depth such as Fulton (1976) are rare. The most
useful field observations for the upper end of the delta are known from contract archeological
projects (e.g., King and Frederick 2007; Brown et al. 2003; Ringstaff et al. 2003; Cooper et al. 2003;
Gallison et al. 2011, Hester 2004b), but few of these provide more than field descriptions of
backhoe trench exposures and most are quite shallow investigations (generally <2 m). One in
particular, King and Frederick (2007), was done close to this project and bears mention. Trench
observations made by King and Frederick (2007) identified three different age alluvial deposits
between the Hackney Lake Inlet and immediately east of Hidalgo: Modern alluvium, Late Holocene
Alluvium and Middle Holocene Alluvium, and these compare favorably with the observations made
during this project.
Studies that combine field observations with radiocarbon dates on charcoal or optically stimulated
luminescence (OSL) dates on sediment are particularly uncommon with only three known (e.g.,
Ringstaff et al. 2003; Gallison et al. 2011, and Cooper et al. 2003). Gallison et al. (2011) is perhaps
the most useful, but only one of the excavated sites is considered here (41HG218). Gallison et al.
(2011) also excavated site 41SR392 but this site is located within the incised valley of the Rio
Grande considerably upstream of the delta and is somewhat difficult to compare (on the basis of
geomorphology and stratigraphy) to sites on the delta proper.

RESULTS OF EXCAVATIONS AT 41HG184 (RINGSTAFF ET AL. 2003)

Excavations at 41HG184, located a short distance north of this western end of the SH 365 APE,
provide one of the few radiocarbon dated localities on the upper delta. This site is situated close to
the northern side of the first terrace. Here, Ringstaff et al. (2003) identified three alluvial
depositional units they named I, II, and III.

The oldest deposit observed, Unit I, was observed at depths greater than a meter and remains
undated, but exhibited a Stage II calcic horizon and was interpreted as having been deposited in the
Late Pleistocene or Early Holocene. Deposits associated with Unit I were generally strong brown

Atkins 100020726/140023

169

State Highway 365 Project
(7.5YR 5/6) to brown (7.5YR 5/4) and common calcium carbonate nodules greater than 1 cm in
diameter.

Unit II was separated from Unit I by a disconformity and was clearly denoted in the field by an ABw soil formed within the deposit. This stratigraphic unit was present between approximately 40
and 90 cmbs, and a single radiocarbon age was obtained from charcoal collected from 70–80 cmbs,
which yielded an age of 4800±40 years B.P. (Beta 177502). The deposits associated with Unit II
were generally brown (7.5YR 4/3) and occasionally exhibited calcium carbonate filaments.

Stratigraphic Unit III occupied the upper 50 to 75 cm of the profile and an A-Bw soil profile was
noted to have formed within this deposit. Temporally diagnostic artifacts collected from this
deposit (an undiagnostic arrow point was recovered from 10–20 cmbs and three Matamoros dart
points were recovered from 30–50 cmbs) as well as a radiocarbon age obtained from charcoal
collected from a feature near the base of the deposit (3520±40 years BP at 50–60 cmbs; Beta
178736) place deposition of Unit III in the Late Holocene. The A horizon formed within
Stratigraphic Unit III was generally a very dark grayish-brown (10YR 3/2) silty clay loam to brown
(10YR 4/2) silt loam and the B horizon was generally a brown (10YR 4/3) to yellowish-brown
(10YR 5/4) silt loam.
Stratigraphic Unit II appears to be the same as the Middle-Late Holocene alluvium identified in the
exploratory trenches reported here, but the degree of calcic horizon development appears to be less
pronounced. Stratigraphic Unit III appears to be correlative with the Late Holocene Alluvium
observed in the exploratory trenches reported here, but the radiocarbon age reported by Ringstaff
et al. (2003) is considerably older than the oldest date we obtained.

RESULTS OF EXCAVATIONS AT 41HG218 (GALLISON ET AL. 2011)

Gallison et al. (2011) reports the results of excavations at 41HG218 near Los Ebanos, which is
situated on the leading edge of the first terrace overlooking the modern Rio Grande floodplain. Here
the first terrace rises about 6 to 7 m above the mean low water level of the Rio Grande and appears
to be comparable to the surface examined at 41HG184, as well as most of the localities examined
during the SH 365 exploratory trenching reported here. The soil described from the excavations at
this site consist of an Ap-Bk-Ck-2Bk profile, where the calcic soil horizons exhibit a Stage I
(filamentous) morphology. Gallison et al. (2011:163-173) obtained three dates from the deposits at
this site, one radiocarbon age on bulk organic matter collected from the 2Bk horizon at a depth of
155 cm, which yielded an age of 2230±40 years B.P. (Beta-252960), whereas a single aliquot OSL
age from the 2Bk horizon at a depth of 195 cm yielded an age of 3350±375 years BP (UIC-2440). A
second OSL age was obtained from a depth of 45 cm in the Ap horizon and yielded an age of
2515±210 (UIC-2441) but this date was rejected. A third OSL date from site 41HG236
approximately 600 m away collected from a 2Ckb soil horizon yielded an age of 2535±195 from a
depth of 165 cmbs.
Atkins 100020726/140023

VIII. Interpretations of SH 365 Exploratory Trenching
All of the dates reported from this site are from the 2Bk horizon, which most likely correlates with
the Middle-Late Holocene alluvium observed during the exploratory trenching of SH 365. The upper
unit is undated but younger than approximately 2200 years B.P.

In addition to the dates from site 41HG218, Gallison et al. (2011) also reports the results of four
single aliquot OSL dates obtained for sediments within the modern floodplain of the Rio Grande, all
from depths greater than 1.8 m. These ages demonstrate that sediments of the modern floodplain
are most likely <1,000 years old. Although the OSL ages obtained by Gallison et al. (2011) are
probably more accurate and closer to actual depositional ages than bulk sediment organic matter
radiocarbon ages for modern alluvium, the fact that they were derived using the single aliquot
method (rather than single grain) may indicate that they overestimate the depositional age of these
deposits. Alluvial deposits are notorious for their tendency for poor resetting the OSL signal, which
in single aliquot dates results in the dates being too old.

Finally Cooper et al., (2003) examined 60 trenches within the modern meanderbelt of the Rio
Grande and obtained 10 radiocarbon ages, only one of which was obtained from charcoal. The
majority of the dates were obtained on bulk sediment and the authors were convinced that these
ages were too old to represent depositional ages of the Rio Grande, which is consistent with
observations on the Rio Grande alluvium from West Texas (cf. discussion in King and Frederick
2007; Frederick 1993, 2004) where such dates are often 1000 years or more too old. Hence, only
the sole charcoal date obtained by Cooper et al. (2003) is considered a valid depositional age.

Discussion

The results of these three studies together provide some clarity with respect to the age and
stratigraphy of the near surface deposits of the Rio Grande floodplain and first terrace. The right
side of Figure 114 shows how the dates obtained during the exploratory trenching of SH 365
compare with previous studies in this area.

THE RIO GRANDE FLOODPLAIN

The charcoal radiocarbon date obtained by Cooper et al. (2003) and the single aliquot ages
obtained by Gallison et al. (2011) both indicate that the deposits associated with the modern
meanderbelt of the Rio Grande are young, and Gallison argues have been deposited in the last
millennium. Although there is room for improvement here (for instance by incorporating single
grain OSL dating), these ages are consistent with the appearance of the deposits situated in this
setting, suggesting that within the modern floodplain sites of the Historic and Late Prehistoric
periods may lie buried.

VIII. Interpretations of SH 365 Exploratory Trenching

THE FIRST TERRACE OF THE RIO GRANDE
The three projects on the first terrace provide information on the age of these deposits at different
points with respect to the modern meanderbelt. Site 41HG218 is located immediately adjacent to
the modern valley, whereas 41HG184 is located close to the northern margin of the first terrace.
The observations from the exploratory trenches for SH 365 range from near the modern
meanderbelt, like 41HG218, to a medial to distal overbank setting like 41GH184. All three studies
identified a relatively young deposit resting upon an older deposit at depth. The top of this older
deposit near the modern meanderbelt ranges from about 0.8 to 1.4 m and appears to be around
0.4 m in more distal overbank settings. The ages obtained from the upper deposit indicate it reflects
sedimentation in the last 1,500 years, and the date obtained from 41HG184 suggests this deposit
may be as old as 3,000 years. The radiocarbon ages obtained during this project suggest that this
deposit, the Late Holocene Alluvium, is sediment deposited by large overbank floods originating
within the modern meanderbelt of the Rio Grande. Although there is still some uncertainty about
the maximum age for these deposits, it is clear that this deposit may contain buried archeological
sites ranging in age from the Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric, and possibly as old as Middle Archaic.

The next older deposit has returned ages ranging from 2,200 years B.P. to almost 5,000 years B.P.
and suggests that it may contain buried archeological sites of Middle and Late Archaic age. The age
of the base of this deposit is currently unknown, but older than 5,000 B.P. All three studies noted
that the top of the older alluvial deposit has been truncated by erosion, so it is difficult to discern
when sedimentation of this unit ended and the deposition of the younger alluvial deposit began.
Context and Integrity of Sites

CONTEXT AND INTEGRITY OF SITES

The seven sites discovered during the exploratory trenching for this project (41HG249–41HG255)
clearly demonstrate that the deposits of the first terrace contain buried prehistoric habitation
remains with exquisite context, but these sites generally have extremely poor archeological
visibility and low artifact density. Although it is possible that such sites could be discovered
through shovel testing, most would escape detection using this survey method alone. Only one of
the seven provided produced durable artifacts in the field, whereas most simply presented as
stratigraphically discrete scatters of burnt earth, charcoal and snails, or as features. In most cases
the burnt earth observed in the trenches is in the form of small fragments (1 to 5 mm) most likely
detached from hearths during their maintenance, and subsequently scattered across the living
surface by foot traffic or rain.
The alternating fine-coarse textured deposits of the Late Holocene Alluvium in the near channel
overbank environment not only was a preferred setting for habitation, but these stratified deposits
provided interpretive clarity by highlighting shallow excavations in the forms of pits or hearths.

Such features were much more difficult to see in the more massive sediments of medial to distal
overbank depositional environments.

IX. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On behalf of the HCRMA, Atkins conducted a series of intensive linear archeological surveys for
proposed Sections A (now SH 365) and C of the Hidalgo Loop Project and the IBTC Project near
McAllen, in Hidalgo County, Texas. These projects were modified, however, after survey began with
regard to funding, extent, and name, and Section C of the Hidalgo Loop Project was terminated prior
to completion of the survey.

Approximately 1,816 total acres of accessible properties were surveyed for the three projects under
TAC Permits 5124, 5125, and 5683 between January 2009 and February 2014. A total of 1,314
shovel tests and 97 trenches were excavated for the combined projects. Fourteen new archeological
sites were recorded and seven previously recorded archeological sites were revisited as a result of
the surveys. Sites 41HG223, 41HG224, and 41HG249–41HG255 were recorded and site 41HG230
was revisited within the proposed Section A/SH 365 APE; only sites 41HG224, 41HG230, and
41HG249–41HG255 as well as one isolated find are located within the proposed SH 365 APE. One
additional previously recorded archeological site, 41HG142, was identified within the proposed
Section A APE during the records review but was not revisited during survey due to lack of ROE.
Previously recorded site 41HG30, plotted just outside the Section A/SH 365 APE, was revisited, and
no cultural materials associated with the site were found to extend into the APE. Sites 41HG226,
41HG227, 41HG228, and 41HG229 were recorded, and sites 41HG146, 41HG147, 41HG201,
41HG203, and 41HG204 were revisited within the previously proposed Section C APE. Three
isolated finds were also documented within the previously proposed Section C APE. Site 41HG237
was recorded within the proposed IBTC APE.

Based on the survey findings, Atkins recommends that sites 41HG223, 41HG224, 41HG226,
41HG227, 41HG229, 41HG230, and 41HG237 documented within the APEs of these projects are not
eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under any criteria according to 36 CFR 60.4 and are not eligible
for listing as SALs according to 13 TAC 26.12. Further, the eligibility of site 41HG228 for inclusion in
the NRHP and listing as a SAL is unknown at this time. Assessments of previously recorded sites
41HG146, 41HG147, 41HG201, 41HG203, and 41HG204 were not completed due to cancellation of
the Section C Project. If the Section C Project is revived in the future, Atkins recommends additional
survey at these sites to complete the assessments.
A possible cemetery was identified in parcel R504492 but documentation was not completed due to
cancellation of the Section C Project. Further investigation determined that it was not a cemetery
but a memorial. No further investigation is recommended. For extant proposed projects SH 365 and
IBTC, Atkins further recommends a finding of no adverse effects for sites 41HG224, 41HG230, and
41HG237, and therefore construction should be allowed to proceed in these areas.

Based on evidence recovered during the intensive survey phase, Atkins has identified seven
prehistoric archeological sites within the proposed SH 365 APE, 41HG249–41HG255. These sites
Atkins 100020726/140023

175

State Highway 365 Project
exhibit evidence of prehistoric occupation in the form of occupation zones (scatters of burned
earth, charcoal, and shell with varying degrees of density), and thermal pits evident by burn rims
and fill characterized by charcoal-stained earth, bits of charcoal, and burned earth, bone, and shell.
Evidence of historic activity at the sites was limited to a filled in irrigation canal. Radiocarbon
dating analysis as well as soil data indicate that these prehistoric occupations range in age from the
Early Archaic to the Late Prehistoric cultural divisions.

All seven of these sites are situated within overbank alluvial deposits of the Rio Grande that
postdate the middle Holocene. Sedimentation during this period, combined with repeated
occupation of the same places, led to the creation of these stratified, multicomponent sites, which
generally contain thin occupation zones separated by sterile sediment. As a result, the research
potential of these sites appears to be considerable.

Given the documented array of cultural features and evidence of stratified occupation zones, Atkins
recommends that all seven sites (41HG249–41HG255) are eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and
nomination as SALs, and that these sites should be avoided by the proposed construction. Due to
programmatic constraints and design requirements, horizontal avoidance of the sites is not feasible.
Therefore, Atkins proposes that the sites be avoided by burial to consist of depositing at least 2 m of
in-kind sterile fill dirt (i.e., clay over clay, loam over loam, sand over sand) over the areas
encompassed by site boundaries within the APE to depths to be determined in consultation with
TxDOT and the THC. If avoidance is not feasible, Atkins recommends that adverse effects to the sites
be mitigated through research-oriented data recovery excavations in advance of construction. A
mitigation plan for data recovery at the sites must be reviewed and approved by TxDOT and the
THC prior to fieldwork.

Aside from the sites and isolated finds located during the respective archeological surveys
described in this report, Atkins also concludes that a traditional survey methodology involving
shovel testing within alluvial deposits associated with this reach of the Rio Grande delta is
impractical given the clay content of soils within 1 m of the ground surface and ineffective at
locating subsurface prehistoric deposits given the lack of diagnostic or even durable artifacts and
ephemeral feature types. As such, we hope the reader considers a future survey methodology for
this area, under these conditions, that focuses on trenching within HPAs as it is far more efficient
and effective for locating prehistoric deposits in this culture area within Middle-Late Holocene
alluvium.

Re: Project review under Section 106 ofthe National Historic Preservation Act of1966 proposed International
Trade Bridge Corridor, Hidalgo County USACE/106 (THC Track #201103787)
Dear Mr. Denton:
On October 25, 2010, the Texas Historical Commission (THC) concurred with PBS&J's recommendations in the
September 16, 20 I 0 Draft Cultural Resources Survey Report and further clarified in a October 22, 20 I 0 letter, that
the proposed Hidalgo County Regional Mobility Authority (HCRMA) International Trade Bridge Corridor (IBTC)
project area in Hidalgo County, Texas be cleared to proceed from an archeological standpoint with the exception of
outstanding trench locations, inaccessible inundated parcels, and inundated Temp Site 2 location (now 41HG237). In
addition, further consultation with the THC was recommended regarding the components of the NRHP-listed
irrigation system located within the proposed IBTC right of way. The archeological investigations were
subsequently addressed in the Final Draft Cultural Resources Survey Report, which was submitted to the THC on
November 5, 2010. Consequently, THC issued their concurrence on December 2, 2010 for these additional
archeological investigations and the necessity for further consultation with regards to the NRHP-listed irrigation
system crossings.
Based on the additional archeological investigations addressed in the November 5, 2010 Final Draft report, site
41HG237 does not appear to be eligible for NRHP inclusion, the geoarchaeological trenching did not encounter any
archeological material or features, and no additional sites were recorded within the IBTC project area. PBS&J is
therefore requesting confirmation of the December 2, 2010 THC concurrence of the archeological resources survey
with the understanding that further consultation is needed for the NRHP-listed irrigation system crossings.
In conclusion, PBS&J recommends that no further archeological investigations of the proposed IBTC project area
are needed and no further consultation is required with the THC for archeological resources. However, if previously
undiscovered archeological remains are discovered during construction, work in the area will cease and the THC
will be consulted.
Once final design is complete, PBS&J will provide the treatment for the proposed road at the intersection of historic
canals and drawings showing the proposed road crossings at the applicable canals for THC's review.
Sincerely,

Project Archaeologist

ABSTRACT
On behalf of the Hidalgo County Regional Mobility Authority, PBS&J conducted an intensive linear
cultural resources survey of the proposed Hidalgo International Bridge Trade Corridor (IBTC) roadway
project south-southeast of McAllen, in Hidalgo County, Texas. The proposed undertaking will consist of
the construction of a tolled highway composed of up to six travel lanes. The roadway would extend from
US 83 Expressway (0.5 mile east of Farm-to-Market Road [FM] 1423) to U.S. Highway (US) 281
(Military Highway) at San Juan Road and to FM 493 approximately 1.5 miles north of US 281; a length
of approximately 14.7 miles (23.7 kilometers [km]). A total of 618.2 acres of new right of way (ROW)
would be required for the construction of the roadway including an additional 70.5 acres of existing
transportation ROW. Currently, the project is located on property owned and controlled by Hidalgo
County and on private property for which Hidalgo County has obtained right-of-entry. The current
archeological investigations consisted of a background literature and records review, a historic standing
structure survey, geoarcheological investigations, and an intensive pedestrian survey with shovel testing
of the accessible portions of the project area (approximately 14.1 miles [22.7 km]). The extreme western
portion of the current project falls within the limits of Section A of the original Hidalgo Loop concept
(CSJ #0921-02-172), which was investigated by PBS&J in January 2009. This portion was incorporated
into the current IBTC project area as Section A was determined not to be feasible as originally
envisioned. Therefore, this report summarizes the 2009 survey and the remaining investigations,
conducted in 2010 under Texas Antiquities Permit 5683.
The background review revealed there are no archeological sites within or immediately adjacent to the
project area and two previously conducted cultural resources surveys contained portions of the project
area. The previous surveys did not record any archeological sites within the IBTC project area. Four sites,
all historic, are located within 2,000 meters of the project area (sites 41HG158, 41HG159, 41HG160, and
41HG230). Historic archeological site 41HG230 is an Old Military Road recorded by GTI Environmental
Inc. in 2009, and has been recommended for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
and for designation as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL). The site is located approximately 450
meters south of the southwestern portion of the IBTC project area at its closest point. None of the
remaining three sites were considered eligible for NRHP nomination or warrant SAL designation.
The archeological survey of the accessible areas utilized shovel testing in areas that displayed limited
disturbance. Disturbed areas were documented and walked but not shovel tested. The pedestrian survey
recorded two new archeological sites. In the areas that were not subjected to subsurface examination,
there is little potential for buried cultural resources to be present due to the severity of previous
disturbances. The geoarcheological investigations, conducted in the high probability areas where the
vertical area of potential effect is substantially deeper than accessible by shovel testing, did not encounter
any cultural materials or features.

Abstract

In accordance with Section 106, 36 CFR 800.4, PBS&J has made a reasonable and good faith effort to
identify archeological historic properties within the surveyed portions of the project area. As no properties
were identified that meet the criteria for listing on the NRHP according to 36 CFR 60.4 or for designation
as an SAL according to 13 TAC 26.12, PBS&J recommends no further work in these areas. Furthermore,
the portions of the project area adjacent to existing roadways displayed previous disturbances that leave
little to no potential for buried cultural resources to be present. Therefore, PBS&J recommends that no
further cultural resource investigations are needed throughout the IBTC project area.

I. INTRODUCTION
On behalf of the Hidalgo County Regional Mobility Authority (HCRMA), PBS&J conducted an intensive
linear cultural resources survey of the proposed Hidalgo International Trade Bridge Corridor (IBTC)
roadway project, southwest of McAllen in Hidalgo County, Texas (Figure 1). The 14.7-mile
(23.7 kilometers [km]) project would consist of constructing a new tolled highway composed of up to six
travel lanes from US 83 Expressway (0.5 mile east of Farm-to-Market Road [FM] 1423) to U.S. Highway
(US) 281 (Military Highway) at San Juan Road and to FM 493 approximately 1.5 miles north of US 281.
A total of 618.2 acres of new right of way (ROW) with an additional 70.5 acres of existing transportation
ROW would be required for the construction of the roadway. The current archeological investigations
consisted of a background records review and an intensive pedestrian survey of the accessible portions of
the project area (approximately 14.1 miles [22.7 km]). The project is currently located on property owned
and controlled by Hidalgo County and on private property for which Hidalgo County has obtained right­
of-entry (ROE). Because the work is being funded locally by the HCRMA and no federal funds are
involved, the investigations were conducted in compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) in
accordance with the Texas Historical Commission (THC) and Council of Texas Archeologist (CTA)
standards. In areas adjacent to jurisdictional waterways of the United States, the investigations were
conducted in fulfillment of an anticipated United States Army Corp of Engineers (USACE) Section 404
permit in accordance with the guidelines set out under 36 CFR 800 for Section 106 compliance under the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). In addition, due to the USACE Section 404 permit, the
evaluation of historic properties was conducted pursuant to 36 CFR 60 of the NHPA and 13 TAC 26 of
the ACT in accordance with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Identification, Evaluation and
Documentation (48 Federal Register Parts 4471 6–42) of historic resources. The current report provides a
definition of the study area, the environmental background and cultural history of the region, the methods
and results of the investigations, and a summary of the investigations with recommendations on further
research.
The goals of the current investigations were to locate all prehistoric and historic archeological sites and
historic structures in the accessible portions of the area of potential effect (APE), determine the
probability of archeological deposits in the inaccessible portions of the APE, establish vertical and
horizontal site boundaries as appropriate with respect to the APE, and evaluate the significance and
eligibility of recorded sites and structures for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
and/or designation as State Archeological Landmarks (SAL). The background records review included
archival research for both archeological resources and historic-aged non-archeological resources
previously identified within and in the vicinity of the project area. The intensive archeological survey
consisted of shovel testing and the examination of available surface and subsurface exposures in
determining the presence of archeological deposits. In addition, geoarcheolgical mechanical trenching
was conducted in the high probability areas where the vertical APE is substantially deeper than accessible
by shovel testing, such as the location of proposed overpasses and pilings. Furthermore, project historians

I: Introduction

conducted a historic standing structure survey, which documented and evaluated all historic-aged (pre­
1960) resources (buildings, structures, objects, districts, etc.) within the IBTC APE. Due to one parcel
with no ROE in the project area, about 677.7 acres of the roughly 688.7 total acres of the project area
were investigated by the archeological survey. This equates to approximately 14.1 linear miles (22.7 km)
(96 percent) of the 14.7-mile (23.7 km)-long APE. Issues encountered during the cultural resource survey
included modern development disturbances, flooding of low-lying areas near irrigation canals due to
heavy rains, and a nonrelated water project within the northern portion of the ROW.
The western portion of the current project falls within the limits of Section A of the original Hidalgo Loop
concept (CSJ #0921-02-172), which was previously survey by PBS&J in 2009 (Figure 2). Therefore, the
intensive archeological survey referenced in this report was conducted on January 15–30, 2009, and July
20–26, August 2–5, and October 18–21, 2010. A background of the original project in relation to the
current project is provided in the Section A/Hidalgo Loop Investigations section below. Personnel on the
2009 intensive archeological survey consisted of Ryan Schuerman, Matt Basham, Erin French, Erin
Watkins, and Rae Wehr, with Julie Shipp serving as Project Archeologist. The 2010 survey was
conducted by Walker Van Item, Dawn Riggs, and Katrina Miller, with Robert Rowe and Julie Shipp
serving as Project Archeologists. The 2009 and 2010 surveys were both under the direction of Principal
Investigator Robert Rogers. No artifacts were collected during the surveys, and all notes, drawings, daily
journals, site record forms, photographs, and other documentation will be curated at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) at the J.J. “Jake” Pickle Research Campus, University of
Texas at Austin.

SECTION A/HIDALGO LOOP INVESTIGATIONS
The current IBTC project contains portions of Section A and B of the originally envisioned Hidalgo
Loop. The original Section A called for the construction of a new tolled highway composed of up to six
travel lanes running from US 281, east of the Pharr International Bridge, to the existing US 83, north of
and parallel to the Rio Grande for an approximate distance of 19 miles (30.6 km). PBS&J submitted a
research design to Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Environmental Affairs Division staff,
which was subsequently approved, and conducted an intensive pedestrian survey of portions of the
Hidalgo Loop Section A project in early 2009. This included the portion of the current IBTC project from
the intersection of US 281 (Military Highway) at San Juan Road to Dicker Road (FM 3072), which is
completely within the original Section A ROW (see Figure 2). The original Hidalgo Loop was determined
not to be feasible as originally envisioned. However, problems and needs still exist in the area related to
border-crossing traffic on the local street network and connectivity to the freeway system and local freight
facilities. Therefore, in a need to address these problems and to meet the related transportation needs, the
HCRMA is moving forward with three projects: the Trade Corridor Connector (TCC) project, the US 83
Connector project, and the current IBTC project. The TCC and US 83 Connector projects will use federal
funding; however, the IBTC project will be completed without using federal funds.

I: Introduction

Because the portion of the current IBTC project from US 281 (Military Highway) to FM 3072 was
previously investigated during original survey of the Section A, PBS&J used the original survey data for
this portion of the current IBTC project. The previous survey resulted in the recording of one historic
archeological site (41HG224) in the IBTC project area, which is described further in the results of the
archeological survey section.

PROJECT APE DESCRIPTION
As proposed, the current IBTC APE corresponds with the proposed ROW, which will range in width
from 160 to 300 feet (ft) (49–91 meters [m]), expanding to 400 ft (122 m) at identified overpass locations.
The vertical APE will be a function of the profile and drainage needs and will not be consistent
throughout. In general, the vertical APE will be 39.5 inches (1 m). Where overpasses will be constructed,
an additional 2 ft (60 centimeters [cm]) may be necessary for retaining walls or mechanically stabilized
earth. In areas where pilings are necessary, the vertical APE will be approximately 70 ft (21.3 m). It is
anticipated that all construction easements will be within the proposed ROW. Overall, the project APE
consists of 688.7 acres with a maximum depth of 3 ft (0.9 m) (aside from isolated piling locations).

II. DEFINITION OF THE STUDY AREA
Located just southwest and outside of the city limits of McAllen, Texas, the IBTC project area is located
in the Lower Rio Grande Valley of south Texas. Topographically, the area is within the floodplain and
delta alluvial deposits of the Rio Grande and contains many oxbow lakes, or resacas, formed from ancient
meanders of the river. The natural waterways throughout the area have been either modified or diverted to
a series of man-made canals. The project area itself crosses the Donna Main Canal, Donna Reservoir, nine
elevated canals, six altered waterways, and La Cruz Resaca with the associated International Boundary
and Water Commission’s Main Floodway (Main Floodway). Overall, the project area is located in a
mostly rural environment, with more of an urban setting along existing roadways consisting of residences,
commercial fronts, fields, and farmhouses (figures 3 and 4). Utilities, both aboveground and buried, are
located adjacent to or within the ROW, and runoff ditches are present in some areas.

III. ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
The following section provides an overview of the physical setting of the region relevant to the current
investigation including the natural setting, geology, soils, flora, and fauna.

NATURAL SETTING
Several sources can be cited for describing the natural setting of any area of Texas. Some of the most
popular descriptors for natural settings are biotic provinces, ecological regions, and ecoregions. These
areas can be further subdivided depending on the source of reference. For instance, the IBTC project area
lies within a) the Matamoran District of the Tamaulipan Biotic Province (Blair 1950), b) the South Texas
Plains Ecological Region (Blair 1950; Gould 1969), and c) the Lower Rio Grande Alluvial Floodplain
portion of the Western Gulf Coast Plain ecoregion (Griffith et al. 2004). Biotic province refers to an area
with a similar community of floral and faunal associations based on physiographic characteristics and soil
type, as well as climate (Presley 2003). Ecological regions are largely based on an attempt to standardize
the taxonomic accounts of vascular plants in Texas, which rely heavily on vegetation types and dominant
plant species, as well as soils and current land uses (Gould 1975; Hatch et al. 1990). Finally, ecoregions
refer to areas of similar biotic and abiotic phenomena such as geology, physiography, vegetation, climate,
soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology (Griffith et al. 2004). Due to the ecoregion definition providing a
more concise depiction of the natural setting of the IBTC project area, the Griffith et al. (2004)
description of the Lower Rio Grande Alluvial Floodplain portion of the Western Gulf Coast Plain
ecoregion is used for this report.
The Western Gulf Coast Plain maintains a relatively flat topography with predominantly grassland
vegetation adjacent to the coast. Moving inland, the region’s plains are older, more irregular, and have
mostly forest or savanna-type vegetation. The Lower Rio Grande Alluvial Floodplain portion of the
ecoregion predominantly consists of Holocene-aged alluvial sands and clays of the Rio Grande.
Historically, the floodplain ridges once had abundant palm trees, and early Spanish explorers called the
river “Rio de las Palmas” (Griffith et al. 2004). However, most large palm trees and floodplain forests had
been cleared by the early 1900s. Currently, the region is dominated by cropland with rice, grain sorghum,
cotton, and soybeans as the principal crops. In addition, urban and industrial land uses have expanded
greatly in recent decades, and oil and gas production is common. Channels for irrigation and urban use
have mostly diverted the waters of the Rio Grande with little or no flow reaching the Gulf of Mexico.
Elevations throughout the region range from sea level to approximately 100 ft (30 m) above mean sea
level (amsl). Average annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 35 inches (40 to 89 cm), occurring mostly in
the spring and fall. Summers are often characterized by drought conditions that are frequently of
sufficient duration to depress crop growth.

III: Environmental Background

GEOLOGY
The current Lower Rio Grande Valley is a mix of riverbank, shore, marsh, and lake settings with the
amalgamation of silty and sandy flat floodplain giving rise to shifting stream channels. This system of
altered steam channels result in the resacas and oxbows and meander scars that are found throughout the
region. These structures are perpetually affected by wind-borne sediments (Butzer 1982).
Since the last glacial maximum (ca. 20,000 B.P.), the river valley has changed dramatically. Ocean levels
had risen approximately 100 m causing the course of the Rio Grande to shorten with the influx of the
rising sea water, which caused an increase in valley aggregation (Brown et al. 1980). After the last glacial
maximum by the middle of the Holocene, the Rio Grande was depositing alluvial soils and ultimately
flooding the valley several times (Boyd et al. 1994). These flooding episodes created an estuarine
environment (Brown et al. 1980). The filling of the valley ceased between 10,000 and 7000 B.P., resulting
in additional soil aggregation manifested as prograding delta lobes over earlier Holocene deposits. Sea
level reached its present level at around 3000 B.P., and due to the rising water the lobes were reworked,
eroded away, and redeposited.
The geology of the Lower Rio Grande Valley consists of Holocene (>10,000 years), Pleistocene (10,000–
2 million years [my]), and Pliocene (12.5–4.5 my) fluvial and deltaic deposits (Brown et al. 1980).
Multiple high, level Pleistocene terraces border the Holocene floodplain and delta complex. These
terraces were formed by fluvial-deltaic deposition during maximum sea level periods and under glacial
minimum conditions during the middle to late Pleistocene (Paine 2000). Overlying the terraces are
extensive windblown deposits of sand and clay dunes, interspersed with sand sheets and localized wind
deflation areas. Holocene stabilized sand dunes occur as broad, segmented expanses of northwestwardtrending eolian deposits (Mallouf et al. 1977:9–10). These deposits usually have a height of 1 to 9 m. The
surface relief of the stabilized sand dunes is typically undulating with occasional eolian depressions of
varying size and shape (Mallouf et al. 1977:9–10). Because of the active nature of these windblown
deposits, archeological sites may be repeatedly buried and eroded. In addition, the depressions that can
occur in them possess the capability of retaining water for a limited time after rains and, given the
importance of water in the arid landscape, would have been attractive to prehistoric animals and people.
The oldest bedrock deposit within the project area is the Pliocene epoch Goliad Formation (12.5–4.5 my).
It is exposed in central and southwestern Hidalgo County, and manifested as fluvial deposits composed of
clay, sand, sandstone, caliche, chert, limestone, and dark siliceous granules and pebbles in a caliche
matrix (Brown et al. 1980). This formation is the source of much of the locally obtained raw materials
used for prehistoric stone tools within the region (Bousman et al. 1990).
The Lissie Formation overlays the eastern edge of the Goliad Formation as an unconformity in central
Hidalgo County. The formation was deposited during the Oligocene into the middle Pleistocene and
ended at 14,000 B.P. and included at least 14 continental glacial advances interspersed by warmer periods
(Day et al. 1981). The Lissie Formation consists of gray to brown to pale yellow clay, silt, sand, siliceous

100011499/100154

III: Environmental Background

gravel, and sandy caliche. Pockets of stabilized sand dune deposits characterized by dense live oak copses
and scrub vegetation occur within the formation (Brown et al. 1980).
Within southern Hidalgo County is the Beaumont Formation of the Late Pleistocene, which is exposed as
matrices of clay, silt, sand, and gravel to a depth to 270 m. The sediments composing the Beaumont
Formation were primarily deposited by rivers, and include natural levees and deltas that coalesced
through shifting of the river mouths as they reached the coast. The marine element of the formation is
much less pronounced, and included marine and lagoonal waters in the embayments between the stream
ridges and delta plains (Sellards et al. 1966). Archeologically, the age of these deposits precludes the
presence of deeply buried sites, but may contain megafaunal remains.
There are currently three major physical divisions of the project area: meanderbelt deposits, flood basin
deposits, and terrace deposits. Within the active and Holocene floodplains are the meanderbelt deposits
and flood basin deposits, which are bordered by the terrace deposits of the old Rio Grande system. The
meanderbelt deposits contain primarily point bar deposits formed by active river migration. These
deposits are typically composed of coarse-grained materials and include channel-type depositional
environments (i.e., abandoned channels, courses, crevasse channels, and other minor short-lived river
channels).
Adjacent to the active meanderbelt deposits are the flood basin deposits. As the name implies, finegrained sediments are transported and deposited to the lowest and distal positions of the floodplain during
high-water events to form these deposits. Flood basin deposits are composed primarily of clay, and they
are generally represented by the Hidalgo and Harlingen soil series from the U.S. Department of
Agriculture (USDA) soil maps. These soils were also used to construct large portions of the levees in the
area and are exposed in the smaller unlined ditches and drains. They also make up most of the agricultural
soils within the project area. Also present in the flood basin deposits are abandoned Holocene Rio Grande
meanderbelts and La Cruz Resaca.
The late Pleistocene terrace deposits border the active floodplain along the northern edge of the project
area and are built on early to middle Pleistocene terraces and associated soils. The terraces contain the
same suite of deposited environments that is present on the modern and Holocene floodplains. Terrace
deposits contain older channels and courses of the Rio Grande, which flowed at a higher elevation than in
the present-day system. Holocene and Pleistocene windblown deposits veneer the terrace surfaces,
making interpretation of the abandoned channels and courses of the older system difficult in photography
and imagery. Additional, significant urban development and large-scale agricultural activities in the
Lower Rio Grande Valley have altered much of the original fabric of the floodplain.
Currently the area is in a destructional phase. Sea level rise, negligible river flow by the Rio Grande to the
Gulf of Mexico because of increased irrigation, construction of major main-stem dams, and
corresponding lack of river-transported sediment as well as frequent storm surges have produced an
erosional shoreline in the Lower Rio Grande Valley.

III: Environmental Background

SOILS
It is important to understand the sedimentation and the soil-development sequence in the interpretation of
site formation processes. Soil formation on alluvial terraces is usually quite different from that on
floodplains. The number of soils in a stratigraphic sequence and their degree of development can be
important in assessing the duration and integrity of the archeological record at an alluvial site.
Soil scientists have developed an extensive nomenclature of soil types. Identification of the current soils
and reconstruction of past soils within the project area are essential for grasping the nature and extent of
early activities and inferring past environmental and climatic conditions. The soils of four soil series have
been mapped along the IBTC from USDA soil maps of the area. These soils can be grouped into three soil
orders: Vertisols, Mollisols, and Inceptisols.
Vertisols usually consist of dark clay soils or soils with high clay content. Vertisols shrink and swell,
often in accordance with seasonal variations in moisture. The clay consists primarily of expansive clays,
such as montmorillonite, that form deep, wide desiccation cracks during the drier seasons, which
produces a hummock-and-swale topography with a subsurface expression of mixed soils. Alternating
shrinking and swelling results in mixing and creates a thick A horizon (Rapp and Hill 1998). Soils of the
Harlingen and Benito series are Vertisols found in the IBTC (Jacobs 1981). Harlingen soils occur over
approximately 85 percent of the IBTC project area. They are very deep, moderately well-drained, and
very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey sediments. They occur on nearly level stream terraces.
In a typical soil profile, they have a horizon sequence consisting of Ap-A-Bss-Bss1-Bss2. Benito soils are
deep, poorly drained, and very slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous alluvial sediments. They
occur on nearly level terraces and have a typical horizon sequence of Az-ACnz-2CKnz. Benito soils are
confined to a small percentage of the IBTC.
Mollisols are soils that formed under grasslands vegetation. They are typically dark in color as a result of
the accumulation of organic matter. They are also base-rich and usually have a mollic epipedon, which is
a soil surface horizon characterized by a dark color, fine structure, a minimum of 1 percent organics, and
a base saturation of over 50 percent (Buol et al. 1989). They form under a wide variety of parent rocks, in
the case of the local IBTC Mollisols the parent rocks are clays. Earthworm activity is often extensive in
Mollisols, and the consequent mixing affects archeological sites by altering artifactual spatial patterns
(Rapp and Hill 1998). This soil is often heavily modified due to plowing activities associated with
agriculture. Mollisols that appear within the local IBTC project area are of the Hidalgo series (Jacobs
1981). Hidalgo soils are deep, well-drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous loamy
sediments. They occur on gently sloping uplands in the northern part of the project area and have a typical
soil horizon sequence of Ap-A-B2-B2ca-Cca.
The principal concept behind Inceptisols is that they are immature soils of humid regions that have profile
features that are more weakly developed than mature soils and retain close resemblances to the parent
material (Buol et al. 1989). These soils have an A horizon with an underlying, weakly developed B

100011499/100154

11

III: Environmental Background

horizon. The B horizon had little remnant structure and tends to be redder in color because of the
accumulation or leaching of minerals (Rapp and Hill 1998). Along the IBTC, the soil order is represented
by the Runn series (Jacobs 1981). Runn soils are deep, moderately well-drained, and slowly permeable
soils that formed in clayey sediments. They are found on nearly level stream terraces and are found in the
project area near the resaca west of FM 907. In a typical profile, Runn soils have a horizon sequence of
Ap-A-Bk-BCk-2BCk.

FLORA
The unique ecology of the Lower Rio Grande Valley is characterized by a combination of climate,
vegetation, and wildlife associations unlike anywhere else in the U.S. (Jahrsdoerfer and Leslie 1988).
Historically, the flora of the region was described as being “. . . composed of riparian lands and
bottomlands deciduous forests” (Kibler and Freeman 1993:3). However, agricultural activities in the Rio
Grande Delta region since the early part of the twentieth century have created a vegetation community
vastly different from its indigenous species (Jahrsdoerfer and Leslie 1988). These recent edaphic factors
and human activities have resulted in a shrubland climax of mixed-brush and acacia associations that
dominate the uncultivated vegetation community of the region. Mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) and
acacia (Acacia sp.) are the dominant species in this community with other scrub and brush species
throughout the area that include prickly pear (Opuntia lindheimeri), Barbados cherry or Mexican myrtle
(Malpighia glabra), and saw greenbrier (Smilax bonanox). Although the project area crosses isolated
pockets of uncultivated vegetation, the majority of the APE lies within agricultural fields, consisting
mainly of cotton, grain sorghum, sugar cane, and citrus, and residential developments with manicured
lawns.

FAUNA
The fauna of the of the region includes numerous neotropical species, numerous grassland species that
also range north of the province, some Austroriparian species from the east, and a small number of
Chihuahuan species from the west (Blair 1950, 1952). Some common small mammals that may occur in
the project area include the pocket mouse (Perognathus hispidus), white-footed mouse (Peromyscus
leucopus), southern plains woodrat (Neotoma micropus), desert cottontail (Sylvilagus audubonii), and
black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus) (Davis and Schmidly 1994). Large mammal species that have
potential to occur within the project area include white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), coyote
(Canis latrans), bobcat (Lynx rufus), and javelina (Tayassu tajacu) (Davis and Schmidly 1994). The area
supports an abundant and diverse avifauna on a seasonal basis. Some common resident species include
the mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), northern mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos), house sparrow
(Passer domesticus), olive sparrow (Arremonops rufivirgatus), the northern bobwhite (Colinus
virginianus), red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), and long-billed thrasher (Toxostoma longirostre)
(Davis and Schmidly 1994). Numerous neotropical invertebrates and vertebrates are limited in their U.S.
distribution to the region, and many are found within the U.S. only in the Lower Rio Grande Valley.

IV. CULTURAL HISTORY
The following section provides an overview of the cultural setting relevant to the current investigation by
providing a chronological summary of human occupation in the region. The archeological regions of
Texas, as recognized by Perttula (2004), are typically broadly defined by the general physiographic zones
of Texas. In this regard, Hidalgo County is located within the South Texas archeological region, which is
also referred to as the Rio Grande Plain, the Nueces Plain, or the South Texas Plain (Hester 2004). The
South Texas archeological region is defined as being located between the Balcones Escarpment to the
north and the mouth of the Rio Grande to the south, and between the Rio Grande to the west to an area
approximately 60–65 km inland from the coast to the east (Figure 5; Hester 2004). In this regard, the
project area lies along the southern extreme of the region approximately 100 km inland from the coast.
Although studies have been conducted in the region for years, the overall prehistory of the region remains
poorly understood. Phases and complexes, tool assemblages, and cultural chronologies are not well
defined. The picture is further complicated by the extensive modifications that have been made to the land
as a result of modern agricultural and ranching practices. Archeological investigations in the region have
been limited to surface collections by professional and amateur archeologists, and a few relatively minor
NRHP testing efforts. The following sequence draws heavily on the chronology outlined by Hester (2004)
with his summary of the prehistory of south Texas, and further augmented by Terneny (2005) with her
reevaluation of Late Prehistoric and Archaic period in the Rio Grande Delta of south Texas.

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (11,500 TO 8000 B.P.)
The Paleoindian period in South Texas is recognized by the presence of projectile points associated with
the period such as Clovis, Folsom, Plainview, Golondrina, Scottsbluff, and Angostura points. These
points coupled with spears aided in the pursuit of large game animals. Although intact deposits containing
evidence of Paleoindian occupations are unknown in south Texas, evidence from sites in adjacent regions
suggests the period was characterized by low population density, small bands, and large territorial ranges
of nomadic groups that subsisted by hunting Late Pleistocene megafauna. During this period, great
expanses of land were inundated by the rising sea levels. Temperatures may have been 10–15.4°
Fahrenheit cooler than today (Bousman et al. 1990:94).
The scant evidence of Paleoindian occupations in the South Texas region include Clovis points found at
sites in Wilson, Dimmit, and Atascosa counties as well as at the Southern Island site on the Mexican side
of the Rio Grande at Falcon Reservoir (Hester 2004). Folsom artifacts have been found on the Rio Grande
Plain, such as preforms and failures in Webb County and near Falcon reservoir; and isolated finds such as
a Folsom projectile point base recovered from 41CF54 near Laguna Atascosa in Cameron County
(Terneny 2005). However, no Folsom camp or kill sites have been found in the region (Hester 2004).
Later Paleoindian projectile points have been recovered mostly from the northern extent of the region
such as Golindrina, Plainview, Angostura, and Scottsbluff types from Uvalde, Bexar, Victoria, and
Williamson counties (Terneny 2005). Noted Paleoindian sites in the South Texas Archeological region

include Berger Bluff (41DG30) in Goliad County, 41WY140 in Willacy County, and the Johnston-Heller
(41VT15), J2 Ranch (41VT6), and Willeke (41VT16) sites in Victoria County.

and (16) El Paso/Hueco Bolson

THE ARCHAIC PERIOD (8000–1200 B.P.)
The Archaic period is typically known to have witnessed a shift to an exploitation of a wider range of
plant and animal species, coupled with a decrease in mobility that was probably associated with change in
the environment. Perennial steams existed in some areas of the local draws, but extensive freshwater
ponds producing diatomaceous muds also began to appear where discharge declined. Water in the lakes
and ponds fluctuated, sometimes completely drying up. By the end of the period, many of the steams
ceased to flow and the diatomite lakes evolved into muddy marshes. The transition from flowing water to
standing water represents a dramatic hydrologic change in the area. The widespread decrease in water was
the result of decrease in regional effective precipitation form the late Pleistocene to the early Holocene.
This decrease affected both runoff and spring discharge. Paleontological data (Graham 1987; Johnson
1986) document this environmental change as well as sedimentologic and stratigraphic information
(Holliday 1995), which caused streams that formerly flowed year-round to dry up.

100011499/100154

IV: Cultural History

Such a drastic, though perhaps gradual, loss of primary food sources exploited in the Paleoindian period
caused considerable cultural stress. It was probably this stress that caused a shift of attention to previously
unexploited plants and animals. Throughout the Americas, the Archaic was a time of increasing
technological (and probably social) complexity. Toolkits become larger, and through time the many
regional differences slowly coalesced into more-homogenous forms. This includes an emphasis on the
exploitation of marine resources in coastal zones (Terneny 2005). The period is often divided into the
Early, Middle, and Late periods with additional divisions such as complexes and horizons attributed to the
Archaic throughout the region. These include the Repelo (4000–2000 B.P.) and Abasolo (4000–2000 B.P.)
complexes identified by MacNeish (1947) and the early corner-notched horizon (circa 8000–5500 B.P.)
and the early basal-notched horizon (circa 5600–4500 B.P.) outlined by Hester (2004). However, overall
the period is also poorly understood in the Lower Rio Grande Valley, and sites dating to this time,
especially Early and Middle Archaic sites, are rarely encountered and are limited to surface finds. Late
Archaic sites are more common, but are often mixed with Late Prehistoric-aged deposits (Kibler and
Freeman 1993).

Early Archaic (6000–2500 B.C.)
Like the Paleoindian period, sites associated with the Early Archaic are rare in South Texas, and areas
such as the Rio Grande Delta and Sand Sheet have no representative sites for this time (Terneny 2005).
Hester’s (2004) distinction between the early corner-notched and the early basal-notched horizons are
primarily derived from data generated from Central Texas and the Lower Pecos areas with stronger
cultural chronologies (Hester 2004). Representative artifacts associated with the early corner-notched
horizon include early expanding-stem (Bandy, Martindale, and Uvalde) dart points, and the Guadalupe
distally beveled tool (Terneny 2005). The subsequent early basal-notched horizon includes Bell and
Andice points, early triangular bifaces, and Clear Fork tools (Hester 2004; Terneny 2005). The
Mackenzie site (41VT17) in Victoria County produced Bell points and radiocarbon assays indicating an
Early Archaic occupation and thus became the oldest shell midden in South Texas (Ricklis 1986).

Middle Archaic (2500–400 B.C.)
The Middle Archaic is identified by an easily recognized change in material culture patterns. This
includes assemblages in South Texas consisting of triangular dart point forms, known as Tortugas,
Abasolo, and Carrizo. In addition, smaller unifacially distally beveled tools and stemmed projectile points
have been recovered in the northern part of South Texas. These points include Pedernales, Lange,
Langtry, and Morhiss (Hester 2004). Information on settlement patterns during this period is sparse.
However, substantial data from Choke Canyon and Chaparrosa indicate that open campsites were located
along former stream channels early in the period before locating on floodplains, low terraces, and natural
levees later in the period (Hester 2004). Survey work in Willacy and Hidalgo counties has yielded dart
points that may be Archaic (Mallouf et al. 1977). However, work at Falcon Reservoir showed that some
of these types continue into the Late Prehistoric (Suhm and Jelks 1962). Investigations at the cemetery
site Loma Sandia (41LK28) in Live Oak County yielded detailed information on Middle Archaic burial

100011499/100154

15

IV: Cultural History

practices derived from 205 burials, which included interments with dart points, stone pipes, shell
ornaments, and deer antlers (Taylor and Highley 1995).

Late Archaic (400 B.C.–A.D. 800)
Dart points associated with the Late Archaic are small, with corner or side notches. Examples include
Shumla, Ensor, Frio, Marcos, Montell, Fairland, and Ellis. Tools diagnostic of this period in South Texas
include Olmos bifaces, Nueces scrapers, and corner tang bifaces (Black 1989:51). Examples of Late
Archaic sites include Choke Canyon (41LK201), the Johnson site, the Kent-Crane site, and a site at
Ingleside Cove. At Choke Canyon, hearths, earth ovens, and manos and metates have been found, which
illustrate exploitation of plant resources. Also recorded at the site were faunal remains of deer, rabbit,
turtles, fish, and other species, as well as evidence that peoples were exploiting Rabdotus snails and
mussel species (Hall et al. 1986). Additional data from Choke Canyon illustrate that favored locales for
open campsites are on stream channels and their adjacent sloughs.

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CIRCA A.D. 800–1600)
The Late Prehistoric occupation of the area by hunter-gathering inhabitants has been often referred to as
the “Brownsville Complex.” This complex has been defined on basic analysis and characteristics
observed from small surface collections, salvage excavations, and a small number of cultural resource
surveys. However, Terneny (2005:225) argues that the “. . . [Brownsville Complex] artifact sets thought
to be present only in the Late Prehistoric burial situations, were present in the Archaic as well.” She goes
on to say: “As such, the ‘Brownsville Complex’ must be redefined in terms of its presence in the Archaic
and Late Prehistoric; cemeteries and burials that contain ‘Brownsville Complex’ artifacts cannot
automatically be assumed to belong to the Late Prehistoric” (Terneny 2004:225).
Therefore, this Late Prehistoric section provides a summary of the Late Prehistoric period of south Texas
by Hester (2004) and a summary of the Brownsville Complex. However, the Brownsville Complex
summary should be understood as needing further research to determine a more precise temporal
affiliation (see Terneny 2004 for a more in-depth discussion). Although a hunting and gathering lifeway
continues in the Late Prehistoric as in the Archaic, the material culture, hunting patterns, settlement types,
and other facets of the era mark a fairly distinctive break with the past (Hester and Turner 2010). In this
time period, the bow and arrow and pottery are introduced, along with other distinctive types of stone
tools (Hester and Turner 2010). As with any time period distinction, there is limited evidence to suggest
that a new phase of cultural history was launched by the immigration of new peoples into the region as
opposed to cultural diffusion or by the coming of a radically new mode of subsistence such as agriculture.
The mode of organization of the Late Prehistoric people appears to mirror the full expression of traits
already in existence. Therefore, it appears the Late Prehistoric societies took certain practices begun in the
Archaic period and refined them to various degrees, which ultimately transformed the whole way of life.
The Late Prehistoric in southern Texas shares cultural patterns with Central Texas (Hester 2004). This
includes early “dart points” such as Ensor, Matamoros, and Scallorn found at Blue Bayou (41VT94) in
100011499/100154

16

IV: Cultural History

Victoria County and a burial site in Frio County. The main marker for the Late Prehistoric in the region is
the occurrence of the Toyah horizon. 1 Artifacts associated with the Toyah horizon include the Perdiz
point, small end scrapers, flake knives, beveled knives, bone-tempered pottery, perforators, shell
ornaments, and assorted ornamental beads and objects (Hester 2004). These have been found at site in Jim
Wells County (41JW8), Live Oak County (41LK201), and at other sites closer to central Texas. Although
sites closer to the project area in Zapata and Webb counties often yield Perdiz points and some
combination of Toyah-trait artifacts, the whole assemblage is not present with bison often absent (Hester
2004).
The bulk of our knowledge of the archeology of the Late Prehistoric in south Texas is from MacNeish’s
(1958) definition of two closely related complexes, the Brownsville and Barril, for the Lower Rio Grande
River area. This cultural complex has been defined on basic analysis and characteristics observed from
small surface collections, salvage excavations, and a small number of cultural resource surveys. Common
to both complexes are shell disks, pierced shell disk beads, plugs made from a columella that are round in
cross section, rectangular conch shell pendants, mollusc shell scrapers, and Starr, Fresno, and Matamoros
projectile points. Intrusive artifacts include pottery of Huastec origin from southern Tamaulipas, which
appears in occupation sites and in burials (Anderson 1932; MacNeish 1947; Mason 1935) as well as
obsidian and jadeite used in pendants. Burials of individuals are tightly flexed and located away from
living areas.
The largest known Brownsville/Barril site near the project area is located near the western portion of the
current ROW and is known as the Ayala site (41HG1); the site is located on a bluff of a resaca and
consisted of at least 45 flexed burials with associated burial materials. The site has been heavily looted,
but it has also been subjected to an archeological excavation (Campbell and Frizzell 1949).

PROTOHISTORIC PERIOD (CIRCA A.D. 1600–1800)
The Protohistoric period is described as the transition period between the prehistoric and historic periods.
The beginning of the period is attributed to the arrival in the early 1600s of the Europeans (Spanish) to
south Texas (Hester 2004). Indian sites from the final period are distinguished by the presence of
European and nonaboriginal American trade goods that date from the sixteenth through mid-eighteenth
centuries. Debris on Protohistoric sites indicates a continuation of the nomadic hunting and gathering
existence that was begun during the Archaic period. The best account of the native peoples of Texas
comes from the chronicle of Àlvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, a survivor of a Spanish shipwreck in 1528
(Covey 1972). These first Spaniards encountered as many as 50 different groups living in the immediate
area. Many of these indigenous people were identified as speaking the Coahuiltecan language of southern
Texas and northeastern Mexico (Salinas 1990).
The Coahuiltecan language is similar to the Karankawan, which was spoken by coastal peoples north of
Corpus Christi up to the west side of Galveston Bay (Swanton 1940). From Corpus Christi, the

IV: Cultural History

Coahuiltecan area extended northwestward to San Antonio, westward to just below the confluence of the
Pecos River and Rio Grande, and southward into Nuevo Leon, northeast of Coahuila, northern San Luis,
Potosi, northeastern Zacatecas, and northern Tamaulipas. Coahuiltecan peoples were originally
considered to be linguistically related to the Hokan groups of languages in California (Ruecking 1955;
Sapir 1920; Swanton 1940). The theory of linking the prehistoric languages of Texas and California was
known as the “Hokan Hypotheses” (Lyle 1997). Current studies suggest that Coahuiltecan was an isolated
language (Lyle 1997).
Research has indicated that the Coahuiltecans probably never existed as a single tribe. Rather, groups
with similar language were identified by the Spanish as Coahuilteco, presumably because the native
homeland of many groups was Coahuila, Mexico. By the 1850s, a combination of European-introduced
diseases and tribal wars stimulated by Europeans had decimated the Indians of south Texas (Campbell
1958). There is no extant Coahuiltecan tribe today; however, there is a group based in the San Antonio
area that calls itself the Tap Pilam—the Coahuiltecan Nation. They are not a federally recognized tribe at
this time, but the tribe has filed a petition for recognition by the Secretary of the Interior that the group
exists as an Indian tribe (Federal Register 1998).
There are no indigenous tribes extant in the area. Modern tribes that have in the past have been active in
this part of Texas include the Comanche, Kiowa, and Lipan Apache. The Comanche and Kiowa, who
both were mobile Southern Plains tribes, came into south Texas following herds of wild mustangs and
bison as well as to raid Mexican towns near the present-day international border. The traditional
homeland of the Lipan Apache included the area between the Texas Panhandle and the Hill Country of
Central Texas; however, they conducted incursions into south Texas.

HISTORIC PERIOD IN SOUTHERN HIDALGO COUNTY
Spain was the first European nation to lay claim to present-day Hidalgo County, and the Spanish were
also the first to make contact with the Native American groups living in the region. As previously stated,
Spanish exploration in the Rio Grande Valley may have occurred as early as 1528 when Àlvar Núñez
Cabeza de Vaca reportedly traveled through the area following his shipwreck in the Gulf of Mexico
(Garza 2008a). However, the theory that he traveled through what became Hidalgo County remains
unsubstantiated. After a series of attempts to settle other areas in the Lower Rio Grande Valley by
Gonzalo de Ocampo (1523), Sancho de Canielo (1528), and Pedro de Alvarado (1535) proved
unsuccessful, Spanish activity in the area centered on maintaining their sovereignty over the region rather
than encouraging colonization. As a result, subsequent exploration of what became Hidalgo County was
only initiated in response to feared encroachment by other European nations (Dixon et al. 2003).
For example, in 1638, Jacinto García de Sepulveda crossed the Rio Grande from Mexico (then Spanish
territory), in search of Dutch sailors reported to be in the current Hidalgo County area. Other excursions
into Hidalgo County were made by Alonzo de León in 1687 in search of a French fort on the Texas coast
and in 1747 by Miguel de la Garza Falcón, who traveled north of the Rio Grande in search of an area to

100011499/100154

18

IV: Cultural History

establish a settlement. Falcón was unimpressed and characterized the land north of the unfit river as for
settlement or for stock raising (Garza 2008a).
Despite Falcón’s opinion, the Spanish crown determined that the region would be settled and tasked José
de Escandόn with colonizing the area along the Rio Grande. In 1746, he was appointed “conquistador and
governor of Nuevo Santander,” the larger region containing the Lower Rio Grande Valley, and began the
process of settling the area that continued throughout his 23-year-long career. He founded 23 settlements
in all (Dixon et al. 2003), 4 of which were located south of the river in or near present-day Hidalgo
County. These settlements, including Reynosa (1749), Camargo (1749), Mier (1750), and Revilla, or
present-day Guerrero (1752) (Garza 2008a), were different from traditional Spanish colonization efforts
in that they were not centered on a strong military and/or religious presence, but relied instead on civil
defense and governance (Dixon et al. 2003). Some of these early settlers migrated and settled north of the
river, forming communities “along the river as well as in the northern reaches of the future county”
(Garza 2008a).
In 1753, residents of the area requested official, individual land allotments from the Spanish Crown.
Spain did not begin surveying and granting land possessions until 1767, at which time land was granted
on the basis of merit and seniority. Colonists were classified as “original” (original), “viejo” (old), and
“reciente” (recent) settlers, with the original settlers receiving the perceived best porciones (land grants).
Riverfront acreage was most valuable, as river access gave settlers the ability to irrigate their land and
provided a shipping channel. Thus, surveyors laid out riverfront porciones in long, narrow strips
extending several miles to the north. Larger grants were made north of the riverfront porciones and were
usually composed of significantly more acreage. These grants were typically intended for livestock
grazing, and many were granted to influential citizens of Escandόn’s original settlements (Lang and Long
2008).
Early landowners found the land conducive to livestock ranching, and several large-scale ranches formed
in the Lower Rio Grande area. Small communities of ranch workers and their families soon developed in
association with these ranches. The community of Hidalgo near the current project area was created from
one of these early settlements. In 1749, a member of Escandόn’s colony settled near the location of
present-day Hidalgo. The settlement “was known variously as La Habitaciόn, Rancho San Luis, and San
Luisito” (Garza 2008b). Early settlers here spread out to found their own large ranches in what became
Hidalgo County (Garza 2008a).
Ranching continued to characterize the region’s economy through the remainder of the eighteenth century
and into the period of Mexican rule. As original grantees died and passed their lands to their heirs, the
large ranches began to be subdivided. Through these subdivisions, new communities developed, including
La Habitaciόn, Relampago, and Peñitas (Garza 2008a).
Mexico received its independence from Spain in 1821, and the new government continued the practice of
encouraging settlement in the lower Rio Grande Valley, “especially along the navigable stretch of the

100011499/100154

19

IV: Cultural History

river between the Gulf and Roma in Starr County” (Dixon et al. 2003). During this period, scattered
ranching enterprises continued to characterize the local landscape. The key shift in local development that
occurred during the brief period of Mexican ascendency involved the increasing importance of trade to
the regional economy, which was a result of and in turn prompted an influx of American and European
entrepreneurs and settlers “seeking economic opportunities” (Dixon et al. 2003).
Following Texas independence in 1836, the Rio Grande Valley became a disputed territory, claimed by
both the Republic of Texas and Mexico and later the United States and Mexico. This dispute, along with
other political and military disagreements, led to the Mexican-American War (1846–1848). During this
conflict, Zachary Taylor oversaw the survey of the Old Military Road (41HG230) that connected
Brownsville and Rio Grande City. This route, roughly paralleling the Rio Grande, became a major
transportation artery through the area, linking many established communities and providing the impetus
for the foundation of more communities along its reach. The route likely paralleled or followed
established trails linking area ranches and associated communities. Following the Mexican-American
War, the road continued to serve as a shipping route for cotton and other goods and as southern Hidalgo
County’s main travel artery. By the 1960s, the road was paved and improved and still serves as a major
transportation thoroughfare for the Lower Rio Grande Valley region (Jones 2008). The recognized route
was recorded in 2009 by GTI Environmental, Inc. and is mapped as paralleling Doffin Canal, just south
and outside of the project area.
By 1850, approximately 40 large ranches were operating in present-day Hidalgo County. The ranches not
only served as the economic mainstay for residents, but also influenced local community development
during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Some of the first communities established in Hidalgo
County were developed in support of large ranches. Various examples exist within and in the vicinity of
the current study area, including La Habitaciόn, at the site of present-day Hidalgo, which originally
formed in association with Rancho San Luis in 1749 (Garza 2008b). The city of McAllen owes its roots to
the McAllen Ranch, originally known as the Santa Anita Ranch, founded circa 1797 by José Manuel
Gόmez, an original Spanish grantee (Garza 2008c). Present-day Peñitas originally served as the “common
grazing grounds” for Escandόn’s Villa de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe de Reynosa located south of the
Rio Grande in the mid-eighteenth century. After 1850, the community was associated with numerous
populous ranches in the area, including those of Rόmulo Martínez and Jesús Chapa Cantú (Garza 2008d).
The modern community of Abram, a portion of which falls within the project’s APE, was located along
“the original military highway from Brownsville to Fort Ringgold,” and like nearby Peñitas, served as the
common grazing grounds for Reynosa. During the nineteenth century, the community was associated with
the Ojo de Agua, or Watering Hole, Ranch (Norton 2008).
Ranching continued to be an important part of the local economy during the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries, and various ranching enterprises were located in the vicinity of the current project
area. The headquarters for the San Juan Plantation, named by owner John Closner, was located
approximately 2,000 ft south of the proposed route; however, the community that emerged to house the
ranch workers and their families, including a school, appears to have been adjacent to the proposed ROW.
100011499/100154

20

IV: Cultural History

Closner began acquiring land in the area in 1884, and his plantation eventually contained 45,000 acres.
He was an innovator in the area and transformed the land through a system of irrigation canals and a
water-pumping plant, creating the first irrigation system from the Rio Grande. The efforts inspired the
extensive irrigation systems now present in the area. Diverse crops were grown on the plantation,
including sugarcane, alfalfa, tobacco, vegetables, fruits, melons, and nuts, and he traded on both sides of
the river. Many families worked on the plantation, and a community developed in the area with a school
and general store (McKenna 2008a; THC Sites Atlas 1964).
The adjacent Nathaniel Jackson ranch was also located in the project vicinity. Jackson, a former slave
owner, arrived in Hidalgo County in 1857 with his wife Matilda Hicks, an African American, as well as
their children and his former slaves. Jackson’s ranch encompassed 5,500 acres, and he “raised livestock
and grew vegetables, cotton and sugarcane.” His property became a haven for runaway slaves, and he
constructed a chapel that served the community associated with his ranch (THC Sites Atlas 2005). Two
cemeteries associated with the ranch and a historic marker commemorating the chapel are located in the
project vicinity, though both of the cemeteries are located outside of the ROW.
Another ranch of note that historically operated within the project vicinity is the La Lomita Ranch and
Mission. René Guyard, a French merchant living in Reynosa, willed the ranch to the Oblates of Mary
Immaculate, a group of French Catholic missionaries, in 1861. The transfer included two discontinuous
tracts on porciones 55 and 57 originally granted by the Spanish government in 1767. The Oblates
purchased the intervening land on porcione 56 in 1884. The missionaries operated a ranching and farming
operation at the site and built a chapel designated as the headquarters for the Oblate mission for the entire
county. The mission property stretched 15 miles north of the Rio Grande and occupied 2 miles of
riverfront property (Wright 2008).
With the emergence of the railroad and irrigation improvements in the early 1900s, the Oblates sold most
of their land to the north, retaining only the riverfront acreage. It was on this tract in 1912 that the order
constructed “a large three-story brick building . . . to house their novitiate program.” This program
subsequently moved to a facility on the Kenedy Ranch until 1962, after which the building served a
variety of uses until 1974 when it and the surrounding property were “nominally leased for fifty years to
La Lomita Farms, a project of the Tropical Texas Center for Mental Health and Mental Retardation.” The
old chapel experienced many periods of refurbishment and repair and is currently housed within
Anzalduas Park located south of the project area. La Lomita was designated as a National Register
Historic District in 1974 (Wright 2008).
Though ranching remained important into the twentieth century, the arrival of the St. Louis, Brownsville,
and Mexico Railroad in 1904 dramatically affected regional development patterns and local land use.
New communities sprang up along the railway and subsequent lines that intersected this route, and old
settlements originally founded around ranches grew into sizable communities. The city of Donna located
north of the current study area was founded in 1904 when a branch of the St. Louis, Brownsville and
Mexico Railroad reached the site. Prior to its arrival, the area was part of the La Blanca land grant

100011499/100154

21

IV: Cultural History

occupied by the Cabazos family. The name was chosen in honor of Donna Fletcher, a local rancher who
later served as postmistress for the town. Donna quickly became a major regional shipping point for area
produce (Garza 2008e).
Run (Runn), located near the southeastern terminus of the proposed route, was founded in 1903 by
George and Ed Ruthven. The Ruthvens came to the lower Rio Grande Valley from the Beaumont area.
They opened a general store that soon became a congregation point for new settlers in the area. The
community was granted a post office in 1904 that operated until 1916 to serve the small community that
had formed around the general store. Run began to decline in the mid-1910s when bandit raids, poor flood
control, and growth in the town of Donna to the north drove many settlers out of the community (Gilbert
2008). Recent levee and construction projects have erased numerous features of the community, though
archeological remnants could exist.
Mission, located to the north of the proposed route, was founded in 1907 when John J. Conway and J.W.
Hoit purchased 27,000 acres (17,000 from the Oblates of Mary Immaculate) in the area in anticipation of
the wave of new settlers arriving via the railroad. In 1908, the railroad arrived in Mission, and the city
incorporated in 1910. Fueled by the development of irrigation technology that allowed for the production
of three crops per year, citrus cultivation, transport, and processing were major facets of the town’s
economy. Mission became known as “the home of the grapefruit,” and agriculture in the form of
cultivation rather than ranching, and later, oil and gas extraction and the construction of military training
centers, fueled its rapid development in the twentieth century (Heller 2008).
McAllen, which was a small community associated with the McAllen/Santa Anita Ranch established circa
1797, also experienced a period of growth with the arrival of the railroad. In 1904, when the Hidalgo and
San Miguel Extension of the St. Louis, Brownsville, and Mexico Railway reached the site, members of
the Ballí and McAllen families, proprietors of McAllen Ranch, donated land to allow the railroad to cross
their property. The McAllen Townsite Company formed later that year and named the new townsite
McAllen. McAllen grew at a steady, yet somewhat slower rate than other railroad towns in the area due to
competition from neighboring communities. However, the town incorporated in 1911 and experienced a
population boom during the late 1910s as a result of federal troops being stationed in the area (Garza
2008c).
During the late 1800s through the mid-1900s, several brickyards were located in or near the project area.
Some of these earlier brickyards were associated with the large ranches in the area, while other later
enterprises were established solely as brickmaking operations for the area. An 1898 International
Boundary map depicts two brickyards near Granjeño, in the project area vicinity. A successful
brickmaking enterprise run by a German settler, Guenther Weiske, was located at or near Madero, another
community adjacent to the current project area. Weiske’s Madero home was constructed of handmade
bricks from the El Gavilàn brickyard near Granjeño. Weiske’s bricks were used in the construction of the
La Lomita novitiate, south of Madero (Cook 1998). It is likely that several other brickyards existed
throughout the lower Rio Grande Valley (Gilbert 2008).

IV: Cultural History

Contemporaneous to the emergence of the railroad, irrigation was also advancing in Hidalgo County.
Advances in irrigation technology and the development of major irrigation systems increased both largescale commercial farming and small-scale irrigated farming in the area. The first irrigation system in the
area was developed in 1895 to serve the San Juan Plantation located on the banks of the Rio Grande
(McKenna 2008b). The American Rio Grande Land and Irrigation Company, incorporated in 1905,
constructed a massive system of pumping stations, canals, laterals, and settling basins in Hidalgo County.
This system, like many others, was a public system in that it sold water to private landowners, allowing
an increase in irrigated farmland (Goza 2008).
Farmers gained access to new markets via the railroad and improved farming capabilities via irrigation
improvements. Contemporaneously, land speculators began advertising the area’s prime farmland in the
East and Midwest, attracting a new wave of Anglo-American settlers to the area. The trend of increased
farming and railroad expansion continued through the 1930s as more railroad companies built lines
through the area and irrigation improvements continued to multiply. The area’s transition from a ranchbased economy to one based on truck farming was complete by 1930, when there were 4,321 farms in the
county, “more than double the number in 1920,” and ranching had been relegated to the northern portion
of the county. The majority of the farms engaged in cotton cultivation during this period (Garza 2008a).
Unlike other areas in Texas and the country as a whole, Hidalgo County’s population and the number of
farms increased during the Great Depression. This was due in part to the discovery of oil in 1934, which
continued to represent an important part of the county’s economy through the remainder of the twentieth
century (Garza 2008a). Besides its economic impact, the success of the oil and gas industry also resulted
in significant alterations to traditional local land use patterns, as oil and gas wells and related roadways
became a common interruption in the agricultural landscape.
In the 1960s, a decline in the cotton market resulted in a dramatic reduction in land values in the area, and
many farmers sold all or portions of their land to developers. Some of these developers platted new
subdivisions near cities, where employment opportunities were available in processing and other fields. In
more-rural areas, some sold small plots at exorbitantly low rates to low-income families. These areas,
known as colonias, were located outside of city limits on unfavorable farmland. These communities were
largely unregulated and were characterized by squalid living conditions and a lack of public works
services. Many of the houses were constructed by hand of scrap material, and residents obtained water
from tainted wells or brought water in from incorporated areas, often in contaminated containers. By the
1980s, activists began urging officials to act regarding the high rates of disease in border colonias, but
despite these efforts no legislation was passed (Garcia 2008). Many of these colonias remain in the area
and are home to low-income farm laborers and their families. Two examples near the project area are the
existing colonias that developed around the communities of Abram and Madero beginning in the 1960s
(Garza 2008f; Norton 2008). Although these communities are often ephemeral, there could be
archeological remnants within the current project area.

IV: Cultural History

Hidalgo County continues to depend heavily on large-scale agricultural production, processing, and
transportation, though commercial agricultural corporations have replaced the independent growers as the
biggest producers. The Old Military Road is now part of US 281, which links several international
boundary points along the Rio Grande and continues north to the Oklahoma-Texas state line. Since the
passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994, truck transport traffic along the highway
has increased in the region as more imports from Mexico are brought to the United States. Other
important facets of the area’s economy and development at present include oil and gas extraction and
tourism.

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
The earliest and most extensive work in the south Texas area is that of A.E. Anderson. From 1908 to
1940, Anderson collected and kept records on data from the south Rio Grande Valley and adjacent part of
Tamaulipas, Mexico. In 1932, he published a brief description of his artifacts from the Brownsville area
(Anderson 1932).
Espey, Huston and Associates, Inc. (EH&A, now PBS&J) conducted several archeological investigations
in Hidalgo County. These include the survey of a transmission line corridor for the Magic Valley Electric
Cooperative (EH&A 1983) and the archeological assessment of the Central Power and Light Company’s
Cross Valley Tie transmission line (EH&A 1992). EH&A archeologists also conducted archeological
investigations in Hidalgo County for Central Power and Light Company’s transmission line relocation in
the Cimarron Subdivision and for Central and South West Services’ Mexico Tie transmission line project
(EH&A 1994) and for a cultural resources survey for a previous Sharyland transmission line project
(Schmidt 1998).
Other major archeological investigations in Hidalgo County include the Hidalgo-Willacy Drainage Ditch
Survey (Bousman et al. 1990; Hall et al. 1987; Prewitt and Day 1981; Prewitt and Mercado-Allinger
1983; Quigg et al. 1989) and the survey conducted for the Hidalgo County Irrigation District No. 16
(Etchieson and Boyd 1982). Archeological work has been conducted at the Bentsen-Rio Grande Valley
State Park (Hartmann et al. 1995), for the Mission Industrial Site Infrastructure Project (Houk et al. 1995),
and for the Colonias Wastewater Treatment Assistance Program Project (Jones et al. 1995). A cultural
resources survey was also completed for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Edinburg Facility
(Rader and Leach-Palm 1995). Archeological and geomorphological investigations and historic research
have been conducted for the Pharr-Reynosa International Bridge (Boyd et al. 1994; Kibler and Freeman
1993) and for the Anzalduas International Crossing (Keller 1995).

V. METHODS
The following section provides the methods used in completing the cultural resources survey of the
proposed IBTC. This includes the methodology for conducting the background records review for
archeological resources and historic-aged nonarcheological resources, a historic standing structures
survey, and an intensive archeological survey. The methods complied with the applicable standards as
defined in 13 TAC 26.20 and policies of the THC and the CTA standards.

ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND REVIEW
A PBS&J archeologist performed a background literature review to determine whether the project area
had been previously surveyed for cultural resources or if any archeological sites are located within or near
(2 km) the project area. To conduct this review, the PBS&J archeologist reviewed the Pharr, Donna, Las
Milpas, and San Juan SE U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle maps at
TARL, and searched the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (an online database) and site files at
TARL. These sources provided information on the nature and location of previously conducted
archeological surveys and previously recorded cultural resource sites. In addition to identifying recorded
archeological sites, the review included the following types of information on the Texas Archeological
Sites Atlas: NRHP properties, SALs, Official Texas Historical Markers (OTHMs), Registered Texas
Historic Landmarks (RTHLs), cemeteries, and local neighborhood surveys.

HISTORIC-AGED NONARCHEOLOGICAL RESOURCES RECORDS
REVIEW
Prior to initiating the historic standing structures survey, project historians consulted the THC’s Texas
Historic Sites Atlas (an online database) to identify previously recorded historic properties within the
proposed ROW and APE. In addition to the records review, a brief subject search of the Handbook of
Texas Online yielded contextual information about the area’s social and economic development,
particularly issues related to agricultural development. Historic maps, including those compiled in
TxDOT’s Texas Historic Overlay (Foster et al. 2006), were also examined. The review provided an
outline of anticipated property types within the IBTC project area, which included irrigation-related
resources, remnants of historic-aged farmsteads or ranches, residential resources, transportation-related
sites such as culverts and bridges, and commercial resources.

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH
With regards to newly recorded historic period archeological sites, PBS&J historians adapted their
archival research efforts in response to the nature of the sites. The level of effort was based on the inferred
age of identified deposits and their potential to yield significant information about the region’s early
history. Because the historic period of occupation in the project area extends back almost 250 years,
historians identified deposits associated with the region’s early history, particularly the Spanish and

100011499/100154

25

V: Methods

Mexican era, as resources that would have particular significance and require more in-depth archival
analysis. Project archeologists did not record any sites dating to this early period. Instead, the two newly
recorded archeological sites appear to date to the early to mid-twentieth century. As a result, they do not
represent the remains of historic ranching enterprises or no-longer-extant communities associated with
early local ranches. Therefore, project historians limited their research efforts to historic aerial and map
reviews and interviews with local informants when possible. Through these efforts, project historians
sought to identify potential occupants or historic associations. The Principal Investigator evaluated this
information in conjunction with the archeological evidence in order to offer preliminary eligibility
assessments for the recorded historic sites.

Archival Research Issues
Due to the unique history of and development in the current project area, project historians utilized a
somewhat nontraditional approach when researching any identified historic period archeological sites. As
discussed in the historic context section, land within the current project area was originally granted to
early residents as porciones, which were “rectangular strips along the Rio Grande and other tributaries . . .
[that] included between 1/2 and 9/13 of a mile in river frontage to ensure water access for livestock or
irrigation.” The tracts were between 11 and 14 miles deep and typically contained between 4,200 and
6,200 acres (Galindo 2003). The Spanish government officially transferred title to these parcels to citizens
of José de Escandón’s original colonies in 1767, though many residents had been living or ranching on
their property for years prior to acquiring official title.
The length of time between occupation and title was related to the process of applying for and receiving
land under Spanish rule. Under Spanish law, ownership of land in New Spain required “an original
concession from the Crown.” Land was granted in the monarch’s name and was “subject in principle to
royal confirmation” (Greaser 2003). This process was costly and time consuming, and to many citizens,
the value of the land in question was not equivalent to the cost of procuring it. Additionally, many
individuals abandoned their property during the tumultuous period between 1812 and 1821, never to
reclaim it. As a result, “most of the surviving titles from the Spanish province of Texas are for land in an
extensive area surrounding Nacogdoches” (Greaser 2003).
In theory, early landowners in the project vicinity would have retained title to their property during the
period of Mexican rule and into the Texas Republic era; however, the extension of the porciones into
what became disputed territory means that early records may not exist and/or be available for researchers.
After the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which “established Texas’ de facto jurisdiction in the area
between the Nueces and Rio Grande rivers,” validating the titles to the property there became of primary
concern to officials at the Texas General Land Office (Greaser 2003). To facilitate the investigation of the
claims, laws were passed in 1850, 1854, 1860, 1870, and 1901. The legislation prompted attempts to
locate records in Mexican archives and to identify those in the possession of private citizens, most of
which were unsuccessful (Greaser 2003).

100011499/100154

26

V: Methods

In 1871, the Texas legislature commissioned John L. Haynes to “obtain a transcript and translation of the
acts or charters of the towns of Reynosa, Camargo, Mier, Guerrero, and Laredo, which included the
porciones grants.” The translations were to be deposited at the Texas General Land Office “within one
year after the passage of the act” (Greaser 2003). A subsequent act in 1881 “required that a copy of every
validated title for which there was no evidence on file be placed in the Land Office, either in the form of a
testimonio or a certified copy from the county record.” At present, only 20 such documents are housed in
the General Land Office’s collection.
Besides the confusion caused by the age of the original grants, as well as their tremendous size and the
various governments that would have had control of the records over time, the project area’s location near
the Rio Grande creates further problems in locating related records. The continuous shifting of the
international boundary line due to the movement of the river means that some pieces of property have
been part of both Mexico and the United States at various times during their history. As a result, many of
the land records required to complete chain of title research would be in Mexico rather than in Hidalgo
County, and thus unavailable to researchers.

INTENSIVE ARCHEOLOGICAL FIELD SURVEY
The archeological field survey consisted of a team of PBS&J archeologists conducting an intensive
pedestrian survey with shovel testing of the accessible portions of the IBTC project area. The survey was
conducted by excavating shovel tests along a series of transects spaced at approximately 30 m (98 ft)
within varying widths of the APE. The THC and CTA survey standards call for a minimum of 16 shovel
tests per linear mile, which equates to approximately 500 shovel tests in the accessible 14.1-mile portion
of the project area, accounting for areas with a ROW greater than 100 feet (30 m). A total of 878 shovel
tests were conducted throughout the project area even though numerous areas did not warrant shovel
testing because of extensive subsurface disturbances due to modern industry and urban/suburban
development. In addition, recent storm events have inundated the region and swelled local waterways,
flooding several low-lying areas especially La Cruz Resaca and the associated Main Floodway. The
additional shovel tests were placed in high probability areas described below. All shovel tests were
excavated in 10-cm arbitrary levels to 1 m in depth. The matrix was screened through ¼-inch mesh
hardware cloth. The location of each shovel test was plotted using a Geographic Positioning System
(GPS) receiver, and each test was recorded on appropriate project field forms. All shovel tests were
excavated on private property.
Of note, previously conducted archeological surveys have demonstrated that the primary factor governing
most prehistoric site locations is distance to a natural water source. In addition, previous archeological
work conducted in the area by Anderson (1932) identified general topographic settings for prehistoric
sites. Based on Anderson’s findings, Prewitt (1974) concluded that there were five distinct settings where
sites were most frequently located: alluvial terraces adjacent to streams or rivers; broad upland areas that
are often remnants of Pleistocene alluvial terraces; clay dunes, particularly where they face lagunas and
inland lakes; on resacas; and on the barrier islands. Building upon these previous investigations, Mallouf

100011499/100154

27

V: Methods

et al. (1977) developed a predictive model citing eolian depressions or playas as major water sources that
attracted wildlife and vegetation, and consequently, archeological sites. Therefore, since a characteristic
feature of the IBTC project area is numerous resacas or abandoned channels and Holocene-aged deposits,
it was anticipated that the lands surrounding these natural features were high probability areas for
prehistoric sites. Based on this reasoning, all of the accessible portions of the proposed IBTC ROW
within 100 m of resacas and natural streams were shovel tested at intervals conforming to or surpassing
those established by the CTA. However, the Main Floodway (La Cruz Resaca) portion of these high
probability areas was the exception as this area was inundated or severely saturated throughout the time of
the investigations and included the 0.6-mile-long inaccessible parcel (Appendix A and Figure 6).

This photo depicts floodwaters beyond the resaca banks with saturated grounds
in the adjacent fields and low-lying vegetation.

Archeological sites were recorded on a State of Texas Archeological Site Data Form. Site sketch maps
were drawn, and a photographic record was maintained of the recorded sites. No artifacts were collected
during the survey, with all artifacts observed in the field described in sufficient detail. All notes,
drawings, daily journals, site record forms, photographs, and other documentation will be curated at the

HISTORIC STANDING STRUCTURES SURVEY METHODOLOGY
As part of the archeological survey effort, project historians documented and evaluated all historic-age
nonarcheological (pre-1965) resources (buildings, structures, objects, districts, etc.) within the project
area. Historians conducted the documentation effort in accordance with the Secretary of the Interior’s
Standards for the Identification, Evaluation and Documentation (36 Code of Federal Regulations 61) of
historic resources to document buildings, structures, objects, and districts in the project area constructed
prior to 1965. This date provides a recommended 5-year buffer to allow for any potential delays in project
letting. These historic studies were performed and documented at sufficient levels to satisfy THC
requirements for determining the presence of historically significant properties in the APE in accordance
with 36 CFR 60 and 13 TAC 26.
Each historic-age resource in the project area was photographed (Appendix G), with all photographs
clearly depicting architectural and other details relevant to an evaluation of the resource’s characterdefining features. Photographs were attached to separately labeled pages that clearly identify project
name, address of resource, and project ID number. Additionally, project historians produced inventories
of all resources that detail their project ID numbers, locations, property type and subtype classifications,
stylistic influences, construction dates, integrity issues, and preliminary eligibility recommendations. The
tables including this information are included in Appendix H. Preliminary SAL and NRHP (where
applicable) eligibility recommendations for all recorded resources are included in this report.
Besides individual resources within the IBTC, historians were also aware of the potential for the existence
of historic districts and landscapes that might extend outside of the current project area. Historians
visually examined adjacent landscapes and neighborhoods from publicly accessible vantage points to
assess the potential for historic districts that extend beyond the IBTC. No such resources were identified
during the course of the survey effort.
Regarding irrigation resources, project historians followed the guidelines for documentation of irrigation
resources set forth by TxDOT in August 2007 and in A Field Guide to Irrigation in the Lower Rio Grande
Valley (Knight 2009). This included the historic-age components of the irrigation districts (Hidalgo
County Irrigation District [HCID] No. 1 and HCID No. 2) that extend into the IBTC, including but not
limited to pump stations, canals, laterals, ditches, standpipes, dams, and water gates.

VI. RESULTS
ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND REVIEW
The archeological background review revealed there are no prehistoric or historic archeological sites
documented within the project area. Aside from the 2009 Section A survey, two previously conducted
surveys intersect portions of the IBTC project area. These consist of a survey for the expansion of FM
2557 (Stewart Road) conducted in 2007 and a survey for a waste water line running parallel to FM 493
conducted in 2008. No sites were recorded within or adjacent to the IBTC project area during these
previously conducted surveys. However, there are four previously recorded sites within 2 km of the
project area (41HG158, 41HG159, 41HG160, and 41HG230).
Sites 41HG158–41HG160 were recorded by Prewitt and Associates, Inc. in 1992 during the archeological
investigations for the Pharr-Reynosa International Bridge (Boyd. et al 1994). Site 41HG158 is a sparse
lithic scatter located south of the Doffin Canal, approximately 1,985 m southwest of the southwestern
terminus of the IBTC project area. Investigations determined that the site deposits lack integrity due to
severe modern disturbances. Site 41HG159 is a surficial scatter of historic artifacts dating to the early
twentieth and late nineteenth centuries located 1,590 m southwest of the project area. Although no
structures are present throughout the site, historic maps indicate the presence of four structures. The site
form indicates these structures may be the De La Vina or Paulo Jackson house sites. Site 41HG160 is
located 1,100 m southwest of the southwestern terminus of the IBTC project area, along the west side of
South “I” road. The site is the remnants of a structure as indicated by crushed lumber, concrete fragments,
wood window frames, and assorted historic artifacts. The structure appears to have been recently razed, as
one structure is mapped at this location on the 1978 USGS topographical map. The site form indicates
that the structure is likely the Ruperto Rodriguez house site. The final site, 41HG230, is the Old Military
Road that connected Brownsville and Rio Grande City mentioned in the historic context section. None of
the sites extend into the current IBTC project area.

HISTORIC-AGED NONARCHEOLOGICAL RESOURCES RECORDS
REVIEW
Historians searched the Texas Historic Sites Atlas to identify any previously designated historic
properties within the proposed ROW and APE. The records review revealed no SALs, no OTHMs, and no
RTHLs within the project footprint. The project area is located within the boundaries of the NRHP-listed
Louisiana-Rio Grande Canal Company Irrigation System. Contributing elements of the NRHP-listed
Louisiana-Rio Grande Canal Company Irrigation System include the first and second lift pump houses
and the above- and belowground canal system. This district is currently under the jurisdiction of the
HCID No. 2. The eastern portion of the project area is located within the boundaries of the historic-aged
Donna Irrigation District, also known as HCID No. 1.

VI: Results

INTENSIVE ARCHEOLOGICAL FIELD SURVEY
A cultural resources intensive survey of portions of the IBTC ROW was conducted by PBS&J on January
15–30, 2009, July 22–29, 2010, and October 18–21, 2010. Most of the areas within the ROW were
recently plowed, recently harvested, or contained standing crops of primarily sorghum, cotton, and
sugarcane. Several of these fields were actively being irrigated during both the 2009 and 2010 surveys
(Figure 7). As previously stated, the THC survey standards call for a minimum of 16 shovel tests per
linear mile for a 100-m-wide ROW, which equals to at least 500 shovel tests in the accessible 14.1-mile
portion of the project area; however, several areas did not warrant testing because of flooding/saturation
or extensive modern disturbances (Figure 8). Nevertheless, a total of 878 shovel tests were placed within
the ROW to cover the minimum standards as well as the varying width of the planned project (Figure 9).
The additional shovel tests were conducted in the high probability areas along canals, waterways, and
along existing roads for the likelihood of historic activity areas.
During the survey, two newly recorded historic archeological sites were observed, sites 41HG224 and
41HG237 (Appendix B, not for public disclosure). The sites are described further below. Aside from the
two historic sites, the pedestrian survey did not locate any additional cultural material other than recent
scattered trash in the project area. None of the shovel tests encountered artifacts or features. Overall, the
intensive survey with shovel testing revealed prevalent shallowly buried clays. Most of the shovel tests
were located in active agricultural fields with subsurface disturbances throughout the plow zone. The
natural stratigraphy that was encountered displayed clay strata containing abundant white filaments of
calcrete indicating pedogenic illuvation, which suggests older deposits. In the disturbed areas that were
not subjected to subsurface examination, there is little potential for buried cultural resources to be present
due to the severity of previous disturbances. One of these areas consisted of a construction zone for the
installation of a concrete water pipe between Main and Kennard streets in the town of Donna and an
existing concrete-lined canal and berm. This construction area was examined by the field archeologists,
with no cultural material observed within the backdirt piles for the pipe installation.

Geoarcheological Investigations
In addition to the intensive survey with shovel testing, PBS&J geoarcheologists conducted
geoarcheological investigations on October 19 and 20, 2010, within the high probability areas at the
locations where the vertical APE is substantially deeper than accessible by shovel testing. These
investigations consisted of excavating exploratory mechanical trenches at the proposed overpass and
pilings for bridges locations. Originally, nine locations were determined to necessitate exploratory
trenching. However, two of the locations continued to be inundated with standing water stemming from
the recent heavy rains. These consisted of the area within the Main Floodway near La Cruz Resaca and
the drainage canal along San Juan Road between Anaya and Las Milpas roads. Therefore, a total of eight
trenches were excavated at seven of the nine locations (Figure 10). The trenches typically measured 1 m
(3 ft) wide, 5 m (17 ft), long, and 1.2 m (4 ft) deep. Detailed descriptions of the soil profiles were

documented with the locations of the trenches recorded on a Trimble Geo XT. In addition, the trench
profiles and setting were photographed.
Overall, no cultural materials or features were encountered in any of the mechanical trenches. Appendix
C provides descriptions and photographs of the excavated trenches and the general setting. Although
trenches were unable to be excavated within the Main Floodway near La Cruz Resaca, the pedestrian
survey with shovel testing in the vicinity of this location did not encounter any cultural material on the
surface or in the subsurface excavations. Site 41HG224 was found approximately 170 m south of the
drainage canal along San Juan Road between Anaya and Las Milpas roads. However, shovel tests beyond
the site boundaries and closer to the canal were negative for subsurface cultural material with no artifacts
or features observed on the surface.

Site 41HG224
Site 41HG224 is located on a slight rise near the southwestern corner of the intersection of San Juan Road
and a secondary irrigation canal between Anaya Road and Las Milpas Road. The site was recorded in
2009 during the original Section A survey. This site represents at least one historic occupation period
dating to the early to mid-twentieth century. The only temporally sensitive artifact recovered is solarized
glass, which dates from 1880 to 1918. The site area is also littered with modern debris including beer
bottles, ceramic light fixtures, cinder blocks, and PVC pipe. Multiple push piles containing construction
materials were also observed around the site area, indicting the clearing and destruction of the original
structures. The site has been severely degraded by mechanical clearing activities associated with
agriculture. The site was initially located based upon its surface expression, which includes a single
cement slab foundation measuring 35 m by 15 m, a cement U-shaped walkway measuring 15 m in length,
a possible cistern comprised of dry-laid bricks, and a light scatter of historic artifacts on the ground
surface (Figure 11). A total of six shovel tests were then excavated across the site area to determine the
horizontal and vertical extent, four of which were positive for cultural materials yielding the following
artifacts in levels 1 through 6 (0–60 centimeters below the surface): brown glass, colorless glass, green
glass, blue glass, colorless-solarized glass, refined earthenware ceramics, wood shingles, carbon samples,
various metal artifacts, faunal remains, bricks, cement, and plastic.
Project historians conducted archival investigations into this site using the methodology approved in the
research design. This includes historic map and aerial photography research and contact with the current
property owners to gain further information about the site’s occupation and history. The landowner could
not provide any additional information on the site’s origin, having bought the land in recent years.
Historians examined the historic maps included in TxDOT’s Historic Map Overlay and at the Texas State
Library and Archives in an attempt to gain additional historic information pertaining to this site. The 1916
San Juan Quadrangle depicts no standing structure in the vicinity of this site. However, one building is
depicted in the area in 1925 (U.S. Department of Agriculture 1925), located on the opposite side of San

Juan Road from the site. A building is indicated at this same location on the east side of San Juan Road on
a 1939 aerial photograph and a 1940 highway map, but no buildings appear on the west side of San Juan
Road on either of these sources (Texas Natural Resources Information System Aerial Photography
Database 1939, Texas State Highway Department 1940). By 1954, there was a cluster of development in
the vicinity of the site on both sides of San Juan Road; however, given the scale of the source photograph,
individual buildings were not identifiable (Texas Natural Resources Information System Aerial
Photography Database 1954). This cluster of development is more defined on a 1961 aerial photograph,
which depicts several buildings at and around the site location. These included three buildings in the
vicinity of the existing concrete slab with a row of trees partially encircling the group of structures on the
south and west sides. To the northwest of these buildings was a large, apparently flat-roofed, building
with two smaller associated structures. A no-longer-extant driveway or roadway, roughly parallel to the
canal located to the north, provided access to these buildings. There were approximately three additional
structures located on the north side of this driveway (Texas Natural Resources Information System Aerial
Photography Database (1961).
Although three features were located on the site, the lack of diagnostic artifacts greatly limits the potential
for the site to yield additional research information. In addition, the archival investigation determined that
the area has been severally modified with several structures completely removed. Furthermore, the site
has been impacted with fence and roadway construction and from mechanical clearing associated with
nearby agricultural activities. No elements that could contribute to the site's potential for NRHP eligibility
were observed within the present project area. Therefore, no further investigation of this site is
recommended in association with the proposed project.

Site 41HG237
Site 41HG237 is located on a slight rise in the northeast corner of the intersection of Dicker Road and a
secondary irrigation drain, 0.5 mile east of the Tower Road and Dicker Road intersection (Figure 12). The
site is indicated by a small stand of mesquite trees. This site was located during the July 22–29, 2010,
cultural resources survey, but was not recorded as the site was flooded at the time. The site was revisited
during the October 18–21, 2010, survey and determined to be a historic occupation locale dating to the
mid-twentieth century. Features include two concrete slab foundations and a possible windmill concrete
mount associated with a 4-x-4-ft water retention tank. Artifacts observed on the site include various types
of glass including solarized glass, wire nails, and earthenware ceramics intermixed with several pieces of
modern debris. Within two areas of the site are standing beams and metal including sections of a truck
frame standing on end. The site does not appear to have been degraded by mechanical clearing activities
associated with the nearby agricultural field. Six trees located on the western side of the site were likely
intentionally planted, possibly serving as a wind break.
Initially, the site appears to be similar to that of 41HG244, a possible homestead from the early to midtwentieth century. An archival investigation into this site found no indication of a building at the location

prior to a 1954 aerial photograph with a 1961 road map depicting a school at the location. However, the
site investigations did not encounter any artifacts that definitively suggest that the structures were a
school. Therefore, the archival investigation has determined that the area has been severally modified
with all structures completely removed. In addition, although three features were located on the site, the
lack of diagnostic artifacts greatly limits the potential for the site to yield additional research information.
No elements that could contribute to the site's potential for NRHP eligibility were observed within the
present project area. Therefore, no further investigation of this site is recommended in association with
the proposed project.

HISTORIC STANDING STRUCTURES SURVEY
Properties within the Project ROW
The historic standing structures survey was conducted in November 2009. Project historians surveyed the
proposed project ROW for the presence of historic-aged resources. Historic-aged resources were
photographed and their locations mapped. Historians documented a total of 64 historic-age resources
within the proposed ROW. Of these, 61 are irrigation-related resources including standpipes, canals,
ditches, gates, reservoirs and well pumps.
Resources 05A–AJ are components of the Donna Irrigation District (HCID No. 2) (Appendix D). This
irrigation district was determined not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP in 2008 (Chandler 2010). These
resources include 24 concrete standpipes (05B, C, E–I, L–R, U–X, Z–AE, and AG–AJ), 5 canals (05A, D,
K, T, and Y), one well (05AF), one reservoir (05J), and one gate (07F). This irrigation district was
determined not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP in 2008 and no further consideration of this resource is
recommended under any applicable regulatory criteria.
Resources 06A-Y are components of the NRHP-listed Louisiana-Rio Grande Canal Company Irrigation
District (HCID No. 1) (Appendix E). Resources 06B–F, H, I, K, M, T, W, and X are concrete standpipes
that are not identified as contributing elements of the resource in the NRHP nomination (THC 2010).
These resources were designed to function in tandem with underground pipelines that were frequently
abandoned, removed, and relocated; as such, they do not accurately represent the district’s period of
significance, which terminates at 1949. Historians also documented one irrigation well (06A) located in
the proposed ROW. Structure 06A is not identified as a contributing element of the resource in the NRHP
nomination (THC 2010).
The project also crosses 12 irrigation canals (resources 06G, J, L, N–S, U, V, and Y) that are included in
the NRHP nomination as contributing to the resource’s eligibility. It is recommended that these canals be
spanned and that no piers be placed within the canal to preserve their historic function and integrity of
location, materials, design, workmanship, and association, which contribute to the resources’ NRHP
eligibility. Although the proposed project would impact the resources’ overall setting, this aspect of
integrity is not one of the character-defining features that contribute to the resources’ eligibility.
Additionally, the setting within the irrigation district has been heavily altered from its appearance during
100011499/100154

VI: Results

its period of significance by the disappearance of small truck farming operations and rural homesteads
and their replacement with large-scale commercial farming operations. Thus, the proposed project would
not impact any of the character-defining features of the NRHP-listed Louisiana-Rio Grande Canal
Company Irrigation System that contribute to its eligibility and that the proposed project would not pose
an adverse effect to the NRHP-listed resource under any applicable regulatory criteria. The HCRMA has
committed to continued coordination with the THC regarding avoidance of adverse effects to these
resources (see letter in Appendix J).
In addition to irrigation resources, historians documented one bridge (Resource 04), three single-family
dwellings (resources 01, 02A, and 03), and three domestic secondary structures (resources 02B–D)
(Appendix F) within the proposed ROW These resources are all of common design and lack known
historic or architectural/engineering significance. Resources 01, 02A–D, and 04 have been altered and no
longer possess sufficient historic integrity to merit inclusion in the NRHP, and no further consideration of
these resources is recommended under any applicable regulatory criteria.

Properties within the Section 106 APE
In addition to the historic resources survey of the proposed ROW, project historians examined an
expanded APE in areas where Section 404 permitting may be required and Section 106 may apply
(Appendix G). The APE selected for this survey included any parcel adjacent to the ROW at potential
Section 404 crossings. Historians documented a total of 13 additional historic-age resources in this
expanded APE. These include four standpipes associated with the Donna Irrigation District (Resources
SEC 404 01A–D), six standpipes associated with the NRHP-listed Louisiana-Rio Grande Canal Company
Irrigation District (Resources SEC 404 02A–F), one barn (SEC 404 03), and two single-family dwellings
(Section 404 04A–B). Resources SEC 404 02A–F are not contributing elements of the NRHP-eligible
irrigation district and they will not be directly impacted by the project. The remaining resources are of
common design and lack sufficient integrity and associative significance to merit inclusion in the NRHP.
No further consideration of the project under Section 106 is recommended,

VII. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On behalf of the HCRMA, PBS&J conducted an intensive linear cultural resources survey of the
proposed 14.7-mile Hidalgo IBTC roadway project south-southeast of McAllen, in Hidalgo County,
Texas. The proposed undertaking will consist of the construction of a tolled highway composed of up to
six travel lanes. The roadway would run from US 281 (Military Highway) at San Juan Road to US 83,
and from FM 493 to US 83. Currently, the majority of the project is located on property owned and
controlled by Hidalgo County and on private property for which Hidalgo County has obtained ROE. Only
one parcel was inaccessible at the time of the cultural resource investigations. The current archeological
investigations consisted of a background literature and records review, a historic standing structure
survey, geoarcheological investigations at the deep vertical APE locations, and an intensive pedestrian
survey with shovel testing of the accessible portions of the project area (approximately 14.1 miles). The
investigated portions of the project area covered roughly 677.7 acres of the approximate 688.7-acre total
project area. The extreme western portion of the current project falls within the limits of Section A of the
original Hidalgo Loop concept (CSJ #0921-02-172), which was investigated by PBS&J in January 2009.
The remaining investigations were conducted in July and August 2010 under Texas Antiquities Permit
5683.
The archeological background review revealed there are no prehistoric or historic archeological sites
documented within the project area prior to the current investigations and two previously conducted
archeological surveys contained portions of the project area. The previous surveys did not record any sites
within the IBTC project area. However, there are four previously recorded sites within 2 km of the project
area (41HG158, 41HG159, 41HG160, and 41HG230). None of the sites extend into the current IBTC
project area. The historic nonarcheological records review revealed one NRHP-listed property (the
Louisiana-Rio Grande Canal Company Irrigation System), one OTHM (the Jackson Ranch Church
Historic Marker), and no SALs within the proposed project ROW, 300-ft APE, or 1,300-ft study area. In
addition, there is one OTHM (the Jackson Ranch Church) and one Historic Texas Cemetery (Eli Jackson
Cemetery) within the IBTC project area.
The intensive archeological survey determined that the majority of the areas within the ROW are newly
plowed, newly harvested, or contained standing crops. In addition, several areas were extensively
disturbed by modern construction or were severely flooded. Two new historic archeological sites were
recorded during the survey (sites 41HG224 and 41HG237). Both sites consist of the remnants of a
possible historic occupation from the early to mid-twentieth century. Site 41HG224 is limited to concrete
slabs and assorted concrete features in disturbed context. However, no elements that could contribute to
the site’s potential for NRHP eligibility were observed within the present project area. Therefore, no
further investigation of this site was recommended in association with the proposed project. Site
41HG237 consists of two concrete slab foundations, a possible windmill concrete mount, and a water
retention tank in disturbed context similar to site 41HG224. An archival investigation into this site found
no indication of a building at the location prior to a 1954 aerial photograph. A 1961 road map displays a

schoolhouse as being located at the site. However, no evidence of a schoolhouse and no elements that
could contribute to the site’s potential for NRHP eligibility were observed within the present project area.
Therefore, no further investigation of this site was recommended in association with the proposed project.
Aside from the sites mentioned above, the archeological survey did not locate any cultural material other
than recent scattered trash in the project area. A total of 878 shovel tests were placed within the accessible
portions of the ROW. The additional shovel tests beyond the recommended shovel tests for the accessible
14.1-mile project area were located in the high probability areas along canals and roads. None of these
shovel tests encountered artifacts or features. In addition, geoarcheological investigations within the high
probability areas where the vertical APE is substantially deeper than accessible by shovel testing did not
encounter any artifacts or features.
The historic standing structures survey documented a total of 64 historic-age nonarcheological resources
within the proposed ROW and an additional 13 within the APE at Section 404 crossings. Of these, only
12 canals associated with the NRHP-listed Louisiana-Rio Grande Canal Company Irrigation District are
contributing the listed district. None of the other recorded resources appears to meet NRHP eligibility
criteria. The HCRMA has committed to continued coordination with the THC to avoid adverse effects to
the contributing canals. No further consideration of the project under any regulatory criteria is
recommended.

Exploratory Mechanical Trenching Report

EXPLORATORY MECHANICAL TRENCHING REPORT
by Robert Rowe and Julie Shipp
On October 19–20, 2010, exploratory mechanical trenching was conducted for the International proposed
Hidalgo Trade Bridge Corridor (IBTC) in Hidalgo County, Texas. A total of eight backhoe trenches were
excavated at proposed bridge locations within archeological high probability areas (HPAs). Trenches
were 1 meter (m) (3 feet [ft]) wide, 5 m (17 ft), long, and 1.2 m (4 ft) deep. No cultural material was
located during the excavations. Below are the detailed descriptions of the soils with photographs of the
trench profiles and general settings.

TRENCH 1
Trench 1 was located at the northeast corner of the intersection of San Juan Road and U.S. Highway (US)
281 (Military Highway), and oriented north-south. The trench was in the corner of an agricultural field
was fallow at that time. The soil at this location is mapped as Cameron silty clay. Cameron soils are deep,
moderately well drained, moderately slowly permeable calcareous soils that formed in alluvium.
Taxonomically, they are classified as hyperthermic Vertic Haplustolls, which are more or less freely
drained Mollisols found in subhumid to semiarid climates. They are carbonate-rich, and are characterized
by having cracks 5 millimeters (mm) to 10 centimeters (cm) wide. They occur on Pleistocene to Holocene
age landforms. The soil pedon observed within this trench consisted of an Ap of 30 cm (12 inches) of
silty clay, gray (7.5YR 6/1) very hard, crumbly, with moderate root disturbance; A1 between 30 to 45 cm
(12 to 18 inches) of moist silty clay, (7.5YR 6/1), few fragments of freshwater clam shells, pedogenic
calcareous deposits with a smooth boundary; B between 450 to 120 cm (18 to 48 inches) of moist clay,
brown (7.5YR 5/2), structureless with no roots or other inclusions.

Photograph 2: Trench 1 setting, facing southeast

TRENCH 2
Trench 2 was to be placed along the southern side of the drainage canal along San Juan Road between
Anaya and Las Milpas roads. However, the area was heavily saturated with standing water among grasses
and vegetation adjacent to the canal so the trench could not be excavated.

TRENCH 3A
Trench 3a was excavated on the north side of Dicker Road (Farm-to-Market [FM] 3072) between I Road
and Stewart Road, oriented east-west. The trench was dug on the edge of a freshly plowed agricultural
field. Soil at the location is mapped as Harlingen clay, which is a Vertisol, and is described as very
clayey, very fine, smectitic, hyperthermic Sodic Haplusterts. Harlingen soils are very deep, moderately
well drained and very slowly permeable soils that form in clayey sediments. They occur on nearly level
stream terraces. The soil pedon observed within this trench consisted of an Ap of 20 cm (8 inches) of silty
clay, gray (7.5YR 5/1) very hard, crumbly, with moderate root disturbance; A between 20 to 40 cm (8 to
16 inches) of silty clay, gray (7.5YR 6/1) moist, with a moderate blocky structure with a diffuse wavy
boundary; B between 70 to 120 cm (16 to 28 inches) of clay, brown (7.5YR 4/2), moist with prominent
slickensides with a diffuse wavy boundary; B1 of between 28 and 48 inches of clay, gray (7.5YR 5/1),
very moist but firm easily filmed with a few pedogenic calcite deposits throughout. The eastern end of the
trench had evidence of a large burned root trace with small charcoal flecks.

TRENCH 3B
Trench 3b was excavated on the north side of Dicker Road (FM 3072) between I Road and Stewart Road,
oriented east-west. The trench was dug on the edge of a freshly plowed agricultural field. The soil at the
location is mapped as Harlingen clay. The soil pedon observed within this trench consisted of an Ap of
15 cm (6 inches) of silty clay, gray (7.5YR 6/1) very hard, crumbly, with moderate root disturbance; A
between 15 to 20 cm (6 to 8 inches) of silty clay, gray (7.5YR 6/1) moist, with a moderate blocky
structure with a diffuse wavy boundary; B between 20 to 115 cm (8 to 46 inches) of clay, dark gray
(7.5YR 4/1), very moist with prominent slickensides with a diffuse wavy boundary, there are a few
pedogenic calcite deposits throughout this stratum; B1 of between 115 to 120 cm (46 to 48 inches) of
clay, brown (7.5YR 5/2), very moist. All strata of soils within this trench displayed freshwater clam and
turritella shells.

TRENCH 4
Trench 4 was excavated at the northeast corner of Stewart Road (FM 2557) and Dicker Road (FM 3071),
oriented east-west. The trench was dug in the corner of an agricultural field. Soil at the location is mapped
as Harlingen clay. The soil pedon observed within this trench consisted of an Ap of 15 cm (6 inches) of
silty clay, reddish gray (5YR 5/2) very hard, crumbly, with moderate root disturbance; B between 15 to
45 cm (6 to 18 inches) of silty clay, brown (7.5 YR 5/3) moist, with a moderate blocky structure with a
diffuse wavy boundary, and moderate small root disturbance; B1 between 45 to 120 cm (18 to 48 inches)
of clay, brown (7.5YR 5/3), very moist with prominent slickensides with a diffuse wavy boundary, few
pedogenic calcite deposits throughout this stratum, water seepage along bottom of trench; All stratum of
soils within this trench displayed freshwater clam and turritella shells.

TRENCH 5
Trench 5 was excavated at the northeast corner of Dicker Road (FM 3071) and Alamo Road (FM 907),
oriented north-south. The trench was dug in the corner of a fallow agricultural field. Soil at the location is
mapped as Runn silty clay. Runn soils are deep, moderately well drained and slowly permeable soils that
formed in calcareous clayey sediments. They occur on nearly level stream terraces. Taxonomically, Runn
soils are classified as hyperthermic Torretic haplusterts. These are more or less freely drained Inceptisols
that receive dominantly summer precipitation. They are calcareous at shallow depths and have a Bk or
calcic horizon. The soil pedon observed within this trench consisted of an Ap of 20 cm (8 inches) of silty
clay, light reddish gray (2.5YR 7/1) moderate medium granular structure, hard, with moderate root
disturbance; A between 20 to 28 cm (8 to 11 inches) of silty clay, reddish gray (2.5YR 5/1) moist, with a
weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure with a smooth boundary, and moderate small root
disturbance; Bk between 28 to 35 cm (11 to 14 inches) of clay, reddish brown (5YR 5/3), very moist with
prominent slickensides with threads of pedogenic calcite with a clear wavy boundary; B between 35 to
120 cm (14 and 48 inches) of clay, reddish brown (5YR 5/3), very moist with prominent slickensides, no
roots or other inclusions. Heavy water seepage throughout the bottom of the trench. All strata of soils
within this trench displayed freshwater clam and turritella shells.

Re: Project review under the Antiquities Code of Texas and National Historic Preservation Act,
Antiquities Permit #5683, Hidalgo IBTC Survey, Revised Draft Report (Hidalgo Co. Regional
Mobility Authority)
Dear Mr. Chavez:
Thank you for your correspondence concerning the above referenced project. This letter presents
the comments of the Executive Director of the Texas Historical Commission (rHC), the State
Historic Preservation Office and the agency responsible for administering the Antiquities Code of
Texas. We have completed our review of the Revised Draft Report for .\ntiquities Permit# 5683,
and we concur with the conclusions and recommendations.
With regard to final report production, please provide documentation of how the listed elements will
be avoided per your recommendations so that our Division of Architecture staff can assess the
effect of the project. For the identified historic irrigation district elements (i.e. canals, standpipes,
gates, etc.), please include on the maps and/ or Historic Resource Documentation Forms which
irrigation districts they are a part of. We need to understand exactly how the resources that are part
of the listed HCID N o. 2 will be affected.
Please also advise the Hidalgo County Regional M; bility Authority that they must send us written
verification that they will follow PBS&J's recommendation that the 11 eligible canals will be
preserved and protected by spanning those canals, and that no piers will be placed within the banks
of the canals. Once we have this commitment letter and the associated data, the Authority will be
able proceed with roadway developments relative to the THC's jurisdiction under the Antiquities
Code of Texas and National Historic Preservation Act.
Thank you for your cooperation in this state review process, and for your efforts to preserve the
irreplaceable heritage of Texas. We will await receipt of a final report that contains the above
referenced information. If you have any questions please contact Mark H. Denton at (512)
463-5711 or Linda Henderson at 463-5851.

Re: HCRMA International Bridge Trade Corridor (IBTC) Project
Request for Concurrence
Dear Mr. Denton and Ms. Henderson:
This coITespondence is in reference to your recent review of cultural resource
studies under the Antiquities Code of Texas and National Historic Preservation
Act, Antiquities Permit #5683, for the Hidalgo Internat ional Bridge Trade Corridor
(JBTC) Project. The purpose of this Jetter is to:
I . Inform you of recent project limit changes due to changes in project funding
2. Provide additional documentation regarding potential project impacts to the
NRHP-listed Hidalgo County Irrigation District #2 (HCID #2), including
our commitment to adhere to the reco mmendations of PBS&J historians
regarding preservation and protection of the associated canals and to
continue to coordinate with your office regarding these resources during the
ongoing planning process.
3. Request concurrence that the remainder of the project with the exception of
the outstanding trench locations, inaccessible inundated parcel, and
inundated Temp Site 2 location has been cleared to proceed from an
archeological standpo int.
With regard to the project limit changes, the original project limits, as presented in
the September IBTC Cultural Resources Survey Draft report, extended from US 83
Expressway (0.5 mile east of FM L423) to approximately l.O mile east of Spur 600,
and to FM 493, approximately l.5 miles north of US 28 1 (Military Highway), a
length of approximately 15.4 miles (Figure 1). Recently, it has been decided that
two elements within the limits of the original project should be treated separately
from the proposed IBTC, and they wi ll be further developed as an independent
project. Therefore, the proposed US 28 1 overpass at San Juan Road and the Border
Safety Inspection Facility (BSIF) connector will mo ve forward as a stand-alone
project (Figure 2).
As a result, the poriion of the project that included the proposed US 28 I overpass

Admini strative Agent: Lower Rio Grande Valley Development Council, Kenneth N. Jones. Jr.. Executive Director
31 I Nrnih 15'" Street McAllen. Texas 7850 1-4 705 - Telephone: (956) 682-348 1 Fax : (956 ) 63 1-46 70

right of way (ROW), located along US 281 approximately 0.5 mile east and 0.6
mile west of the US 281 /San Juan Road intersection, and the BSIF connector
ROW, located approximately 0.2 mile south and approximately 0.6 mile southwest
of the US 281 /San Juan Road intersection, are no longer part of the proposed IBTC
project. These areas require no further consideration as a part of the current review
process under Antiquities Permit #5683 (see Figure 2).
These changes result in a 73 .2-acre reduction in the area of proposed new ROW
and an associated reduction in impacts for the IBTC project. The new limits of the
project extend from US 83 Expressway (0.5 mile east of FM 1423) to the
intersection of San Juan Road and US 281 (Military Highway), and to FM 493 ,
approximately 1.5 miles north of US 28 1 (Military Highway), a length of
approximately 14.7 mi les (Figure 3). As a result of the project limit reductions, five
historic-age nonarcheological resources are now no longer within the APE of the
proposed IBTC project. These include three iITigation resources (Sites 08Z, 08AA,
and 08BB), a drainage ditch (Site 05), and an Official State Historic Marker
commemorating the Jackson Ranch Church (Site 06). Discussion of these sites will
be removed from the updated cultural resources survey report. No recorded
archeological sites were located within this area.
Secondly, the HCRMA commits to the following with regard to the components of
the NRHP-listed iITigation system located within the proposed ROW of the IBTC
project (see Figure 4):
1. The HCRMA will continue coordination with the THC as the project

advances in planning stages regarding areas where the IBTC intersects
contributing components of the NRHP-listed HCID#2.
2. Generally, in any areas where the canal crosses an existing roadway via a
nonhistoric-age drainage culvert or bridge, the bridge or drainage culvert
may require replacement or expansion. The HCRMA commits to coordinate
regarding these replacements and expansions to ensure that they will not
adversely impact any of the NRHP-listed canals.
3. In areas where the proposed IBTC will cross contributing canals where an
existing bridge or culvert is not in place, the HCRMA proposes to span the
canals and will not place any piers or other structures within the canal
banks.
As more detailed plans become available regarding proposed roadway construction
at the contributing elements of the NRHP-listed irrigation system, these plans will
be made available to the THC, and the HCRMA will consult with the THC to avoid
adverse impacts to the listed irrigation system. The attached map depicts the
location of the standpipes, a well, and irrigation canals associated with the NRHP­
listed irrigation system in relation to the proposed IBTC ROW (See Figure 4). The
final cultural resources survey report will include the requested updates to the
resource documentation forms and resource location maps with regard to the
irrigation resources as requested in the October 16, 2010 review letter received
from your office.
Finally, the HCRMA requests concurrence that no further archeological
investigations are needed with the exception of the outstanding trench locations,

3 I I No11h 15'" Street - Mc Alle n. Texas 78501-4705 - Telephone: (956) 682-348 1 Fax : (956) 63 1-4670

inaccessible parcel, and inundated Temp Site 2 location (see Figure 5). In addition,
HCRMA is requesting concurrence that construction is cleared to proceed with
regard to archeological resources aside from the locations outlined above. The
additional invest igations at these locations will include:
4. Geoarchaeological trenching investigations in high probability areas where
the vertical APE is substantially deeper than accessible by shovel testing
5. Evaluation and recommendations regarding Temp Site 2 pending site
recordation once the area is no longer flooded
6. Further investigations of the inaccessible parcel near the La Cruz Resaca
once permissible access is received
The results of the additional investigations will be included in a revised version of
the cultural resources survey rep01i and will be submitted for your review. Figure 6
(attached) depicts all shovel test locations excavated during the January 15 - 30,
2009 and July 22 - 29, 2010 archeological field survey efforts. Please contact us if
you require any further documentation or have any questions regarding the IBTC
project.

On October 19 and 20, 2010, and again on March 6, 2013, exploratory mechanical trenching was
conducted within portions of Section A of the proposed Hidalgo Loop Project archeological APE that
now lie within the current SH 365 APE in Hidalgo County, Texas. Trenching was proposed at eight
locations (A–H) where construction impacts or vertical APE are expected to exceed the depth
accessible by shovel testing (i.e., >1 meter [m]) within archeological high probability areas. Several
locations were disregarded based on results of the pedestrian survey, which found these areas
unsuitable for exploratory trenching. A total of seven backhoe trenches were excavated.

All trenches were excavated within the Rio Grande floodplain. Trenches 1 and 2 were excavated in a
very level area mostly used for growing commercial vegetable crops. The soils in this area are
recorded as Runn series. These are deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that
formed in calcareous clayey sediments. Trenches 3–6 were excavated in a hay field located between
two man-made levees. The soils here are mapped as Arents. Arents do not have diagnostic horizons
because they have been deeply mixed by plowing, spading, or other methods of moving by humans.
Trench 7 was excavated in an agricultural field that was fallow at the time of survey. The soil at this
location is mapped as Cameron silty clay, which is a Vertisol, and is described as being clayey over
loamy, mixed, active, hyperthermic Vertic Haplustolls.

Trenches were 1 m (3 feet [ft]) wide, 5 m (17 ft) long, and 1.2 m (4 ft) deep in all areas unless
modified for safety concerns. Excavation was conducted using a rubber-wheeled backhoe and
qualified operator. During the course of the trenching, no cultural material or features of historical
concern were located. All excavations were monitored by a qualified archeologist. Below are the
details of each trench and photographs of the profiles.

Trench Location A
Trench Location A was proposed along the southern side of the Union Pacific Railroad tracks east of
the intersection of Military Road/FM 494 and the Union Pacific Railroad tracks. However, the area
was heavily saturated with standing water among an orchard at this location. Due to these
conditions, no trenches were excavated here.

Trench Location B

Trench Location B was proposed within the main floodway channel between South 37th Street and
SP 115/South 23rd Street/South Depot Road. Trenches 4–6 were excavated here.

Trench 17
Location (UTM): Zone 14 573675E 2891809N NAD83

Comments: Trench is situated within the Hackney Lake Inlet floodway. The top 48 cm are modern
sediments deposited by the Rio Grande since establishment of the Hackney Lake Inlet floodway in
the 1930s. The deposits between 48 and 118 cmbs are introduced fill, presumably dating to the
development of the levees for the Hackney Lake floodway. The lowest deposit is a truncated natural
alluvial deposit, presumably of Late Pleistocene age based on the degree of calcic horizon
development it exhibits (stage II morphology). An in situ burned surface was observed at the
interface between Pleistocene alluvium and the introduced fill and appears to be a modern feature.

Comments: The top 48 cm of this trench is Late Holocene or modern alluvium. The radiocarbon age
on the hearth observed in Zones 2 and 3 would suggest modern, but I suspect the top of this basin
has been truncated by the plow and is not accurately represented in the profile. The deposit is
consistent with the distal overbank facies of the Late Holocene Alluvium. The deposit below 48 cm

Trench 11.5
Location (UTM): Zone 14 571540E 2891726N NAD83

Comments: Trench was situated on shoulder slope overlooking the Resaca, and exhibits near
channel overbank deposits most likely associated with flood waters originating within this channel,
or flowing down it following abandonment. Unlike Trench 11.0, which was in a similar setting, this
trench exhibited fairly prominent beds that facilitated observation of the numerous cultural
features revealed by this exposure. Six features were observed within this short 4-x-1.4-m-wide x
1.2-m-deep trench. The most intense were present in the south end of the trench where two pits
were observed (F8a and F8c), the lower of which truncated an in situ burned surface (hearth) and
had a thin bed of charcoal and burned earth laden sediment that filled this depression from the
west.

Eight soil matrix samples from cultural resources survey in Hidalgo County,
Texas were submitted for flotation processing and identification and analysis of plant
remains. The eight samples represent 7.45 cubic decimeters of soil matrix from six
trenches.
Site setting
Hidalgo County is located in the South Texas Plains vegetation area (Gould
1962). Much of the land today has been developed for human occupation or is in
cultivation. For most of the Holocene, the land that is now Hidalgo County would have
been a savannah, an area of mixed grasslands and woodlands on deeper soils than those
remaining today. Woodlands would have been composed of typical South Texas brush
species but with more of the larger trees. Common woody species are shown in Table
D.1. Near the Rio Grande, floodplains and associated wetlands such as resacas and
marshes would have supported Montezuma baldcypress (Taxodium mucronatum, also
called sabino or ahuehete), patches of palm (Sabal mexicana), and other useful plants
such as southern cattail (Typha domingensis) and spikerushes (Eleocharis spp.).

Mean annual precipitation in Hidalgo County during the period 1951-1980 was
23.0 inches (584 mm). Winters are generally dry. Warm season precipitation peaks in
August and September, with a smaller peak in May and June. The frost-free season in

Macrobotanical Analysis 5/9/14, p.

Hidalgo County averages 327 days and runs from February 7 through December 8 (NFIC
1987:237-238).

Methods
Flotation samples were processed according to the TAS Field School method
(Bush 2012, 2013). Light fractions were decanted into mesh with triangular openings of
0.3 x 0.3 x 0.5 mm. Heavy fractions were poured through mesh with square openings of
1.0 mm.
The flotation samples were sorted according to standard procedures (Pearsall
2000). Once dry, heavy fractions were examined under a stereoscopic light microscope at
7-45 X magnification for identifiable bone, chert flakes, and carbonized plant remains.
All heavy fractions contained gastropods. Identifiable bone was present only in the
Trench 23.0, Sample 1 heavy fraction, and chert flakes were present only in Trench 39.0
(41HG253), Sample 1. Chert and bone were removed for examination by other
specialists. Carbonized botanical remains were present only in the Trench 41.0
(41HG255), Sample 3 heavy fraction. They were removed and added to the light fraction
for that sample.
To facilitate identification, flotation light fractions were size-sorted through a
stack of graduated geologic mesh. All carbonized botanical materials that did not pass
through the No. 10 mesh (2 mm square openings) were completely sorted, counted,
weighed, recorded, and labeled. Materials that fell through the 2 mm mesh were
examined under a stereoscopic microscope at 7-45 X magnification for carbonized
botanical remains. Although wood charcoal in this smaller size category is not typically
removed from residue, any potentially identifiable fragment was removed for all samples
except the Trench 23, Sample 1 due to the small quantity of charcoal available in those
samples. Identifiable materials were removed from residue, counted, weighed, recorded,
and labeled. Weights of carbonized seeds and leaf fragments were usually too light to
register on the scale and are not reported here. Uncarbonized seeds and carbonized insect
pellets (“frass”) in the light fractions were identified and recorded on a presence/absence
basis on laboratory forms. All weights were taken on an Ohaus Scout II 200 x 0.01 g
electronic balance.
For each sample, wood charcoal fragments were selected at random for
identification until 20 fragments were examined (or all fragments in cases where fewer
than 20 were present). Fragments were snapped to reveal a clean transverse section and
examined under a stereoscopic microscope at 28-180 X magnification. When necessary,
tangential or radial sections were examined for ray seriation, presence of spiral
thickenings, types and sizes of intervessel pitting, and other minute characteristics that
can only be seen at the higher magnifications of this range.
All samples were subject to radiocarbon protocols during identification to retain
suitability for radiocarbon dating. Geological sieves were cleaned between samples.

Macrobotanical Analysis 5/9/14, p.

Samples were sorted on freshly cleaned glassware and handled only with vinyl gloves
and metal forceps. Contact with paper and other plant products was avoided. Data were
recorded using plastic mechanical pencils.
Botanical materials were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level by
comparison to materials in the Macrobotanical Analysis comparative collection and
through the use of standard reference works (e.g., Core et al. 1979; Davis 1993; Hoadley
1990; InsideWood 2004; Martin and Barkley 1961; Musil 1963; Panshin and de Zeeuw
1980; Wheeler 2011). Plant nomenclature follows the PLANTS Database (USDA, NRCS
2014).
Results and Discussion
Materials recovered in the flotation samples are shown in Table D.2. The table
includes counts and weights of carbonized plants from the flotation samples as well as
some non-plant material. Weights for the residue of the flotation light and heavy fractions
are provided, and uncarbonized seeds are shown on a presence/absence basis.
Uncarbonized plant remains
Uncarbonized seeds on archeological sites usually represent seeds of modern
plants that originated at the surface and have made their way into the soil either through
their own dispersal mechanisms or by faunalturbation, floralturbation, or argilliturbation
(Bryant 1985:51-52; Miksicek 1987:231-232). In all except the driest areas of North
America, uncarbonized plant material on open-air sites can be assumed to be of modern
origin unless compelling evidence suggests otherwise (Lopinot and Brussell 1982;
Miksicek 1987:231). Uncarbonized seeds are not common in these relatively deep
flotation samples from Hidalgo County, a fact that supports their presumed origin at the
modern surface. Uncarbonized roots and rootlets were noted in light fraction residue.
These are also interpreted as modern, most likely the roots of vegetation destroyed during
excavation.
Carbonized plants
Wood charcoal was the most common plant type recovered. One hundred thirtyseven wood charcoal fragments were recovered (1.28 g), with identification attempted for
78 fragments, of which 55 could be identified to the level of the botanical family or
genus. Identifiable wood consisted mostly of a ring-porous member of the genus Acacia
(n=31). As noted in Table D.1, there are four common species of Acacia in Hidalgo
County, but much of the wood charcoal here is probably catclaw (A. greggii). A single
fragment of diffuse-porous wood charcoal identified to the Legume family is probably
some other species of acacia, but it may be kidneywood or a mimosa. Eleven fragments
of wood charcoal were identifiable as mesquite, probably honey mesquite but possibly
screwbean mesquite. An additional eleven fragments were either mesquite or acacia.

Carbonized seeds and leaf fragments were present in Trench 23, Sample 1 and
Trench 21 (41HG251), Sample 2. The seeds consisted of several species in the grass
family (n=37), sheep sorrel achenes (n=12), one specimen of Indian mallow, and one
seed too poorly preserved to be identified. All but two of the seeds were from the Trench
23, Sample 1, a sample that is unusual in several respects. In addition to the seeds,
delicate fragments of a carbonized dicot leaf were recovered in this sample. Such
preservation from prehistoric times is rare. Similarly, sheep sorrel is an Old World plant,
so its presence indicates a carbonization date after the 15th century. Small bones were also
preserved in the sample, but not in other samples from this project. In addition, some
seeds from Trench 23, Sample 1were incompletely carbonized, with some grass seeds
having brown embryo scars and the interior of some sheep sorrel achenes also brown.
Finally, three of the 18 wood charcoal fragments in this sample were mesquite, a species
that increases relative to other species under grazing pressure. Taken together, the
unusual aspects of the assemblage in Trench 23, Sample 1 suggest either unusual
preservation conditions or a more recent origin of the deposit. The two seeds in Trench
21 (41HG251), Sample 2 appear to be fully carbonized, but the taxon overlap with
Trench 23, Sample 1 (mesquite wood charcoal, grass family seed) suggests the Trench
21(41HG251), Sample 2 should be interpreted with caution.
Summary
Eight small flotation samples from Hidalgo County yielded acacia and mesquite
wood charcoal. Carbonized leaf fragments and carbonized and semi-carbonized seeds
were also recovered, but these are likely recent in origin.

Basis for Time: Lack of diagnostic materials recovered
Single Component: False

Basis for Component: Lack of diagnostic materials recovered

Component Unknown: True

Cultural Features:
None observed
Approximate Site Size: 85 meters N-S by 25 meters E-W
Basis for Determination: Extent of surface materials
Top of Deposit Below Surface: na
Basis for Determination: Shovel tests; no sub-surface materials encountered
Thickness of Deposit: na
Basis for Determination: Shovel tests; no sub-surface materials encountered
Artifactual Materials Present:
The site was initially located based upon its surface expression, which is comprised of a light scatter of lithic
materials. The site area was then subject to an intensive surface inspection which revealed the following cultural
materials: 1 fire cracked rock, 10 pieces of lithic debitage, and 1 biface. A total of 7 shovel tests were then excavated
across the site area to determine the horizontal and vertical extent, all of which were culturally sterile.
Discussion of Site:
Temporary site EF27 represents at least one prehistoric occupation period of unknown origin. The presence of lithic
tools and debitage suggests that lithic tools were produced, utilzied, and/or maintained at the site. The paucity of a
larger artifact assemblage, any intact cultural features, and sub-surface materials suggests the site has suffered from
erosional degradation and remains in poor condition.

Time·Period of Occupation:
Historic; Early to Mid-Twentieth Century
Basis for Time: Diagnostic cultural materials observed
Single Component: False

Multiple Component: False

Component Unknown: True

Basis for Component: Overlapping timeframe of artifacts
Cultural Features:
2 cement foundations, 1 brick cistern
Approximate Site Size: 100 meters N-S by 100 meters E-W
Basis for Determination: Extent of surface and sub-surface cultural materials
Top of Deposit Below Surface: 0-10cmbs
Basis for Determination: Shovel tests; artifacts recovered beginning at Level 1 (0-10cmbs)
Thickness of Deposit: 60cm
Basis for Determination: Shovel tests; artifacts recovered in Levels 1 through 6 (0-60cmbs)
Artifactual Materials Present:
The site was initially located based upon its surface expression, which includes 1 cement foundation measuring 35m
by 15 m, 1 cement u-shaped walkway measuring 15m in length, 1 dry laid cistern comprised of locally made brick,
and a light scatter of historic artifacts on the ground surface. A total of 6 shovel tests were then excavated across the
site area to determine the horizontal and vertical extent, 4 of which were positive tor cultural materials yielding the
following artifacts in levels 1 through 6 (0-60cmbs): brown glass, colorless glass, green glass, blue glass,
colorless-solarized glass, refined earthenware ceramics, wood shingles, carbon samples, various metal artifacts,
fauna!, brick, cement, and plastic.
Discussion of Site:
Temporary site HSJS1 represents at least one historic occupation period dating to the Early to Mid-Twentieth century.
The only temporally sensitive artifact recovered is solarized glass, which dates from 1880 to 1918. The site area is
also littered with modern debris including beer bottles, ceramic light fixtures, cinder blocks, and pvc pipe. Multiple push
piles containing construction materials were also observed around the site area, indicating the clearing and destruction
of the original structures. The site area has been severely degraded by mechanical clearing activities.

Description of Location
Site is situated within a cultivated field and a Bermuda Grass hay field. Site lies adjacent to and within an
abandoned channel (or Resaca) of the Rio Grande. From the intersection of West Military Highway and South
Industrial Boulevard, proceed south on Industrial Boulevard J km until the road ends in a cul de sac. Follow the dirt
road at the end of the cul de sac south, and when it splits at the start of the agricultural field into an East-West dirt
road, bear right (west) about 30 m, and then immediately left (south) , and follow the dirt road that divides two
agricultural fields south about 220 m, at which point the road passes a stand pipe, which lies at the northern edge of
the site.

Cultural Features
A pit hearth (Feature 1) was discovered in Trench 11.0 at a depth of 40-60 cmbs; Feature 2, an in situ burnt surface
originally thought to be a hearth but possible a burnt structure was found at a depth of 35 cm in trench 11.1
immediately beneath the plow zone, and had a large piece of burnt daub on top of it; Feature 3 was an in situ
burned area exposed on trench floor at 35 cm bs, which based on shape is most likely a burnt tree; Feature 4 was a
linear band of dark colored soil exposed on trench floor at 40 cmbs, but was subsequently determined to be a
topographic variation in base of the plow zone; Feature 5 was a circular area of darker colored soil (presumably
charcoal stained); Feature 6: was noted on floor of trench @ 50 cm bs initially thought to be a pit but was later
determined to be scatter of charcoal and burnt earth subsequently cut by a sand bed; Feature 7: was a charred post
like object exposed on the floor of the trench @ 90 cm bs, approximately 2.8 m from the south end of the trench.

Feature 8: was a complex of three anomalies:
Feature 8a: A pit feature between 20 and 50 cm bs located in SE comer of the trench that was filled with charcoal
and burnt earth;
Feature 8b: A narrow, conical charcoal and burnt earth filled soil anomaly that protruded down from base of 8a,
that looks like a burnt tree.
Feature 8c: A very subtle structure that looked like a broad shallow pit that cuts Feature 13 and that has a thin bed
of burnt earth and charcoal dipping into it from the west.
Feature 9: a shallow pit 52 cm wide in profile on West trench wall the top of which was about 30 cm bs, filled with
Rabdotus shells, and a trace of burnt earth, charcoal and bone.
Feature 10: appears to be a large pit in northeast comer of the trench, -90 cm N-S and >40 cm E-W, contains earth
of similar color to outside but includes patches of burnt earth and charcoal; noted in profile because it cuts two
distinct sand beds.
Feature 11: a shallow pit exposed on west trench wall, the top of this feature lies @46 cm bs, and base is about 56
cm bs, and the pit is filled with reddened burnt earth in chunks up to 1 cm in diameter. This pit is about 50 cm
wide in the west wall profile.
Feature 12: a patch of charcoal stained earth exposed on the floor at a depth of about 50 cm, on the step at
northwest end of trench ; exposure was somewhat strange and complicated seeing its actual geometry but this is
most likely a pit, and based on fragments of in situ reddened earth probably had a fire kindled within it. On floor
this was 60 cm Ion E-W and >30 cm wide N-S.
Feature 13: was an in situ burned surface (small hearth?) slightly greater than 50 cm wide and at a depth of -1
meter, exposed on south end wall of the trench. This reddened reaction rim was about 8 cm thick and cut on east
side by feature 8c.
Feature 14: an in situ bum exposed on the floor of the trench at 115 cm bs and extending to base of trench @127

No durable artifacts were noted, with exception of bones found within the Resaca deposits within trench 11.6. A
large fragment of burnt daub was found within Feature 2 in the uppermost component. The absence of durable
artifacts is overshadowed by the presence of multiple features such as pits and in situ burned surfaces (delineated
by continuous reddened reaction rims) that appear to be hearths.

Discussion of Site
Site appears to be a series of short term camps located on the edge of a Resaca, that were subsequently buried by
flood deposits.

Description of Location
Site is situated within a cultivated field adjancent and north of a linear borrow pit that in tum lies adjacent to a levee
bordering the north side of the Hackney Lake Inlet. Site lies a short distance east of an abandoned channel (or
Resaca) of the Rio Grande.From the intersection of West Military Highway and South Industrial Boulevard, proceed
south on Industrial Boulevard I km until the road ends in a cul de sac. Follow the dirt road at the end of the cul de
sac south, and when it splits at the start of the agricultural field into an East-West dirt road, bear right (west) about
30 m, and then immediately left (south), and follow the dirt road that divides two agricultural fields south about 220
m, at which point the road passes a stand pipe. At the stand pipe the road splits, bear left (southeast) and follow the
road about 140 m until it again bends to left and parallels the northern edge of a broad depression (borrow pit).
Follow the dirt road about 50 m to the southern side of the site.

[ Component Unknown

Basis for Component
This site appears to have one very obvious occupation between 80 and 100 cm below surface, and traces of
occupations between 40-50 cm bs and again around 130 cm bs.
Cultural Features
Feature 1 was a possible post mold (17 x 19 cm) that appeared on floor of trench 12.1 around 70 cm bs and
persisted in same spot for - 40 cm with the fill trending from light colored at top where first discovered to darker
colored with depth.
•Feature 2 was a pit (70 cm wide x 45 cm deep) exposed on the west wall of trench 12.1 that contained fragments
of burnt earth. This pit cut the occupation surface around 70 cm bs.
• Feature 3 was a broad, shallow pit containing numerous small fragments of burnt earth. This feature was about I
m wide and 1- cm deep and appeared to be located immediately beneath the main occupation, starting about 100

cm bs, in trench 12.1 .
• Features 4 and 5 are sand filled depressions exposed on west wall of trench 12.1 that cut into the occupation zone
(Stratigraphic zone 7) and these may be scour-related features. Unlike Feature 2, which has fill with burnt earth,
these two have clean sand fill and are formed by cutting through the occupation zone. Possibly natural features.
• Feature 6 was an irregular shaped patch of charcoal stained earth exposed on floor of trench 12.2 @ 52 cm bs,
approximately 25 x 35 cm in diameter, 1.6-2. 1 m from the south end of the trench. Possibly a natural feature.
•Feature 7 was located about 77 cm below surface in trench 12.2 and consisted of a roughly circular area of
charcoal stained earth 26x25 cm in diameter and located 5.4-5.6m from southeast end of trench. Possibly a natural
feature.
• Feature 8 presented as one quarter of a roughly circular patch of dark colored soil with burnt earth and charcoal,
that once trench 12.3 was completed, was noted to be a pit that originated at the occupation surface about 80 cmbs
and was -22 cm deep.
• Feature 9 is a freshwater mussel shell workshop, located between 2 and 3 m north of the SE end of trench 12.3, at
a depth of approximately 100 cm. Numerous small pieces of cut mussel shell were observed.
• Feature 10 was an elongate patch of dark colored earth containing small fragments of burnt earth and charcoal
that was exposed on the floor of trench 12.3 at 120 cm bs, and extended into the east trench wall. Along its long
axis this feature was 1.1 m long and about 50 cm wide perpendicular to that.
•Feature 11 was a linear, ditch-like soil anomaly that cut diagonally across trench 12.3 from NW to SE and was
filled with dense compacted clay. This feature originated at the base of the plow zone and extended to a depth of
90 cm and below it the soil was much drier. The dense compaction of this deposit is consistent with filling with
aid of modem heavy equipment. This may be a filed in old acequia.
• Feature 12 is a pit feature exposed west wall of trench 12.4 between 40 and 70 cm bs and associated with a
probable occupation zone between 40-50 cm bs. The pit was 1.3 m wide 25-30 cm deep and contained I 0-15 cm of
dark colored fill with charcoal and burnt earth, and then was filled in by a thicker wodge of flood sand associated
with bed that buried the occupation surface.
• Feature 13 is a complex suite of things located on the north and east walls of the trench. Trench 12.4 was
terminated short (@ 4 m long) to avoid removing all of this feature. The feature consists of what appear to be two
pits, one superimposed upon the other, cut into the zone 8 occupation surface, and on either side of the pits within
zone 8 were in situ burnt (reddened) surfaces (presumably hearths).

This concentration was approximately 1 min diameter and about 10 cm thick and consisted of snails stacked upon
one another at least 6 deep and mixed with small amounts of burned earth and charcoal. A one gallon bulk sample
from Feature 1 was floated by Dr. Leslie Bush and from the heavy fraction 6 flakes were recovered. A piece of
hardwood charcoal from this feature yielded a radiocarbon age of 1530±30 (Beta 370066).
• Feature 2 was an ill-defined area of darker colored earth that contained large burnt clay balls including one that
was > 10 cm in diameter. This feature was noted on the floor of trench 39.3 around 70-80 cmbs.
•Feature 3 was first noted on the floor of trench 39.3 around 80 cm bs and is an elongate pit that cut across the

trench floor from northeast to southwest and ranged from about 70 to 100 cm wide. Fill of the pit is darker colored
than the surrounding matrix and contains burnt earth, charcoal and clods of dirt.

Approximate Site Size Approximately 50 x 50 m
Basis for Determination Trench excavations. Six trenches (5 m long x 1.4 m wide x 1.3 m deep) were excavat
Top of Deposit Below Surface around 20 cmbs

Bottom of Deposit 122 cmbs
Basis for Determination Observations made from trench walls
Artifactual Materials Observed
Six flakes were observed in the heavy fraction of the bulk sample collected from Feature 1. No others were
observed.
Discussion of Site
Although there appear to be four components to the site, the occupation between 70-80 cm had three features (a
snail shell dump, a large elongate pit, and a possible hearth) and appears to be significant. Although we failed to
see any artifacts in the field, the flotation sample of snaily matrix from Feature 1 contained 6 small flakes, and this
may be illustrative of the size of material present in the site.

Research Value
Considerable. The main occupation has features. The lower components are also discrete, sealed occupation
surfaces and may provide new information on the prehistory of this region.

Further Investigations
Site should be tested, and given the lithic-poor landscape, some provision should b made to search for small lithic
debris (microdebitage).

Site is situated within a canal in-igated bermuda grass hayfield inside the Hackney Lake Inlet floodway. The levee
forming the southern side of the flood way lies immediately south of the site. Travel 3.94 miles (6.34 km) south on
and South Jackson Road from its intersection with US Highway 83, and then tum left (east) onto the levee road that
traverses the crest of the levee that forms the south side of the Hackney Lake Inlet flood way. A large canal borders
the south side of this levee. After 0.34 miles (0.55 kilometers) tum left onto a dirt road that descends from the levee
crest into the flood way, and about 60 m north of the levee crest to the east (right) of the dirt road lies an irrigated
bermuda grass pasture. Enter the pasture at this point and then travel about 250 m to the northeast to the center of
the site, in the process of which you will have to cross 4 double irrigation ditches which separate each hay field.

Description of Location

Datum N AD 1983

The site lies immediately adjacent to an abandoned Rio Grande channel that was the first major channel south of
Sardinas Resaca. Today the site is situated at the nexus of two agricultural fields and fallow land that abuts the
abandoned channel that now serves as a drain. The east-west dirt road that bisects the site is essentially Juan Balli
Road but in this area is not connected owing to the fact that it would cross the paleochannel twice. A low scarp
parallels the east-west dirt road (Juan Balli Road) with the north side being slightly (0.5 m) higher than the south
side, which is most likely an artifact of the leveling of the agricultural fields for irrigation. From the intersection of
US highway 83 and I Road (Veterans Boulevard), travel south on South I Road (aka South Veterans Boulevard)
about 4.8 miles (7.78 km) until reaching Juan Balli Road. On the right is an irrigation canal that is oriented
perpendicular to I Road. Unimproved dirt roads parallel both sides of this canal. Tum right off South I Road onto
the dirt road that parallels the left (south) side of the irrigation canal and follow it 0.41 miles (670 m) to the eastern
edge of the site. The site begins just before the agricultural field north of the dirt road ends.

Basis for Component
A Rabdotus snail collected from feature 1 in Trench 41.0 at a depth of 130 cm yielded an age of 4730±40 years
BP (Beta-370424). Temporal periods for other occupation levels is based on correlation with other dated
materials obtained during this survey.

Cultural Features
Feature 1 was a large (1.5 x 1.4 m) concentration of Rabdotus snail shells and burnt clay balls exposed on the floor
of trench 41.0 at 130 cmbs. A Rabdotus snail collected from this feature yielded an age of 4730±40 years BP (Beta­
370424)
•Feature 2 was a shallow (20 cm) deep pit exposed on the east wall of trench 41.1 between 105 and 125 cmbs and
contained charcoal and fragments of burnt earth.

•A scatter of burnt earth, and snails were observed between 80 and 90 cmbs within trench 4 1. 1.
• Feature 3 was a small (18 x 15 cm) circular patch of darker colored earth containing charcoal that was exposed
on the floor of trench 41.3 at a depth of 35 cmbs. This feature looks like a possible post.
• Feature 4 is a complex suite of two large charcoal fragments ( 10-12 cm wide) on either side of an in situ area of
burnt earth exposed on the floor of trench 41.3 between 80 and 85 cmbs. The burnt earth was clearly patterned and
may be structural remains, but it was difficult to make out what this feature represents.
•Feature 5 was a concentration of Rabdotus shells and small fragments of burnt earth exposed in the south wall of
trench 41.3 at a depth of 110-115 cmbs.
• A possible occupation was noted at a depth of 45 cmbs in trench 41.4 and consisted of a light scatter of burnt
earth, charcoal and snail shells.

Burnt clay balls. The majority of the occupations were delineated on the basis of either scatters of small fragments
of burnt earth, charcoal and snails, or on the basis of features such as pits containing burnt earth fragments and
charcoal, or dense concentrations of Rabdotus snails which were observed together with burnt clay balls and
charcoal.

Discussion of Site
The site appears to consist of several stratigraphically isolated, buried occupation surfaces. One of these contained
burned earth and large fragments of burnt wood (Feature 4) that looked like it could be remains of a burned
structure.

patterning of the rocks in the feature (i.e., dispersed, clumped, carefully arranged, etc.)?

FINE MATRIX: Describe the soil matrix within and immediately encompassing the feature. (1) Evidence of
Burning-does the feature contain charcoal, burned (or oxidized) soil, or ash? If so, describe exactly where these
occur (e.g., throughout, atop, among, below, and/or around the feature rocks). (2) Distinction-is the feature's
fine matrix distinguishable from that of the surrounding soil? If so, describe precisely how and where
differences (e.g., staining, color, texture, etc.) can be seen. (3) Soil Sampling-were soil samples taken? If so,
specify sample volumes and the exact provenience(s) where the samples were collected?

NONMATRIX CONSTITUENTS: Describe the perishable and nonperishable materials found directly within the
feature matrix or found outside the feature in apparent contextual association with the feature. For each
category, describe how association was determined. (1) Faunal-bone and shell remains (including counts, sizes,

intact, etc.? (5) Rock Density-were the rocks adjoining (less than 50% of the rocks are touching), adjacent (more
than 50% of the rocks are touching), overlapping (rocks touch and ovQrliip), or rnme combination of these? (6)
Rock Layering-describe and enumerate the layers of rocks present. (7) Feature Coherence-what was the general
patterning of the rocks in the feature (i.e., dispersed, clumped, carefully arranged, etc.)?

FINE MATRIX: Describe the soil matrix within and immediately encompassing the feature. (1) Evidence of
Burning-does the feature contain charcoa l, burned (or oxidized) soil, or ash? If so, describe exactly where these
occur (e.g., throughout, atop, among, below, and/or around the feature rocks). (2) Distinction-is the feature's
fine matrix distinguishable from that of the surrounding soil? If so, describe precisely how and where
differences (e.g., staining, color, texture, etc.) can be seen. (3) Soil Sampling-were soil samples taken? If so,
specify sample volumes and the exact provenience(s) where the samples were collected?

NONMATRIX CONSTITUENTS: Describe the perishable and nonperishable materials fou nd directly within the
feature matrix or found outside the feature in apparent contextual association w ith the feature. For each
category, describe how association was determined. (1) Faunal-bone and shell remains (including counts, sizes,

DIMENSIONS and MORPHOLOGY: Describe the feature's physical attributes including: (1) Size-Le., length,
width, thickness, and diameter at the top, base, center, and periphery, as relevant, of the feature. (2)
Volumetrics--Le., specify the approximate volumes of the screened and sampled fractions of the excavated
matrix. (3) Origination Surface-is the original surface upon which (or through which) the feature was
constructed apparent? If so, explain why and describe its location with respect to feature. (4) Outline Shape­
Le., oval, circular, irregular, etc. (5) Cross-section Shape-Le., lens-shaped, flat layer, shallow basin with concave
surface, deep pit with flat surface, mounded/stacked, etc. (6) Basal Configuration-Le., the shape of lower layer
of feature which may be different from overall cross-section shape. Did the feature rest within/upon a flat
surface, a shallow basin, or a deep pit? Does the entire feature rest on an inclining slope?

COARSE MATRIX: Describe and, if possible, quantify the feature's constituent rocks. (1) Rock Shape-Le., flat
slabs, rounded or angular cobbles, etc. (2) Rock Size-i.e., <3 cm, 3-1ocm, >10 cm, etc. Were rocks of a particular
size clustered within feature (e.g., small rocks mainly occur around the feature's perimeter)? (3) Rock
Counts/Weights-use a consistent accounting system and specify whether the quantities represent all rocks or
only the rocks larger than a certain size. (4) Rock Condition-was the rock fractured in situ, highly fragmented,
intact, etc.? (5) Rock Density-were the rocks adjoining (less than 50% of the rocks are touching), adjacent (more
than 50% of the rocks are touching), overlapping (rocks touch and overlap), or some combination of these? (6)
Rock Layering-describe and enumerate the layers of rocks present. (7) Feature Coherence-what was the general
patterning of the rocks in the feature (i.e., dispersed, clumped, carefully arranged, etc.)?

FINE MATRIX: Describe the soil matrix within and immediately encompassing the feature. (1) Evidence of
Burning-does the feature contain charcoal, burned (or oxidized) soil, or ash? If so, describe exactly where these
occur (e.g., throughout, atop, among, below, and/or around the feature rocks). (2) Distinction-is the feature's
fine matrix distinguishable from that of the surrounding soil? If so, describe precisely how and where
differences (e.g., staining, color, texture, etc.) can be seen. (3) Soil Sampling-were soil samples taken? If so,
specify sample volumes and the exact provenience(s) where the samples were collected?

NONMATRIX CONSTITUENTS: Describe the perishable and nonperishable materials found directly within the
feature matrix or found outside the feature in apparent contextual association with the feature. For each
category, describe how association was determined. (1) Faunal-bone and shell remains (including counts, sizes,
identifications, burned vs. unburned, etc.). (2) Floral-counts, identifications, etc. (3) Cultural Materials-lithics,
ceramics, etc.

DEFINITION: While the identifying characteristics of a given feature may be readily apparent to the field
archeologist, these should be spelled out clearly in the site records. Provide an overview explaining why the
feature was called a feature and what its defining elements are.

STRATIGRAPHIC CONTEXT: Carefully describe and interpret the feature's physical relationships with all relevant
stratigraphic elements (i.e., encompassing, overlying, underlying, and adjacent layers, features, and/or
interfaces).

CULTURAL CONTEXT: Provisionally assess the apparent cultural affiliation (time period, component, etc.).

DAILY JOURNAL
Project# 100020726
Project Name: SH365 additional Historic Resources Survey
Date: Wednesday 30 April 2014
Client: HCRMA
Type of Work: Cultural Resources Survey
Author: Angela Stuewe Moody
Site(s): None
Project Week: 1
Brandy Harris and I checked out of the Comfort Suites hotel about 7:30 am and proceeded to the project
area where Andrea Burden had asked us to do a short archaeological survey of a small corn field. When
we arrived there were knee-tall corn plants in an irrigated field, which lead to caked mud over our boots
and basically high kicks to avoid disturbing the plants as we stepped from one row to another, surveying
the approximately 200mby100 m triangular parcel at 30 m intervals (see photo). We found no
significant cultural materials, only an occasional Rabdotus snail shell and modern trash including a piece
of asphalt, a flip flop, and a mustard packet. There were no rocks on the southeastern edge of the field,
but small limestone rocks appeared in the matrix as we approached the tip on the triangle on the
northwest side of the field. After attempting to get most of the mud off before we got back into the rental,
we proceeded to survey a couple more areas for historic resources. We then made our way back to
Harlingen to drop off the rental and board a plane bound for Houston to Austin at 1:30 pm. In Houston
our plane was delayed about 30 minutes, but the pilot flying the Austin leg made up the time. We left
ABIA about 4:30 pm.

Time Period of Occupation:
Unknown prehistoric
Basis for Time: Lack of diagnostics recovered
Single Component: False

Multiple Component: False

Component Unknown: True

Basis for Component: Lack of diagnostics recovered
Cultural Features:
None observed
Approximate Site Size: 20 meters N-S by 85 meters E-W
Basis for Determination: Extent of materials recovered sub-surface
Top of Deposit Below Surface: 10-20cmbs
Basis for Determination: Shovel tests; artifacts recovered beginning at Level 2 (10-20cmbs)
Thickness of Deposit: 20cm
Basis for Determination: Shovel tests; artifacts recovered in Levels 2 through 3 (10-30cmbs)
Artifactual Materials Present:
The site was initially located through systematic shovel testing. A total of 13 shovel tests were excavated arcoss the
site to determine the horizontal and vertical extent, 4 of which were positive for cultural materials yielding the following
artifacts in Levels 2 through 3 (10-30cmbs): 3 pieces of lithic debitage and 1 fire cracked rock.
Discussion of Site:
Temporary site MB43 represents at least one prehistoric occupation period of unknown origin. The presence of lithic
debitage suggests that lithic tools were produced, utilized, and/or maintained at the site. The paucity of a materials
recovered or any intact cultural features suggests the site has been degraded or represents a more ephemeral
prehistoric activity such as retooling.

Description of Location:
The site is located on the edge of a rise in the middle of a fallow field. From 14 Mile Road and FM681 travel north on
FM681 approximately 1.6km. The site is located on the left side of the road in a fallow field approximately 450 meters

~N_Vi~6._N_M_[il1
Nearest Natural Water: Unnamed tributary to the Rio Grande at 1.5 km west
Major Creek Drainage: Rio Grande River
Name of Drainage Basin: Rio Grande River
SCS Soil Series, Mapping Unit:
Brennan fine sandy loam, 1-3% slopes
Soil Genetic Type: Alfisols
Percentage Ground Surface Visible: 30
Surface Texture: Sandy Loam
Soil Derivation: In Situ: False
Marine: False
Other Soils:

Eolian: True

Colluvial: False

Alluvial: False

Environmental/Topographical Setting:
The site is located on a sides/ope of a broad ridge in an overgrown fallow field.

Time Period of Occupation:
Unknown prehistoric
Basis for Time: Lack of diagnostics recovered
Single Component: False

Multiple Component: False
Basis for Component: Lack of diagnostics recovered

Component Unknown: True

Cultural Features:
None observed
Approximate Site Size: 90 meters E-W by 30 meters N-S
Basis for Determination: Extent of surface and sub-surface cultural materials
Top of Deposit Below Surface: 40-50cmbs
Basis for Determination: Shovel tests; artifacts recovered beginning at Level 5 (40-50cmbs)
Thickness of Deposit: 10cm
Basis for Determination: Shovel tests; artifacts recovered from Level 5 (40-50cmbs) only
Artifactua/ Materials Present:
The site was initially located based upon its surface expression, which includes a light scatter of lithic matreials. The
site area was then subject to an intensive surface inspection, which revealed the following materials: 1 untyped
projectile point fragment and 1 piece of lithic debitage. A total of 11 shovel tests were then excavated across the site
area to determine the horizontal and vertical extent, 1 of which was culturally positive yielding 1 piece of lithic
debitage in Level 5 (40-50cmbs).
Discussion of Site:
Temporary site MB56 represents at least one prehistoric occupation period of unknown origin. he presence of lithic
debitage suggests that lithic tools were produced, utilized, and/or maintained at the site. The paucity of a materials
recovered or any intact cultural features suggests the site has been degraded or represents a more ephemeral
prehistoric activity such as retooling.

Time Period of Occupation:
Unknown prehistoric
Basis for Time: Lack of diagnostics recovered
Single Component: False
Multiple Component: False
Basis for Component: Lack of diagnostics recovered

Component Unknown: True

Cultural Features:
1 possible burned rock feature
Approximate Site Size: 30 meters N-S by 10 meters E-W
Basis for Determination: Extent of cultural materials located sub-surface
Top of Deposit Below Surface: 40-50cmbs
Basis for Determination: Shovel tests; artifacts recovered beginning at Level 5 (40-50cmbs)
Thickness of Deposit: 15
Basis for Determination: Shovel tests; artifacts recovered in Levels 5 through 6 (40-55cmbs}
Artifactual Materials Present:
The site was initially located through systematic shovel testing. A total of 12 shovel tests were excavated across the
site to determine the horizontal and vertical extent, 2 of which were culturally positive yielding the following artifacts in
Levels 5 thorugh 6 (40-55cmbs): 1 fauna!, 1 charcoal sample, 2 primary flakes, 1 utilized secondary flake, and 2
tertiary flakes.
Discussion of Site:
Temporary site PSSL 1 represents at least one prehistoric occupation of unknown origin. The presence of lithic tools
and debitage suggests that lithic tools were produced, utilized, and/or maintained at the site. It is believed that the
charcoal may represent a burned rock feature located within the shovel test. The paucity of a larger artifact
assemblage and any intact cultural features suggests the site has suffered from some erosional degradation.

Time Period of Occupation:
Unknown prehistoric
Basis for Time: Lack of diagnostics recovered
Single Component: False

Multiple Component: False

Component Unknown: True

Basis for Component: Lack of diagnostics recovered
Cultural Features:
None observed
Approximate Site Size: 35 meters N-S by 20 meters E-W
Basis for Determination: Extent of materials recovered sub-surface
Top of Deposit Below Surface: 0-1 Ocmbs
Basis for Determination: Shovel tests; artifacts recovered beginning at Level 1 (0-1 Ocmbs)
Thickness of Deposit: 10cm
Basis for Determination: Shovel tests; artifacts recovered in Level 1 (0-1 Ocmbs} only
Artifactua/ Materials Present:
The site was initially located through systematic shovel testing. A total of 10 shovel tests were excavated across the
site to determine the horizontal and vertical extent, 2 of which were positive for cultural materials yielding the following
artifacts in Level 1 (0-10cmbs): 2 secondary flakes and 2 tertiary flakes.
Discussion of Site:
Temporary site PSSL2 represents at least prehistoric occuapation period of unknown origin. The presence of lithic
debitage suggests that /ithic tools were produced, utilized, and/or maintained at the site. The paucity of a materials
recovered or any intact cultural features suggests the site has been degraded or represents a more ephemera/
prehistoric activity such as retooling.

Circumstances Affecting Observations:
Fair weather, moderate ground surface visibility

RE: Notification of Unknown Cemetery
Dear Ms Leal:
Regarding the possible grave that I sent the Hidalgo County Clerk's Office a notification
form for on August 13, 2014, I have received new information indicating that the location
is not actually a grave.
Ms. Rosalinda Zamora, the landowner of parcel 504492, called me on August 18, 2014 in
respond to my letter about the possible grave on that parcel. She stated that in 1972, her
brother Roberto Zamora was killed in a hunting accident at that location and the possible
grave feature was actually a memorial for him.
She stated that if we needed any further information, we should call Roberto's son,
Lorenzo Zamora at (956) 432-7690.
I confirmed that Roberto Zamora died in an accidental gun discharge on June 7, 1972.
The address given on the death certificate (attached) is No. 33 4 Mile Line Road NW,
which is the closest address to the possible grave site. The death certificate also indicates
that Mr. Zamora is buried at another location, Penitas Cemetery.

If you have any questions concerning this matter, please do not hesitate to
contact me at (512) 342-3337.

THE STATE OF TEXAS

KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS:

§

COUNTY OF HIDALGO

THAT the undersigned, acting pursuant to the provisions of Section 711.011 of the Texas
Health and Safety Code, set forth this notice of the discovery of an unknown or abandoned cemetery.
The legal description for the land occupied by the Cemetery is (provide survey and abstract numbers
and a description; attach as an Exhibit to Notice if necessary):
Property ID: 504492
PORCION 77 LOT 9-A BEING THE W30.09AC-S81.89AC-120.82 TRACT OF LAND 30.09AC NET
See attached map.

The Cemetery is evidenced by [describe archeological evidence resulting from exposure by
erosion, inadvertent excavations, intentional excavations, or other evidence-for example, features
such as markers with inscriptions, graves marked only by stone, archeological evidence resulting from
inadvertent excavations, fencing, commonly used grave plantings (iris, crape myrtle)]:
During the pedestrian survey on February 2, 2009, Atkins archeologists identified a fenced area
approximately 10 x 10 ft square surrounding a small wooden cross placed perpendicularly into the
ground near the northwest corner of parcel R504492. The fence consisted of four 6-ft-tall wooden posts.
The wooden cross lacks any personal identification (e.g., name or dates), but a few small glass cups
similar to widely available glass vases containing votive candles were observed near the cross (see
attached photographs). Based on this evidence, this appears to be cemetery consisting of at least one
marked human grave.
