Stop 1: Blasdel Point Bar-Brazos River
The meandering stream environment may be subdivided into a meander
belt and flanking flood basins. The purpose of this stop is to observe
a point bar, the major depositional feature of the meander belt. A
meandering stream deposits point bars on the convex banks of the bends
while the concave cut banks are eroded. The combination of these
processes results in episodic (flood) lateral accretion which produces
a ridge and swale topograghy on the older parts of the bar. The depositional surface slopes upward from the channel bottom and is covered
with a series of bedforms ranging, deep to shallow water, from dunes
to plane beds and ripples. Cross beds, horizontal laminae, and cress
laminae, respectively, mark the downstream migration of these forms.
The lateral migration of the bar produces a characteristic vertical
sequence of these primary structures which was described for the Brazos
by Bernard et al. (1970) afterdetailed study of this point bar. The
base of the sequence, corresponding to the deepest part of the channel,
is marked by an erosional surface covered with poorly bedded coarse
sand and gravel. This is succeeded by cross bedded fine to coarse sand

2

horizontally laminated very fine to med'ium sand, and cross-l aminated
silt to very fine sand. The thickness of the deposit is determined by
river depth at floodstage. The thickness averages .16.75 m (55 ft.).
Floods also result in aggradation because natural levees are deposited
on the banks and abandoned channels and oxbow~ are filled with silt and
mud. Natural levees are composed of mud and minor amounts of silt and
therefore, except for a lack of structures, are hard to distinquish
uppermost point bar deposits (Bernard, et al., 1970).

Stop 2= The Colorado River Delta
Until 1929 9 a large log jam in the Colorado river severely restricted the transport of sediment to Matagorda Bay. A 91m (3000 ft.)
mud bar was the only river deposit in the bay. Once the logs were
removed~ the previously trapped sediment was deposited as a narrow
lobate delta. In 1935, the I\rmy Corps of Enqineers deepened and
stabilized the chann&l across the bay and throuqh Mataqorda Peninsula
and delta progradation within the bay was halted since sediments
were delivered directly to the Gulf. The present elonqate form of the
delta is a result of deposition from floodwaters spil1inq over the
artificial levees.
The deltaic environment may be divided into the delta plain,
delta front, and prodelta facies. The delta plain is the only active
facies today since bay sediments are now covering all other areas of
the Colorado delta. The delta plain is marked by hiqh and low marsh
deposits, beach ridges, and distributary channel fills. The low marsh
deposits consist of grey·-fine-grained material presumably derived from
the bay. The sltght~ coarser.grained, reddish-brown high marsh
deposits are probably flood deposited river sediments. Ooth high and
low marshes have washout pans, low areas where trapped brackish water
prevents rooted-plant growth, with well developed algal crusts. Waves
form transgressive beach ridges of cross·bedded coquina on the margins
of the plain. Distributary channel fills consist-,\)f sand with clay
clasts overlain by burrowed or laminated silty clay and sand. Burrowed
sand bars are also common in these channels. The delta front facies
consists of tan, trough cross-bedd~ sand and silty sand deposited as
distributary mouth bars and unburrowed, reddish-brown, silty clay and
sandy silt in the interdist1butary areas. The prodelta deposits
typically are reddish-brown, laminated clays which are unburrowed in
spite of a diverse fauna. Rapid deposition is thought to preserve
the oxidized color and exclude the burrowing organisms (Kanes, W.H.,1970).
Continue on Fm 2031 to stop 3 Matagorda beach
Stop 3: Matagorda Peninsula Barrier
Beach
,
Approximately 5,000 to 3,000 years ago sea level reached its present
positton. As a result of this still-stand a regressive set of sediments
has formed along most of the Texas coast. A significant part of these
sediments Ilong nearly all of the Texas coast have been deposited by
the progrlda.tion of barrier islands. Matagorda (barrier) Island is a
long linear sand body that seperates Matagorda Bay from the Gulf of
Mexico. Matagorda Island can be divided into three modern depositional
environments: 1) blck bay or lagoon; 2) Subtidal to subaerial barrier
beach complex; and 3) Subtidas-intert1dal in1 channels and tidal del
At this stop the subtidal to subaer1 barrier beach complex can

Stop 1: San luis Pass
, San Luis Pass separates the western end of Galveston Island from Matagorda Island. The pass is a tidal channel or inlet, with flood and ebb
tidal deltas located on the gulf and bay sides, respectively. The currents
that flow through the pass have a velocity tMat ranqes from .5m/ sec . to
1.6m/sec during flood tide and averages 2.1 Isec during ebb tide. The
currents·transport a tremendous amount of sediment.
The dominant sediment in both the tidal channels and deltas is sand
with some mud. The flood (bay) tidal delta is characterized by planar
cross beds, trough cross beds, and subaqueous giant ripples. Features
of the ebb tidal delta (gulf) are controlled by both tidal currents and
wave interaction. This produces a complex, bedform distribution of ebb
oriented sand waves and modified subaqueous barchan dunes both having
multidirectional cross beds. .

Stop 2:

High Island Salt Dome

The town of High Island is topographically above the surrounding
marsh because the Pleistocene Beaumont Formation has been domed by a salt
intrusion. According to Halbouty (1967), the top of the salt column lies
at a depth of 375m (1230 ft.) while the top caprock is only 46m (150 ft.)
below the surface. These shallow depths probably account for the betterthan-average topographic expression of the High Island Dome.
During emplacement the intrusion warps, pierces, and displaces
(along faults) the overlying and surrounding strata. Individual layers
are abruptly terminated by and dip steeply away from the vertical flanks
of the intrusion. These structures often form petroleum reservoirs and
since the layers have been tilted and uplifted, hydrocarbons would tend
to migrate there. This effect is exhibited on the northwest flank of the
High Island dome where the 5-7m (15-20 ft.) thick basal Miocene sand
contains art 011 column at least 760m (2500 ft.) thick. The salt was
discovered in 1901 and was thought to be barren of petroleum until 1922
when the structure of the caprock-salt overhang was fi:'st understood. Oil
was found after drill ing through 395m (1300 ft.) of ~aprock and salt. Hi qh
Island, along with the major producing fields of south Louisiana, is
part of the onshore Miocene trend while most Texas coast domes are in the
Vega or Frio (Eocene, 01igocen~)trend. From 1960 to 1962, 27,751 long
tons of sulphur were mined from the caprock using a steam injection
(Frasch) process (Halbouty, M.T., 1967, Salt domes Gulf region, United
States and Mexico: Houston, Gulf Publishing Co., 425p.)

Stop 3:

McFaddin Beach

This segment of beach ;s very narrow and steep compared to the one
observed on Matagorda peninsula. Here the shoreline has been moving
landward in response to wave erosion. About 1 m. of sand has been deposited
on fine-grained marsh deposits forming a minor trans9ress;ve sequence,
Highway 87 has been moved landward at least 4 times in the last 50 years
and the beach ridges must be rebuilt by heavy equipment after each storm.
Rai.lroad spikes from a narrow guage railroad that once ran from Sabine
Pass to Galveston at a position roughly 1/4 mile offshore have been
found as cores of concretions near here. Armoured mud balls and asphalt
reworked from submerged highways are evidence of the prevailing local
eros.ion which ;s probably due to the Sabine Pass jetties. By impounding
sedi.ment updrift (east) and starving the downdrift beaches, they alter the
balance between sediment supply and wave activity. Natural phenomena such
as tides, storms, and relative sea level changes in response to subsidence
also contribute to the local erosion.
Rates and direction of shoreline changes vary greatly along the
Texas coast. Areas such as Bolivar peninsula have prograded while, at
the same time, ~kFaddin beach has retreated. This;s illustrated by
their beach widths, 50 m. and 17-25 m., respectively. According to
Morton (1977), other eroding shorelines, include the southern half of
Padre Island, and the area between Galveston Island and the Colorado
River (except in the vicinity of the active Brazos delta).

A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE
QUATERNARY STRATIGRAPHY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY
OF THE
SOUTHEAST TEXAS - SOUTHWEST LOUISIANA COAST
Catherine A. Rigsby
ABSTRACT
The Quaternary coastal plain of Southeast Texas - Southwest
Louisiana consists of two to four major Pleistocene surfaces and a
modified Holocene surface. These surfaces represent different sea
level stands and are the tops of five formations which vary considerably in thickness laterally because of the topography of the
surfaces they bury. Maximum thicknesses are generally on the order
of 61 to 91 meters; the units thin drastically up dip and across
paleodivides. Although the Pleistocene formations form a continuous belt parallel to the coast in Texas and Louisiana, they have
different names in each state: (Texas names in parenthesis), the
Wi1liana (Willis) Formation, the Bentley (Lower Lissie) Formation,
the Montgomery (Upper Lissie) Formation, the Prairie (Beaumont)
Formation. The Holocene surface, which has been modified to form
a sixth group of sediments, includes the Deweyville Formation and
Modern alluvium. Each formation in this Pleistocene Houston Group
is a fining upward sequence and the group as a whole also becomes
finer upward.
Quaternary geomorphic features are either erosional (fluvial),
depositional (fluvial or marine marginal), or low intensity tectonic
(fault or fault and domal systems). Depositional features are most
abundant.
INTRODUCTION
This paper follows the traditional view of the geology of the
Gulf Coast west of the Mississippi delta as developed by H.N. Fisk
and subsequent workers who elaborated on his ideas. Fisk developed
his concept of the Quaternary geology in numerous articles during
the 1930 s and 1940 s. The geology of this area has not been worked
out in sufficient detail. Recent work suggests that there is much
more to be done.
l

1

Most surface exposures in the Gulf coast are sand and clay facies
deposited under continental or brackish water conditions. Each major
sedimentary unit thickens toward the Gulf. The sedimentary facies
of the continental shelf, which extends seaward to a depth of about
180 meters, consists of a recent, coarse textured facies that is made
up of sand, silty clay, and clay (Greenman and LeBlanc, 1965). This
paper will be primarily concerned with the coastal plain sediments
within tre area shown in figure 1.
The Cenozoic history of the Gulf Coast as described by Williamson
(1959) is the result of several transgressions and regressions caused
by glacial and interglacial periods. Pleistocene glaciation caused
sea level to fall 100 meters or more, with extensive vertical erosion
the result.

Pleistocene Series - Houston Group

The name Houston Group was proposed by Plummer (1933) for the
Pleistocene of the Texas Gulf coast. The group is limited on the
north by the Hockley scarp, on the south by the Holocene beach deposits,
on the east by the
ne River and on the west by the Rio Grande.
Each of the formations in the Houston Group has equivalent Louisiana
~ich VJas named after Houston,
formations (Meyer, 1939). The group,
orig nally included only the lissie and the
Harris County,
Beaumont formations. The Willis Formation was considered to be Late
Pliocene. More recently the Willis has been considered Plio-Pleistocene
or even preglacial Pleistocene (Aronow I 19b)~ therefore it will be
included in this study of the Houston Group.

Formation. The ~~illis formation was narried by
Doering 1935
town of Willis, Montgomery County, Texas. In
louisiana this formation is called the Williana. It was named by
Fisk (1938) after the Williana terraoe which got its name from the
town of Williana, Grant Parish, Louisiana (Fisk, 1940). It rests
unconformably on the Tertiary Fleming Formation. It is a red, coarse,
slightly indurated sand formation with gravel constituents and extends

The formation is fluviatile in orlgln and contains cross-bedded
channel and point bar deposits, consisting of coarse, gravelly sand,
and levee and flood basin deposits, containing fine silty and clayey
sediments (Aronow, 1979b). Small ferruginous concretions are abundant
in weathered zones. Bernard (1950) divides the formation into three
informal units: a basal coarse gravelly facies, a central sandy
facies, and an upper 511
clay facies. The central sandy facies
makes up about one-half of the formation, and the upper silty clay
facies is lacking or has been eroded away in southeast Texas.
The basal

sand and gravel with clay clasts, resulting in a cornmeal texture. is
common. The basal sands contirin a small percentage of reworked bentonite (Bernard. 1950).
Bentley (Lower Lissie) Formation. The Bentley (Lower Lissie)
Formation unconformably overlies the Willis (Williana) Formation and
unconformably underlies the Montgomery (Upper Lissie) Formation. The
Bentley Formation was named by Fisk in 1938. It got its name from
the underlying Bentley terrace which was named after the town of
Bentley, Grant Parish, Louisiana (Fisk, 1938). The unit is called the
Lower Lissie Formation in Texas. The Lissie Formation was named by
Deussen (1914) for the town of Lissie, Wharton County, Texas. The
Bentley outcrops in a belt parallel to the coast and occurs at elevations between 30m and 60m above sea level. The formation has a
seaward gradient between .6 and 1.5 meters per kilometer (Bernard and
LeBlanc, 1965). The total thickness of the Bentley is approximately
30 meters (Aronow, 1968) in southeast Texas but varies considerably
with the topography of the underlying surface in each locality.
The Bentley contains a coastwide deltaic facies and an island
fluviatile facies. The deltaic facies is made up of predominantly
finer materials, and the fluviatile facies is made up of predominantly
coarser materials (Bernard, 1950). Ther: are some marine deposits
which contain forams and shell fragments (Meyer, 1939).
Surface materials of the Bentley consist of fine sands, silts,
and silty clays. The formation fines upward, is usually cross-bedded,
and is dominantly brown. It;s hard to distinguish the Bentley from
the underlying Willis, and difference in elevation is considered the
best criterion (Bernard, 1950).
Mont orner U er Lissie Formation. The formation was named by
Fisk 1938 and got its name from the underlying Montgomery terrace.
The terrace was named after the town of Montgomery, Grant Parish,
Louisiana (Fisk, 1940). This formation is called the Upper Lissie
in Texas~ The Montgomery outcrops in a belt parallel to the coast
at elevations between 21m and 37.5m. It has a seaward gradient of

.45m to .95m per kilometer (Bernard and LeBlanc, 1965). The Montgomery (Upper Lissie) is approximately 30m thick and consists of
clay, silt, sand, and some siliceous gravel (I'ronow, 1968).
As with the Bentley, the Montgomery has a fluviatile and a
deltaic facies. Crossbedding is common in the fluviatile facies
which averages 10.5 meters thick. There is no gravel in the
deltaic facies.
This formation is finer grained and less oxidized than either
the Bentley (Lower Lissie) or the Willis (Williana). The Montgomery
coarsens landward and consists mainly of ferruginous sands and
clays. Limonite nodules are common as is mottling (Bernard, 1950).
Prairie (Beaumont) Formation. The Louisiana Prairie Formation
was named by Fisk in 1940. It gets its name from the underlying
Prairie terrace (Fisk, 1940). This formation is equivalent to
the Beaumont Formation which was named by Hayes and Kennedy (1903)
for Beaumont, Jefferson County, Texas. It occupies the flat,
treeless coastal plains about 16 to 24 kilometer from the coast
and is about 64 kilometers wide (Sellards, Adkins, and Plummer,
1933). This formation occurs at elevations from 21 to 30 meters to
just a few meters or centimeters above sea level at its contact with
the Recent. The seaward gradient of the Beaumont (Prairie) is
between .2 and .45 meters per kilometers (Bernard and LeBlanc, 1965).
The Beaumont (Prairie) Formation lies unconformably on the
Montgomery (Upper Lissie) Formation and is unconformably overlain
by the Recent Deweyville Formation (Sellards, Adkins, and Plummer,
1933). It consists of clays, calcareous clays, sandy clays,
clayey sands, and fine sands (Doering, 1935). Thickness figures
for the Beaumont Formation vary from + 40 meters (Aronow, 1968)
to 120 - 270 meters (Sellards, Adkins~ and Plummer, 1933).
.
Its thickness,like the thicknesses of the other Quaternary
coastal formations, varies with the topography of the underlying
erosional surface.
This formation is mostly alluvial and deltaic with some
marine and lagoonal deposits (Sellards, Adkins, and Plummer, 1933).
Depositional environments found within the formation include
strand plains, flood basins, and meander ridges (Aronow, 1979a).
The clay content of the Beaumont is greater than that of the
Montgomery (Upper Lissie) indicating the continuing upward fining
within the group (Meyer, 1939). According to Sellards, Adkins, and
Plummer (1933), the formation is 60 to 90 percent clay, up to 20
percent silt, and up to 20 percent sand. Montmorillinite is the
major clay mineral. It varies in color from blue-gray to yellowgray, to purple and some shades of red. It also contains some
calcareous concretions and decomposed wood. The sand is a chert
sublitharenite with small shell fragments and small amounts of
pyrite and mica flakes. It is light to bluish gray and varies from
medium to fine grained.

Soils on the surface of the Beaumont (Prairie) Formation are
usually dark, heavy, and clayey. The surface features of the formation include pimple mounds and pock marks but it is generally flat
and featureless. There are some, but not many marine and brackish
water shell deposits. (Sel1ards~ Adkins, and Plummer, 1933).
Holocene Series
Holocene sediments of southwest Texas and southwest Louisiana
are dominantly alluvial deposits. Estuarine and beach deposits are
now being formed (Meyer, 1939). Other depositional environments
include coastal marshes and beach and barrier islands (Aronow, 1979a).
Marine sands, sandy shales, and shales are being deposited contemperaneously in the Gulf of Mexico, and Recent deposits are almost
absent a few miles inland (Meyer, 1939),
Deweyville Formation. The Deweyville Formation was named by
Bernard (1950) after the town of Deweyville, Newton County, Texas.
It consists of sand with some gravel. Surface features include
meander remnants, oxbows, channel segments, and point bar deposits
(Aronow, 1979b). The Deweyville has a seaward gradient of approximately 0.0037 to 0.22 meters per kilometer (Bernard and LeBlanc,
1965) .
Modern alluvium. Modern alluvium (Late Holocene) deposits
commonly include man-made materials such as spoil and fill. Other
contemporaneous deposits include barrier island and estuarine deposits
(Aron9 w, 1968). The alluvium, approximately 9 meters thick (Bernard,
1950), was deposited during the last rise in sea level. It becomes
finer upward, and contains much driftwood. Today this unit has a
seaward gradient varying from 0.0018 to 0.26 meters per kilometer
(Bernard and LeBlanc, 1965).
GEOMORPHOLOGY
Geomorphic features along the Gulf coast fall into three major
categories: those resulting from depositlonal processes (fluvial
or marine marginal), those resulting from erosional processes (fluvial),
and those resulting from low intensity tectonics (fault or fault and
domal systems). Depositional features are by far the most common in
the area. Figure 5 shows the distribution of these features in
southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana.
Depositional Features
Depositional features are abundant along the coast and thus significant in classification of coastal sedimentary environments. The
Beaumont-Port Arthur and Galveston-Houston sheets of the Environmental
Geologic Atlas of Texas (1973) illustrate the-depositional features
present in the area. Principal depositonal features are described below and for the sake of simplicity are listed alphabetically.

Abandoned river channels and oxbows. Abandoned channels
and oxbOws are formed when a stream forms a cutoff across a
narrow meander neck (fig.6). They appear as low swales or oxbow
lakes and mayor may not be filled. The nature of the sediment
fill is determined by the speed of channel abandonment. If the
channel is abandoned slowly, the sediment consists of clay and
silt coarsening downward to thin layers of silt and sand, then
to sand and rarely, ~ravel. When the abandonment is fast, the
resultant sediment is finer and the end result is a "clay plug",
Abandoned channels and oxbows are found within both the alluvial
and the deltaic plains.
Alluvial or fluvial plains. The alluvial plains of the
coastal area, produced by extensive deposition of alluvium, are
gently sloping tracts confined to the stream valleys. They
merge seaward with the deltaic plains (Bernard and LeBlanc,
19(5) .

Barrier islands.

Gulf coast barriers restrict the entrance
Most Gulf Coast
barrier islands can be classified as microtidal. They are
characterized by abundand washover fans, infrequent tidal inlets,
and large flood-tidal delt~5(Hayes and Kana, 1976}. According to
Shepard (1960), the barriers may be several kilometers wide and 6
to 18 meters (20 to 60 feet) thick.

to bays or separate lagoons from the Gulf.

•

Barrier islands can be divided into three main facies: the
barrier beach facies, the lagoonal or back barrier facies, and
the tidal channel-delta facies. The barrier beach and channeldelta facies consist mainly of sand, whereas the back barrier
facies can consist of both sand and mud (Reinson, 1979) .
The barrier beach facies of Gulf Coast barrier islands
consists of clean ,well-sl!>rted quartz sand wi th small amounts
of feldspar. The sand is fine to very fine and shells and shell
fragments are abundant. The dune sands are similar to the beach
sands, but the silt content is somewhat higher and shells are
not as conmon. Dunes are extremely rare in southeast. Texas and
southwest Louisiana.
Galveston Island is a regressive barrier island (fig.?).
It exhibits coarsening upward trends and an upward shift from
biogenic to physical structures can be observed (Hayes and Kana,
1976) .
The Boliver-Galveston barrier is the eastmost end of a
chai.n of barrier islands that continues about 966 kilometers.
Chains of this type are common in coastal interdeltaic environments. Pleistocene chains, such as the Smith Point-OrangeHouston Bayou chain formed during the last high-sea-level stand.

limit of storm waves or regular tides. They may occur as a series
of parallel deposits. These ridges represent positions of past
shorelines. The Texas-Louisiana beach ridges have a maximum height
of about 3.7 meters (12 feet). They consist of fine, well-sorted
sand with abundant shell fragments (Bernard, LeBlanc, and Major,
1962) .
The beach ridges on both the Texas and Louisana sides of
Sabine Pass are in an arcuate, fan-like arrangement. This
suggests a gradual closing of the mouth of Sabine Lake, which
must have originally been an open estuary to the Gulf (Aronow,
1971) .

Chenier plain. The southwest Louisana chenier plain ;s an
extensive plain consisting of abundant beach ridges (cheniers),
marshes, lakes, and coastal mudflats. The beach ridges, which
are usually covered by oak trees, are 14 to 32 kilometers (15 to
20 miles) long, 153 to 305 meters (500 to 1000 feet) wide, and
1.5 to 4.5 meters (5 to 15 feet) thick.
Figure 8 is a generalized cross section of the southwest
Louisana chenier plain. The initial phase of the sedimentary
sequence is a slow trangression (phase II, fig. B). The upper
units were deposited in both transgressive and regressive phases
{III}. Depositional regression occured during periods of
moder~te rate of supply.
This regression was due to the seaward
prograding of tidal flats (IlIA). Beach ridges (cheniers) were
produced during periods of reduced supply (IIIB) {Hayes and Kana,
1976} •
The cheniers themselves consist of sand or shell-debris
ridges. They are unable to form during periods of high sediment
supply because the currents cannot sort the sediments and mudflats
result. But, if the supply decreases the longshore currents and
waves erode and winnow the mudflat sediments into cheniers.
Therefore, the shoreline progrades in a step-wise fashion (Elliott,
1978) .
Coastal interdeltaic plain. The coastal interdeltaic plain
is a narrow depositional surface which parallels the coast and is
situated between the deltas of the largest streams. Chenier and
barrier plains are included in the interdeltaic plain (Bernard and
LeBlanc, 1965). The actual sedimentary sequence deposited in these
areas depends upon sediment availability and rate of rise or fall
of sea-level (Selley, 197~). Figure 9 shows the different types
of sedimentary sequences that may be deposited .
.
Deltas. Deltas and deltaic sediments, produced by deposition
of sediment into the relatively still Gulf of Mexico or into one
of the bays, from a large part of the coastal plain. Several types
of deltas are present along the Gulf Coast including cuspate deltas

constructed bt the Colorado river, at the mouth of the channel cut
across the Bolivar Pennisula, and another produced by the Brazos river,
an elongate-lobate delta deposited by the Colorado river in Matagorda
Bay; birdfoot-lobate deltas constructed by the San Jacjnto and Trinity
Rivers also in Galveston Bay; a modified arcuate-cuspate delta constructed
by the Mississippi. In general Gulf Coast deltamorphologies illustrate
a very strong interaction between wave energy and rate of sediment supply.
Deltaic plain. The deltaic plain of the Texas-Louisana coast
includes distributary and tidal channels~ natural levees, and flood
basins. The upper deltaic plain contains fine grained sediments and fresh
water fauna and flora (Bernard and LeBlanc, 1965).
Flood basins or backswamps. Flood basins and backswamps occur
adjacent to and between stream meander belts. These areas are subject
to flooding during overbank stages. The sediments, consisting of
clay and silt, are much finer than those found in the nearby meander
belts. Calcerous and ferruginous nodules and abundant organic materials are present in the flood basin sediments. Pleistocene soils in
these areas are usually dark, but the Recent soils may vary with the color
of the source material.
Natural levees. A natural levee ~s a long low ridge built by a
streamon the flood plain along both sides of the channel (Fig. 6). It
is the building of natural levees thutgradually raises the entire meander
belt of the river above the level of the adjacent flood plain. The
natural levees in southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana vary in
size with the size of the stream. The levees of the Brazos and Colorado rivers are .3 to 1.5 meters high and 4.5 meters to 1.6 kilometers wide. They consist of light colored sandy or silty soil and
have a steep slope from the river (Bernard, Le.Blanc, and Major, 1962).
Coastal marshes. The coastal marshes of southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana are flat, featureless, poorly drained areas. They contain
rounded lakes and meandering tidal channels and are inudated during
extremely high tides. The soils in the ~Jrshes nre dark, and the sediments are fine-grained silts and clays. Marsh vegetation varies from
fresh to brakish to salt marsh types of flora. Salt grass is the primary vegetation in the Pleistocene marshes, and reed and other types
of grasses are more common in the Recent marshes.
Meander belts. The meander belts of the area are slightly higher
and have a greater relief than the ajoining flood basins. Recent meander
belts contain abandoned channels, natural levees, and point bar ridges
and swales (Fig. 6). Pleistocene meander belts, which contain many
pock marks and pimple mounds, are not as abundant as Recent ones.
Meander belt sediments, with the exception of the abandoned channels,
are silty and sandy. The Pleistocene sediments are usually light
grey, but-as in the flood basins, Radant sediments are variable in
color (Bernard and LeBlanc, 1965).

24

Coastal mudflats. Coastal mudflats are relatively level
accumulations of silt and clay along the shore. This silt and clay
is deposited in the Gulf by rivers and by coast erosion, where the
amount of sand and clay is in excess of the wave and current capacity,
a widespread offlappinq mudflat sequence results, When the sediment
supply is reduced, the waves and currents erode and straighten the
shoreline and an onlapping sequence of beach deposits begins to form.
The mudflats are only a few feet above sea level and are flooded
during high tides. When mudflats are exposed, salt-marsh flora rapidly
re-establishes itself and traps sediment. Offshore mudflats are
indicated by large waves breaking far offshore. Waves on shallow
mudflats are small (Bernard and LeBlanc, 1965).
Pock marks. Pock marks are small, circular-shaped depressions
or lakes. Pock marks are ephemerally filled with water and the
rounded outline may be caused by internal wave erosion and deposition
around the margins. Low ridges may appear on the flanks. Pock
marks may be parts of abandoned channels, or the swales that occur
between point bars and beach ridges, that have been partially filled
(Bernard, LeBl anc, and Major, 1962).
Point bars. A point bar ;s a lunate body of sand, silt, and
conglomerate formed on the inside of a, channel meander. The surface
morphology is one of a series of ridges and swales built up along
the inside of a growing meander (Fig. 6). Soil s in area point bars
are sandy and slity, and there is a down-grading sequence of silty
clay, silt, and fine-to-coarse sand and gravel. Trees .and brush are
common,on the point bars, and some of the bars are cultivated for
row crops (Bernard and LeBlanc, 1965).
Tidal deltas, channels, and washover fans. Tidal deltas can
be found on both the seaward and the bayward sides of tidal channels
associated with barrier island and spits. Deltas on the seaward side
of barriers. are i.ndicated by large waves breaking far offshore. Deltas
on the bayward side of barriers are in calmer waters and therefore
are seldom indicated by breakers (Bernard and LeBlanc, 1965). Delta
sediment is derived from the influx of material throuqh tidal channels
(Spearing, 1974).
~
After tidal channels are closed by deposition of sand fill, the
deltas on the seaward side of the barriers are destroyed by marine erosion.
Storm-generated wash-over currents temporarily reopen the tidal channels.
Sediment from these currents may develop into deltas and wash-over
fans on the bay side of the channels (Bernard and LeBlanc, 1965).

Deposits of wash-over material are generally thin with a
range of a few centimeters to two meters for each event. Recent
studies have shown that wash-over deposits form a significant
part of the barrier sand bodies in microtidal barrier island
regions (Re;nson, 1979).
Erosional Features
Recent-Pleistocene valley scarps. Low scarps, ranging in
height from one meter to about 7.5 meters, separate the Recent
alluvial plains of the larger streams from the higher Pleistocene
plains. These scarps disappear at the hinge line (fig. 2) between
the Recent and the Pleistocene surfaces and become higher inland .
.The scarps, that may be too low to detect by relief, can be detected
by differences between the Pleistocene and the Recent soils
(Bernard and LeBlanc, 1965).
Youthful valleys. The small streams on the Pleistocene plain
have V-shaped valleys and dense vegetation. They are in a youthful stage of development. The Late Pleistocene plain ;s very
young and has a low elevation and a gentle slope. The drainage
of the streams and small creeks is consequent to this slope and
to the depositional morphology of the sediments (Bernard, LeBlanc,
and Major, 1962).
.
Features of Doubtful Origins
Pimple mounds. Pimple ~ounds, which occur on gently sloping
sandy or silty terrains, are very common on the Pleistocene plains
of southeast Texas and coastal southwest Louisiana. The mounds
are low and circular; and they vary in diameter from a few meters
to over 60 meters (Bernard and LeBlanc, 1965).
Aronow (1979a) lists several different theories of origin
including sheetflood erosion or surface deflation by wind; accumulation of wind-transported sediments around vegetation; wind
accur.1ulationsenhanced by erosion; and IItluffing Upll of soil materials by animal burrowing. There seems to be no certainty as to
which, if any of these origins is operative, but the mounds in southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana are aligned with the area drainage
patterns suggesting erosion related origins.
Quaternary terraces. The coastal Quaternary terraces of
southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana are discussed here because
their origin involves both erosion and deposition. Each of the
Quaternary surfaces in the area--The Prairie (Beaumont), Montgomery
(Upper Lissie), Bentley (Lower Lissie), Williana (Willis), and the
Recent formations--has equivalent paired river terraces that extend
inland wjth the streams (Bernard and LeBlanc, 1965).

The Quaternary terraces t as listed by Bernard (1950), are given
below:
Recent
Modern flood plains
Deweyville Terrace

Prairie Terrace
Montgomery Terrace

Wil1iana Terrace
The river terraces of the Quaternary are paired terraces and were
formed by intermittent stream cutting that occurred during the Pleistocene glacial epoch (Quinn, 1957). The Quaternary formations were deposited during the interglacial stages when sea level was high. During
glacial periods, when sea level was low, the streams became entrenched
and valley cutting took place. This cycle continued through each
glacial and interglacial stage of the Quaternary (Fig. 10).
The older Pleistocene terraces are topographically higher than
the younger, more recent ones (Wilhelm and Ewing, 1972). This is due
to the changes of sea level and the progressive downcutting of the
streams. A regional uplift after each period of deposition occurred.
Sea level changes related to periods of valley cutting and deposition
are diagrammed in figure 11.
TECTO~IC

FEATURES

Tectonic features in this area include the topographic expressions
of salt-dome and very low, eroded fault scarps (Bernard, LeBlanc and
Majors, 1962). They make a major portion of the area's geomorphic feature in a few restricted areas such as Pasadena and Baytown.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
The Quaternary coastal plain consists of up to four major Pleistocene surfaces and a Recent surface. These surfaces .and their related
formations indicate erosional and depositional cycles which are correlated with the major Q4aternary glacial and interglacial stages
(LeBlanc, 1955). The Pleistocene formations from youngest to oldest
are: the Prairie (Beaumont in Texas), the Montgomery (Upper Lissie
in Texas), the Bentley (Lower Lissie in Texas), and the Williana
(Willis in Texas). The Recent surfaces include the Deweyville
Formation and the Modern alluvium.
Each of the Quaternary formations was layed down during one of
the interglacial stages (see Figs. 11 and 12). Before each change
in sea level, caused by the waxing and waning of the glaciers, the
whole Gulf Coast was tilted progressively seaward. This progressive
seaward tilting caused the older surfaces to have progressively greater
slopes than the younger ones (Aronow 1979b). The slopes are steeper

inland and gentler seaward. The change in gradient causes a distinct
change in grain size. This is indicated by the general upward fining
of each formation and also by the upward fining from one formation to
the next. For example, the Williana (Willis) Formation has considerably more coarse sand and gravel than the younger clayey Prairie
(Beaumont) Formation,
In general, the Quaternary formations were deposited during the
interglacial high-sea-level stages and the valleys were cut during
the glacial low-sea-level stages. This deposition-erosion cycle ;s
seen in the prominent unconformities bounding each Quaternary forma
tion (Murray 1947),
Quaternary paired terraces are the result of the sea level changes
caused by the waxing and waning of the glaciers. Changes in sea
level, with erosion and valley cutting occurring during glacial
stages, and the progressive tilting of the coastal plain caused the
older terraces to be topographically higher than the younger ones
which were formed in the eroded valleys (WilhelM and Ewing 1972).
Figure 10 illustrates this apparent reversal.

The Quaternary geologic history of the southeast Texas-southwest
Louisiana Gulf coast is a history of deposition during interglacial
stages. Erosion during the glacial stages was extensive. The total
thickness of Quaternary beds in coastal Texas-Louisiana has not been
accurately measured. Each bed thickens seaward and pinches out
inland. The lateral thickness of each formation varies considerably
with the topography of the underlying surface.

POINT BAR DEPOSITS
AND THE
MEANDERING STREAM ENVIRONMENT
Richmond Vaught and Keith Winfree
ABSTRACT
Streams may be classlfi as braided or meandering on
bash of sinuosity and channel configuration. 'The meandering
stream environment may be subdivided into a meander belt and
flan~ing flood basins.
Within the meander belt, accretion occurs
on the convex point bar while the concave cut bank is eroded.
Given the availability of contrasting grain sizes, a point bar
deposit will be graded. It may show little internal structure
in the gravelly basal portion; upward are sand units with medium
scale cross-bedding, and horizontal laminae; at the top, are
cross-laminated and laminated muddy fine sands and sandy muds t
with substantial admixed organic trash. Fine material in the basins
settle from ponded flood waters, while overbank deposits (natural
levees and crevasse splays) contribute slightly coarser material.
Flow regimes in a dynamic system, such as a meandering stream,
can be described in terms of dimensionless Reynolds and Froude
numbers, whi ch help to descri be, the tond i t ions wh kh produce the
bed forms leaving the characteristic deposits listed earlier.
Fluvial sediments can best be understood and interpreted in terms
of the'variation in the conditions that produced them.
INTRODUCTION
Due to the energy crisis the study of stream morphology has
greatly increased in importance. The most important component of
lateral accretion (widening of the meander belt) is the poi,nt bar
(Bloom, 1978); point bar!$ form excelle~t 0.11 reservoirs. This
paper will describe some of the more important aspects of meandering
streams, their function as a dynamic process, and distinguishing
characteristics.
STREAM CLASSIFICATION
Streams may be classified as meandering or braided on the basis
of their channels and sinuosity. Meanderin~ streams have a single
channel, while braided streams alternately split and rejoin to form
a network of multiple channels (figure 1). Sinuosity is a measure
of the degree of oscillation of the channel about the mean stream
direction and is defined as the ratio of channel (talweg) length
to valley lenth. Meandering streams are those with a sinuosity
greater than 1.5 (Allen, 1970).

According to Schumm (1972), meandering streams are also
characterized by predominance of suspended and mixed loads with bedload
accounting for only 11% of the total. His definition also requires
a width to depth ratio less than 40.
CHANNEL AND POINT BAR DEPOSITS
Meandering streams are among some
the most dynamic
sediment moving systems. Lateral accretion at point bars is
maintained by constant erosion of the concave outer walls (cut bank)
and deposition along the convex inner banks as a
es of ridges
(scroll bars) with alternate hollows (swales). Point bar sequences
develop as the deposits build laterally following the direction of
meander migration, roughly perpendicular to valley slope direction.
The base of the point bar sequence is a poorly-bedded gravel
deposit which may contain pebbles, cobbles, intraclasts of mud or
twigs, and bones. This is overlain by giant-ripple cross strata,
horizontal laminae, and capped by cross laminae (<lam thick). Figure 2
is a mOdification of the sequence developed by Bernard et al (1970)
for the Brazos River.
CHANNEL MARGIN AND FLOOD PLAIN DEPOSITS
The margins of the channels are bordered by wedge-shaped ridges
known as natural levees. The levees slope downward into the flanking
flood basins. Internally, the levees are composed of layers of silt
or fine sand deposited from the suspended load as sheets of flood
water spillover the banks. The river will cut channels through
levees which are known as crevasses. The water which spills through
these crevasses deposit lobes of sediment which extend into the flood
basin beyond the toe of the levee. These are called crevasse splays.
Eventually flood waters will completely inundate the adjoining basins.
This water will pond up or move slowly down valley and deposit sheets
of silt or clay from suspension. These sediments are typically wellsorted and laminated, although the lamination is often destroyed by
animal burrows or plant roots. Subaerial exposure may also produce
dessication cracks. or, if the exposure is long continued, soil
horizons, possibly caliches, may form.
MEANDER CUT-OFFS AND OXBOW LAKES
Occasionally, a river will cut off a meander thereby forming a
new channel across or behind the point bar. Since sinuosity is
inversely dependent on discharge, a less sinuous talweg can develop
high on the point bar during a flood. A chute cut-off (Allen, 1965)
occurs when the river permanently adopts this channel. Two cut banks
on OPPOSite sides of a meander may come together to cause a neck cutoff (figure 3). Once a meander is abandoned the ends of the loop
are filled and blocked with clay or silt forming a clay plug. Such
plugs can alter the direction of a river since the clay resists
erosion as the meanders migrate downstream. The oxbow lakes eventually

FINE vs. COARSE GRAINED MEANDERS
Coarse grained meanders have been described and interpreted
by McGowen and Garner (1910). The point bar facies is divided into
upper and lower units with the upper unit including chute and chute
bar sediments with large scale wedge sets and a lower unit including
. There is also no
e
large scale troughs and tabular
upward fining sequence as found in fine grained meanders. Brown(1973)
determined five distinquishing characteristics for coarse grained
meanders: (1) moderately coarse grained sand with little mud t (2)
incomplete (lower to middle) point bar sequences, (3) wedge set cross
beds (chute bars), and (4) multilateral sand bodies •.
Fine grained meanders were described by Brown (1973) with an
illustration from Bernard(1963). Brown classified four types of
sedimentary structures found in fine grained meanders:
1) moderate to large scale troughs with gravel lags
2) tabular cross-beds and some small scale trough cross-beds
3) horizontal or parallel beds with parting lineation
4) current ripple cross laminations and some ripple drift
cross-laminations •
. The fine grained meanders also have four distinquishing characteristics:
1) abundant flood plain muds and some organic matter
2) commonly complete point bar sequences
3) levees that overlie channel sands
.
4) common multistory sand bodies
Finally, the rock record (as described by Selley (1978)) provides
a sub-surface diagnosis of meandering fluvial deposits. Meander
depositsbave less porosity than bra14_ stream deposits because the .
wider range of velocities lead~ to the deposition of more fine sediment.
Meanders commonly have a sand:sha1e ratio of 50:50. Sands tend to be
fine grained and there is an overall lack of conglomerates. Cores of
the material show:
1) channel floor erosion surface
2) followed by cross-bedded point bar sands
3) that grade into cross laminated fin~r sands
4) and desiccation-cracked overbank shales.
GENERATION OF BEDFORMS
Since water has mass, a stream flowing in an open channel behaves
as a dynamic system in which two forces act: one normal and one tangential
to all surfaces. The forces are called fluid pressure and shear stress.
respectively. At fluid-solid contacts, zones of lower velocity,

boundary layers, develop. Flows may be de~cribed as laminar, where
lllayersil of fluid slide past one another, or turbulent, where secondary
flows (eddies) develop with velocities directed across or against the
mean flow direction. Turbulent flow velocities are highly variable,
irregular and only statistically predictable. Flow may be characterized quantitatively by a dimensionless number,the Reynolds number
(Nre) is given by:

Experiments have shown that a high Nre indicates tubulence while low
values are associated with laminar flow. There is a transition realm
rather than a sharp boundary between the two styles of flow. The Nre
can be thought of as the ratio between the inertial and viscous forces
acting within the fluid. At high Reynolds numbers the inertial forces
overwhelm the visceus
• This is the most important case since
most sedimentologically important flows are turbulent. Another dimensionless number, the Froude number:

relates inertial to gravitational forces. At Fr<l (low velocity to
depth ratio), the flow is said to be tranquil (subcritical). At
higher Fr the flow is rapid (supercritical) and standing waves can
form on the stream's upper surface (figure 5), On the basis of
Nre and Fr"flow regimes (Allen, 1970,p. 126) can be defined of
which subcritical turbulent and supercrittcal turbulent are important
in sedimentologic cases (Middleton and Southard, 1978; Valin, 1972;
Allen, 1970; Middleton and Briggs, 1965).
At suitably high Nre, the boundary adjacent to a grain on the
bed will separate from the grain surface producing a turbulent wake
downstream from the grain. This and the acceleration of the flow
over the grain results in pressure forces with a net downstream and
upward direction. The grain begins to move when this resultant
overwhelms the grav.itational and frictional forces holding the grain
on the bed. According to Allen (1970, p. 79), this motion is initiated
at stream power values of about 100 ergslc~2/sec. in fine (less than
0.75 ~HO.06 em») sand. Ripples form shortly after initiation of
motion and are stable over a wide range of power values. With increased power, ripples are replaced by dunes and ultimately plane beds.
Movement begins at slightly higher values for coarser sediments and
plane beds form instead of ripples. For this size range, dunes
occupy the largest stability field and are followed by higher powervalue plane beds. The 1arge stability fields correlate well with the
natural dominance of ripples in fine sand and dunes in coarse sand.
Ripples and dunes do not form at Fr greater than 1 so they are indicative of low velocity to depth ratios.
Ripples and dunes migrate as grains eroded from the gently
sloping stoss (upstream) side ava1a.nche down the steeper lee slope
Migration of relatively straight-crested forms results in tabular sets
of cross-strata, while curved ones are responsible for trough strata

41

(figure 6). Moving ripples form cross laminae (less than 1 cm thick)
while dunes produce cross beds. (Allen t 1970; Middleton and Southard,
1978; Simmons et al., 1965; Harms and Fahnestock, 1965).
Since the stoss slope rises upward and the stream surface is
slightly depressed with tranquil flow (figure 5), the now gets
shallower in a downstream direction over a bedform. The average
velocity remains the same so the Froude number increases slightly
and the boundary layer thins toward the crest. At the crest, the
boundary layer separates forming a stable eddy downstream wh1:ch
may develop reverse flow. This flow may be strong enough to form
ripples which deposit upstream dipping cross laminations which often
are preserved by the advancing dune. The detached boundary layer
passes over the eddy and rejoins the bed at the bottom of the next
stoss slope downstream where it begins to erode sediment again.
As the crest migrates the point of reattachment also
moves downstream so the downstream end of the bedform grows at the
expense of the upstream end. Therefore an over supply of sediment
to the bed is necessary for cross strata to be preserved.
t

The patterns of flow and grain mov.ement associated with bedforms
tend to sort the sediment somewhat. Since the boundary layer on the
stoss slope thins downstream, .smaller and smaller grains are exposed
to the full-velocity flow. Only those grains smaller than the
boundary layer thickness are left on the bed near the crest. The
bed load transported to the crest is deposited and sorted by grav,i'tational sliding down the lee slope. The coarsest of these grains
are found at the bottom of the slope because they encounter fewer
obstructions on the way down and are affected less by the reverse
flow coming up the lee slope from the eddy. The coarsest grains will
also tend to migrate, during deposition, to the free (least shear)
surface which results in some downstream sorting. Some of the material
from the stoss side is temporarily suspended and diffused (Brush,1965,
figure 5) beyond the crest where it settles into the stable eddy.
This produces a supply of fine material in the trough which may become
mixed with incoming {avalanching} coarser material, to decrease the
sorting, and produce the "dusty" conditiol. often observed in fluvial
sand (Brush, 1965; Jopling, 1965).
The large scale erosional and depositional pattern of the point
bar-cut bank system can be related to turbulent flow. As the stream
flows through a bend, the fluid pressure is greater on the euter bank
than over the sloping point bar surface so secondary helical flows
develop within the stream as illustrated in figure 7. One of these
flow cells removes material from the cut bank while the other builds
up the point bar. Grains move up this depositional surface until the
gravitational forces balance the fluid forces. Since these 9ravitational forces are directly proportional to the grain's mass (and
therefore size), the point bar surface is a fining upward sequence.
This size "grading is confirmed by the relative positions of the bedforms. Dunes develop in the coarse sand low on the bar while ripples
form on the upper part of the slope. The combined effects of cut
ban,K erosion and point bar accretion result in the lateral migration
which produces the characteristic vertical sequence.

TEXAS GULF COAST DELTAS
Penny Johnson and Debbie Foulk
ABSTRACT
The Brazos and Colorado rivers have both experienced epi
of rapid delta progradation within the past 10 years. Both deltas
formed as a result of human interference th the stream systems.
The Colorado delta, where it has proqraded into Matagorda Bay, is
a river-dominated (constructive) elongate delta. Progradation of
the Brazos delta into the Gulf of Mexico has developed a wave
dominated (destructive) delta. The Colorado delta exhibits the
strong influence of the river in
plain, delta front, prodel
and bay facies. In

I NTRODUCn ON

The Brazos and Colorado rivers both rhe near the
Texas border and travel about 2000 km to the southeast
form coastal deltas. Although the rivers are: similar,
deltas were deposited under different conditions. The
drastically different in form and facies distribution.

New Mexico where they
their modern
deltas are

The, drainage area of the Colorado River is near 110,100 sq km
but most of the run off comes from the lower 75,500sq km (Kanes, 1970).
The modern Colorado delta is located approximately 145 km south of
Houston, Texas. The term "modern delta" refers to the delta which
grew into Matagorda Bay starting with the 18.2 hectare (0.182 sq km)
delta first mapped in 1908(Wadsworth, 1966). The present day delta
now covers roughly. 32.375 sq km acres. Qne of the most interesting
points about the Colorado River delta is its rapid development~
because of thi~ the birth, growth and comp~~tion of the deltaic
cycle can be studied. The Colorado River delta is a hi~h-constructive
lobate-elongate delta as seen by the facies development(Brown and Fisher,
1969) •
The Brazos River system presently begins at an elevation of
122Q m in Llano Estacado of the High Plains in New Mexico, just
west of the Texas - New Mexico state line. It flows in a general westeast direction with an overall length of 2100 km (Nienaber, 1963).
The Brazos River flows on the south-western side of its valley, as
does the Colorado River. (Stricklin,1961). The stream discharges into the Gulf of Mexico west of Freeport. The annual average discharge
is estimated at 6,167,409,052 cubic meters and the silt load is approx.
24,669,636 cubic meters •. The net drainage area is 90,157.5 sq.km.
These figures are influenced by the dams on th~ river (Kanes, 1970).
The Brazos delta is classified as a
, destructive, wave
dominated delta(Galloway, 1975).

HISTORY OF THE DELTAS
Colorado River Delta
The rapid progradation
River del ta occurred
mainly in the 1
1920 l s
1930's,
removal of a 1
jam. This jam had been recorded as far back as the early 1800's.
The log jam was located about 27.35 km from the mouth of the Colorado,
and Was formed by floating debris and logs that clogged an area of
the river. With each flood
was a
build-up
organic
material and sediments. The jam in the river caused a lake to form
above the blockade and trapped coarser sediments; only verY fine
sediment was transported around the jam along new channels(Kanes, 1970).
The finer sediments filled what was once a small estuary above
Matagorda Bay(Wadworth, 1966). In 1929, the major logs were
allowing the rapid transport of sediments to the bay; the delta
started its rapid progradation.
1i'i_lnUoi:llt11,

By 1933. a second lobe with better formed distributaries had
formed on the east side of the delta. In 1935, the main channel could
no longer carry the sediment load. Sluggish movement within the
channel caused the town of Matagorda to be flooded frequently. This
prompted the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to dredge the channel
from the mouth of the Colorado, across Matagorda Bay and through
Matagorda Peninsula into the Gulf. Man's influence halted progradation
of the delta into the bay, because the Colorado River, thereafter,
discharged its load directly into the Gulf of Mexico. This caused
a forwa·rd and direct progradation of the Matagorda Peninsula.
From 1929 to 1941, the delta grew at an average rate of 2.024 sq km
per year(Wadsworth, 1966). The delta now coverssome 32.375 sq km
( See Fig. 1) •
Brazos· River Del ta
The present del ta of the Brazos River has been build1'ng only
since 1929. In 1929 the river was divertt~ from Freeport, Texas to
its present location 10.5 km west of Freeport (Kanes, 1970). The
new channel is 8.9 km long and the last 1.83 km makes an angle of
63 degreeswith the shore line(Nienaber, 1963).
The first modification of the river was a canal that was
dredged from the mouth to Galveston. Bay. A river mouth bar was
located at that time at depths of 1 - 3 m. A project was proposed
to remove the bar in 1881, but instead the U.S. Army Corp of
Engineers constructed a jettyr,'.and dikes to maintain the channel.
In 1917 the channel was dredged to 7m. Constant dredging could
not keep siltation from shoaling the channel. The diversion channel
was constructed in 1929 to stop the dredging. By 1931 the new
delttcrest-had built out seaward lOOOm. In 1932 the river channel WIS
deepened and submerged distribution began.
In 1933 parts
of the delta became subaerial
uniformity
the ope of the crest
became apparent.

In 1934 a f'lattening and a gradual loss of characteristics of the
delta configuration developed. By 1953 the subaerial portion of the
delta had developed bars and spits on both sides of the mouth
(Nienaber, 1963). The average net accretion for the new delta is
741.6 m, 3-5 m per year (Morton, 1975). Since 1948, it has been
moving in a westward direction causing various portions to
subj
to erosion. The old del just west of the Freeport jetties is
now eroding at 7.04 m per year (Nienaber, 1963). The Brazos River
has filled its old estuary and is now advancing into the low energy
environment of the Gulf (Shepard
, 1965),
SEDIMENTARY FACIES
Colorado River Delta
The four main facies found in the Colorado delta, arranged from
topographically highest to lowest~ are delta plain, delta front, prodelta,
and bay facies (Kanes, 1970). The del plain, delta front and prodel
facies are positionally analagous to the topset, foreset and bottomset
beds, respectively.of a Gilbert-type delta.
The delta plain is composed of distributary channels with natural
levees, interdistributary marshes, lakes and bays, arid beach ridges.
Washout pans, low areas which periodically trap brackish or saline
wate~often develop as bare spots on the surface of the marsh.
Given
sufficient moisture, mats of blue-green algae will grow but the
abundance of salt prevents the growth of marsh grass. Typicall~ the
marsh deposits have been disturbed by roots. The beach ridges migrate
seaward and consist mainly of tan, crossbedded,terrigenous sandy,
coquina with some clayey silt and organic material. Shells deposited
by waves are common in the upper parts of the ridges while the lower
parts are finer grained and laminated. Distributary channel fills are
composed of crossbedded sands with burrows, wood, and organic matter,
which underl ie laminated and burrowed sandy silty clays.
The delta front facies ranges from 0.5 to,2.5 m in thickness
and is composed of sand and silt deposited as the river enters the
bay. These deposits may develop slump structures as a result of
subsidence caused by compaction. Roots clays clasts, wood, organic
matter, and burrows are common in the facies, as are festoon cross
beds and horizontal laminae. Shells are rarely found in this area of
the del ta.
Prodelta facies are fine grained clays and silty clays. A
reddish-brown color is dominant and laminations are characteristic
of the facies. The thickness of the prodelta facies ranges from
0.3 to 1.7 m. Unlike the delta front, shells are very abundant in
this facies.
.

ip
49

The most distal facies is the bay facies; approximately three
to foun meters thick, it lies unconformably on Pleistocene sediment.
These sediments include grey clay and silt, clayey silt and sandy
clay, whereas the bay center is grey to reddish-brown silty clay.
The bay sediments have been greatly reworked by the fauna and
burrows are abundant.
sediments have settled very sl y
from suspension in still waters, because Matagorda Peninsula protects
the major wave action produced in the Gulf of M~xico by winds
Gul f currents.
Brazos River Delta
The Brazos Delta is characterized by poorly sorted topset
beds of laminated sand, silt, and clay. The foreset beds dip
app~ximately 1 degree and are composed of fine sand that grades
seaward into clay. The bottomset beds are also poorly developed
aid represent slow deposition of clay from the Brazos combined
with a reworking of the material from the Pleistocene deltaic
plain(Nlenaber, 1963). The delta fringe depOSits have interstratified
beds and laminae of sand and clay. Internal structuresconsist of
horizontal beds with small scale cross-beds, burrows, and con.olute
bedding. The coarsest grain site is approximately 2.50 (0.18 mm.)
(Shel ton, 197'3). Common ter.ri genous clastics are quartz, quartzi te,
chert (89%) and feldspar (9%) (Hsu, 1960). 50 miles inland, the
Brazos River contains 85% quartz types and 11% feldspars. In the
delta sand garnet is twice as abundant as staurolite and kyanite
added together. Sand deposits also contain varied amounts of
Cretaceous foraminifers(Shelton, 1973). Silt is present only in
minor amounts, with the exception of a small area near the mouth
and in the very near shore lone, immediately to the west. The sediment
types extend uniformily from the well-sorted unimodal fine sand
and coarse silt of the beach to predominantly clayey sediment
at depths of 165m Just landward of the shoal area the trend reverses
(Nienaber, 1963). The bar back has interbedded silty clay and sand
layers. Laminated or cross-bedded sands are present in the bar
crest. The bar front contains interbedded ~ilty clay and sand.
The distal part of the submerged plain contains uniformily laminated
prodelta clays(Bernard, et a1, 1970).

DEPOSITIONAL ENVIRONMENTS OF
r,ALVESTON ISLAND AND BOLIVAR PENINSULA
'ABSTRACT
Galveston Island alonq with the Bolivar Peninsula and
associated tidal deltas form a barrier of sand seoaratino
the Gulf of Mexico from West, r,alveston and East Rays, The
barrier is approximately RO.5km 10nq and oarallels the
shoreline. It developed between 5,000 and 3,000 years aqo
when the post qlacial hiqh stand
sea level was achieved.
The barrier itself is believed to be the result of the
submergence of a beach ridge of bar which has subseouently
undergone modifications. Proqradation qulfward from sediment
accumulation as a result of wave processes and spit accretion
through longshore transport of sediments are the principle
processes causing the modifications. The presence of the
barrier creates three modern depositional environments ~ 1)
back barrier or lagoonal, 2) subtidal to subaerial beach,
complex, 3) subtidal - intertidal inlet channels and deltas.
Each of these ~nvironments consists of subenvironments with
distinct sedimentary features.
.
INTRODUCTION
The purpose of thts paper is to describe modern depositional envirionments created by the r,alveston Island - Bolivar
Penensula barrier. The settinq., history, and develooment of the
barrier ,are described because an understandino of these
is baSic to the study of the modern depositional environments.
References cited provide more detailed dicussions for interested
readers.
SETTING
Galveston Island along with Bolivar Peninsula and
associated tidal deltas form a barrier of s&nd Senarating the
Gulf of Mexico from West, Galveston, and East Rays. The
barrier parallels the shoreline and is approximately 80.5km
long. It extends from Caplen on the east to San Luis Pass
on the west and is about 2.4km wide at sea level (Fios. 1
and 2). The base of the island however extends another 3.2
kilometer seaward and 30 meters lagooward (Bernard, etal.
1959~ LeBlanc and Hodgson, 1959).
Along the coast the prevailinq winds, waves, and currents
are from the southeast (Summer) and northeast (Winter).
Wave heights average 0.6 and 1.2 m respectively in water
three to fifteen meters in depth. Three to six waves m. may
occur during tropical storms. The winds, currents, and waves

produce a westerly longshore current in the area. Tides are sem;diurnal and diurnal ranging from less than 0.3 to 0.9 m. Currents
i.n Bolivar Roads and San Luis Pass (figure 1,) range between 0.5 m/sec.
to 1.6 m/sec during flood tide and average 2.1 m/sec during ebb tide.
Tides and currents are dependent on the force, direction, and duration
of the wind (Bernard, et al., 1959; LeBlanc and Hodgson, 1959).
HISTORY AND GENESIS
The last glacial lowering (Wisconsin) of sea level caused the
Trinity and San Jacinto river valleys to become entrenched. Both
valleys were then drowned when the post glacial rise in sea level
began approximately 25,000 to 17,000 years ago (Shepard, 1959).
Sea level has changed little 1n the past 5,000 years and it is in
this. time, particularly between 5,000 to 3,000 years ago that the
Galveston Island-Bolivar Peninsula barrier became established and
prograded gulfward and southwestward (Bernard, et al" 1959;
LeBlanc and Hodgson, 1959; Schwartz, 1973).
The genesis of the Galveston Island-Bolivar Peninsula and
similar barrier islands is somewhat controversial as evidence
pertaining to their origin is usually destroyed by inletcutting and
fill, washover deposition, and longshore transport. The views of
Shepard (1960) and Swift (1975) deal with the ideas of barrier
island genesis and are presented here. Additional ideas concerning
the ori gin of barrier is1 ands are outl ined by Schartz (1973).
Shepard (1960) and Swift (1975) present a composite mode of
origin which includes barrier development as a result of submergence of beach ridges, spit progradation as a result of sediments
deposited by waves, and spit accretion as a result of sediments
bei ng transported by longshore currents. Hith these processes ; n mind
the Galveston Island-Bolivar Peninsula barrier probably began as
a .small breaker bar (figure 3) or beach ridge on the southeastern
side of the mouth of Galv~ston Bay about 6.4 kilometers offshore.
The barrier emerged and grew seaward by be:lch and shoreface accretion and south westward by spit, tidal channel and tidal delta
accretion as a result of longshore drift. The bayward growth of
the barrier is by accretion of tidal deltas, washover fans, and
aeolian deposits (Bernar , et al., 1959; LeBlanc and Hodgson, 1959).
GENERAL FEATURES OF THE GALVESTON

ISLAND~BOLIVAR

PENINSULA BARRIER

The depositional morphology of Galveston Island and Bolivar
Peninsula consists of many low, parallel, and occasionally recurved beach ridges with shallow swales between the ridges. A
few hummocky sand dun.es Qccur on the beach ri dges near the west
end of Galveston Island.· These sand dunes form on the storm berm
(figure 3}.but are destroyed during severe storms (Bernard, et a1.,
1959) .

The slope of the beach averages less than three degrees. Seaward
of the beach the shoreface (figure 3) slopes approximately 3.9 m/km to
the 9 m contour. Between the 9 and 15.6 m contours the slope of the
shoreface to the toe of the Gulf bottom is less than 0.3 m per km.
Longshore or breaker bars (figure 3) occur in shallow water off the
Gulf beach. Their position, heiqht, and number vary with wave climate
(height and direction), tides, and possibly longshore currents. Depending upon tides and waves these bars move up the shoreface in the
form of giant, parallel, assymetric ripples facing inshore (Bernard.
et aL, 1959).
Although much of the upper shoreface and beach foreshore (figure 3)
sand is eroded and transported along shore and seaward during major
storms, sand is added to the storm berm during periods of relative calm,
The sand deposited in this area is derived from the east by waves reworking Late Pleistocene (Beaumont on Prairie Formation) deposits and
Holocene deltaic and coastal interdeltaic deposits along the shore.
Silt and are contributed by the Trinity and San Jacinto Rivers (Bernard,
at a1., 1959).

On the bay side of the barrier there are a number of abandoned
tidal channels or "guts" (figure 1) which trend at right angles to
the long axis of the island. Many "guts" are former swale areas between hooked spit accretions formed at the ends of the island. Tidal
currents and storm generated washover currents keep most of the "guts II
open.
DEPOSITIONAL ENVIRONMENTS
Based on the morphology of Galveston Island and Bolivar Peninsula,
the barrier may be divided into three depositional environments: 1)
the back barrier region or lagoon; 2) the subtidal 'to subaerial barrier
beach complex: and 3) the subtidal-intertidal delta and inlet channel
complex (figure 4). Each of these environments consists of a number of
subenvironments which exhibit distinct sediment facies and textural
characteristics (Walker, 1979).
Back barrier or lagoon
Hest, Galveston, and East Bays represent the back barrier or
lagoonal environment. These bay deposits are bored and churned by
organisms, with silt and clay containing shells making up most of
the sediment in the open parts of the bays. Although sand deposits
interfinger with the fine-grained lagoonal deposits of the back
barrier marsh, tidal flats, washovers, and flood tidal environments,
the lateral change from sand to silt and clay is abrupt (figure 2).
The bay environment may be subdivided into localized subenvironments
produced by variations in the influence of: 1) entering streams,
inlets, narrows and bay shores; 2) bay depth; 3) abundance of
oyster reefs (Shepard and Moore, 1959; Bernard, et al., 1959;
Bernard, LeBlanc, and Major, 1959).

Arenacious foraminifera characterize the marsh and near marsh
sediments behind the barrier. Calcareous IIRotalia" and Elphidium
are the most conmon foraminifera inhabiting the open bay sedime'nts.
Crassostrea, Ranqia, Mercenasia (Venus), and Thais are the most
contnon larger mollusks found in bay sediments (figure 5). (Bernard.
et a1., 1959; Bernard, LeBlanc. and Major, 1959).
Subtidal to Subaerial barrier beach complex
The subtidal to subaerial barrier beach complex on the Galveston
Island and Bolivar Peninsula includes the following subenvironments:
1) the subtidal zone or shoreface; 2) the intertidal zone (beach
foreshore); 3) the subaerial zone (backshore dune); and 4) the
subaerial wave-and-wind formed washover flats which extend into the
lagoon (figures 3 and 4) (Walker,1979).
There is a fining of the sand downward in the barrier (figure 2),
The barrier island sand body overlies interQedded sand and silty clay
deposits. These sand and silty clay deposits in turn overlie unconformably the Pleistocene (Beaumont Prairie Formation) (Bernard, et al.,
1959; LeBlanc, and Hodgson, 1959).
The shoreface is an environment governed by wave enery. The
amount of wave energy dissipated on the bottom increases with decreasing depth. This inverse relationship governs the textures and
sedimentary in shoreface deposits. The deposits consist of burrowed,
churned, laminated, bedded, and occasionally cross bedded shelly sands.
The initial bedding appear to conform to the bottom slope (Bernard,
et al., 1959; Walker, 1979). Anadara, Busycon, Dinocosdium, Dosonia,
Donax, t1alinia, Neotia, Oliva, and Polin;a, are the common invertebrates
found in the Gulf shore area (figure 5) (Bernard, et al., 1959).
The foreshore and backshore subenvironments of the barrier island
consist of clear well rounded, well sorted fine sand with shells and
approximately one percent silt. Laminated and very angle cross laminated
bedding is common in beach areas and the upper shoreface with burrows
being absent (figure 3). Dune sands are similar to beach sands except
for a slightly higher silt content and cross bedding being common. The
soils that make up the barrier island surface are sandy, weathered
and laminated (Bernard, et al., 1959; Shepard, 1960).
.
The wave-and-wind for.med washover flats create lobate or sheet
deposits of sand which extend into the lagoon (figure 4). The washover
deposits are thin and marked by very gently landward dipping coarse
sands that are int~rfinger with lagoonal muds. This causes an increase
in the width of the barrier and provides an environment that favors
marsh growth (Pierce, 1970; Walker, 1979~ Bernard, et al., 1959).

Subtidal-intertidal delta and inlet channel complex
The inlet and tidal delta environment is represented by San
luis Pass and Bolivar Roads (Fig. 1). The tidal channel and tidal
delta depositional environments are closely related. Their formation
is governed by tidal current processes directed normal or oblique
to the barrier. The dominant sediment in both environments is sand
with some clay. Coarser shell beds are common in the deep parts
of the tidal channels with some grading present. In abandoned tidal
channels burrowed and churned structures are common. A combination
of gulf and bay species are present in this enviromnent. The most
common invertebrates include Busycon, Dinocardium, Dosinia. Donax,
Mulinia, Noetia, Oliva, and Polinices (Fig. 5) (Bernard, et a1,
1959; Shepard, 1960; Walker, 1979).
Tiday deltas occur both bayward and seaward of San Luis Pass.
The tidal delta environment is separated into zones of ebb and flood.
Flood-tidal delta are characterized by planar cross beds, trough
cross beds, and subaqueous giant ripples. Features of the ebb-tidal
delta are controlled by both tidal currents and wave interaction.
The wave interaction produces a complex bed form distribution of
ebb oriented sand waves and modified barchan dunes. The major
difference between the ebb-tidal deposits and flood-tidal deposits
is the occurence of multidirectional >cross beds in the ebb-tidal
delta as opposed to the predominantly flood-oriented or bidirectional
cross beds of flood deltas (Walker, 1979; Bernard, et al, 1959).
SUMMARY
The importance of barrier islands to sedimentation studies is
two fold. First, they are very common along low land coasts where
active sedimentation is occuring so that one is lead to believe that
they have been common in the past (Shepard, 1960). Secondly, most
barrier islands represent a sand unit lying between two mud layers
so the would be potential traps for hydrocarbons (Bass, 1934).
The Galveston Island, Bolivar Peninsulas and associated tidal channels
and deltas form such a barrier island. rhe barrier began forming
approximately 5,000 to 3,000 years ago when the post glacial high
stand of sea level was achieved. The barrier became established
as a result of wave processes, and spit accretion and slow submergence.
This history is revealed by the off1ap sequence shown in figure 2.
The presence of the barrier creates three modern depositional
environments: 1) the back barrier region or lagoon; 2) the subtidal
to subaerial barrier beach complex; and 3) the subtidal-intertidal
delta and inlet channel complex (Fig. 4). These three environments
are made up of a number of subenvironments, each of which is
characterized by distinct sediment facies and textural characteristics.

ESTUARIES
Donna Franklin
ABSTRACT
Estuaries are classified on the basis of mode of formation,
the circulation pattern imposed by the dominant drivln~ mechanism
(wind induced curren ,tidal curren
ver currents), and the
nature of the dominant driving mechanism. Both Sabine Lake and
Galveston Bay (important estuaries along the Gulf Coast) are
typical examples of drowned river' vaney estuaries with the mouths
blocked by bars. Galveston BaY9 a result of the drowning of the
~ has sand as the dominant
Trinity and San Jacinto river vall
sediment in tidal channels and deltas~ while the lagoon is dominated by silt and clay sediments. The Sabine Lake estuary was
formed by the drowning of the Sabine-Neches valley and is very
similar to Galveston Bay. Sabine Lake 1s underlain by a deltaic
sequence in which clays and silts overlie gravelly sands. Both
Galveston Bay and Sabine Lake contain prominent internal sedimentary structures along with biofaces consisting of various foramenifera and larger invertebrates.

INTRODUCTION
This paper introduces the estuarine depositional environments
and resultant bodies of sediments; and discusses the classification of estuaries. Special reference is made to the history and
modern deposits of Sabine Lake and Galveston Bay. These are the
two major estuaries on the Upper Texas Coast.
MORPHOLOGY AND SEDIMENTS
Pritchard (1967) defined an estuary as a II semi -enclosed body
of water which has a free connection with the open sea and within
which sea water is measurably diluted with fresh water ••• 11. This
definition emphasizes the usually brackish nature of estuarine
waters, and is thus more applicable to Gulf Coast estuaries than
definitions (e.g. Friedman and Sanders, 1978, p. 277) which do .
not. Estuaries provide a first contact between sediments and the
sea. The largest part of the physical and chemical products of
the land are transferred to the ocean through estuaries. Different
kinds of estuaries are recognized on the basis of (a) mode of
formation, (b) circulation pattern imposed by the dominant driving
mechanism (e~g. wind induced currents, tidal currents, river
currents) and (c) the nature of the dominant driving mechanism
(Schubel, 1971).
According to Schubel (1971)9 there are three modes of formation of the basin; drowned valleys, bar built estuaries

64

(estuaries on secondary coasts), and estuaries produced by tectonic
processes. Secondary coasts are those that have been " •.• shaped
primarily by marine agencies or marine organi sms." (Shepard t 1963).
Obviously, all of the modes of formation listed above involve
drowned valleys, and the distinctions lie in the cause of the
drowning (eustatic sea-level rise or tectonic subsidence), and the
degree of subsequent modification by longshore drift and wave
action.
Estuarine basins usually have an original shape that 1s
either 'V' shaped or lUI shaped. The 'V' shaped basins are usually
shallow, have gently sloping bottoms, and increase in depth more
or less uniformly toward the mouth. The lUI shaped valleys are
those that have been exposed to glacial erosion. These valleys
contain rises or "si11s" at the mouth which are much shallower.
These sills may be bed-rock or drowned morainic bars. Figure 1
1s a diagramatic representation of these sills.
In the drowned river estuaries which contain bars, a free
passageway to the open sea 1s obtained by breaking these barriers
by one or more inlets which are usually narrow. Total fresh water
input is usually low and the depth is very shallow. Estuaries
along the upper Gulf Coast exemplify this type of formation, that
is. the drowned river val1e:t with a bar built across the mouth.
The second basis used for the classification of estuaries is
the nature of the dominant driving mechanism moving and mixing
waters: wind, tidal currents, or river currents. The wind is
usually the mos t important mixing mechanism ina drowned river
estuary with a bar built across the mouth. In a river dominated
estuary~ " ••• the mixing is mostly due to the breaking of unstable
internal waves on a sharp interface between fresh and salt water."
(Schubel. 1971).
According to Schubel (1971), modern Gulf Coast estuaries
began forming approximately 18,000 years ago. At this time, sea
level was approximately 125 meters below present day sea level
and the continental shelves were exposed. Within 9,000 years, the
sea rose progressively until it was about 20 meters below present
day sea level. As sea level continued to rise, the sea progressively covered river channels and estuaries, perhaps without bars,
moved landward. The rate of the rise in sea level then slowed
greatly. The rate of sediment influx, dependent on climate ~nd
the availability of sediment,. determines the rate at which the
estuary will be destroyed. Circulation within the estuary is also
a factor in the life span of the estuary, particularly as sediment
introduced from the ocean is affected. If sea level remains
constant, estuaries may fill quickly with sediment and become
deltaic plains.

GULF COAST ESTUARIES
The two most important estuaries along the Gulf Coast are Sabine
Lake and Galveston Bay. Sabine Lake covers approximately 100 square
miles. The Neches and Sabine river deltas are in the northern part
of this area and the Trinity river delta is in the western part of
this area. The sediments of Pleistocene deltas of these rivers lie
beneath a recent fluviatile and marsh deposit. The uppermost Pleis
sediment is a stiff,
colored chy'i
n1
iron or lime concentrations. Some places in the uppermost oxidi
layer are very fine sands or silts. The recent sediments consist
of grayish Or blackish clays and silts with grayish or whitish sands.
Rise in sea level caused sediments to be deposited sequentially. The
top layer consists of fine sands, silts, and clays and the basal layer
"this
consists of gravel and coarse sands Going towar~s the
depositional sequence grades ••. into a thicker deltaic sequence where
clays and silts are more common and overlie gravelly sands."(Kane,1959)
'i

SABINE LAKE
In Sabine lake and Pass, bottom sediments consist of very fine
sandy. and silty mud, or silty and clayey mud, except for areas of
the lake near the mouths of the Neches and Sabine rivers and in
some nearshore areas of the pass. tn these areas there are larger
amQunts of fine sand(Fig. 2). The fine sand, which is the coarsest
lithologic type, also occurs " ... in an alternatinq narrow and wide
belt extending from the mouth of the Neches River to the Southeast
Louisiana shore of the lake." (Kane, 1959) The qreater part of the
Sabine Lake bottom sediments consists of mud with'the next most
common lithofacies being fine sand.
Minor internal sedimentary structures, both distinct and indistinct, occur in the sediments of Sabine Lake. (See Fig. 3).
Mixed structures (burrow holes or tubes) are the main type present
in the uppennost layer. According to Kane (1959)., the next most
abundant type of structure is the fine homogenous structures (uniform
massive structure) along the Southwest shore. In the northern and
western parts of Sabine Lake are coarse and fine textured homogenous
structures. A small area of irregular (discontinous) layers are in
the lake(Fig. 4) just above the head of Sabine Pass (Kane 1959).
BIOFACIES
Six taxa of microforms, some occurinq toqether, characterize
four distinct kinds of areas within Sabine Lake. These microforms
are Ha lo hragmOides .. Mi11annina, Anmobaculites sp., "Rotalia"-Elph1d1um,
and Hi io 1dae. Of all the microforms identified in the area, particular emphasis was placed on the Foraminifera. The HClSlo phragm01desM11iann1na biofacies occurs as a narrow irregular band a jacent to the
eastern and western shorelines of Sabine lake. The Ammobacul1tes bio~
facies covers a large, central north-south e10nqate area in Sabine

southern portion or the lake. The M11101tdae biofacies (Fig. 5) is one
of the few distinctions between the Sabine lake environment and the
Gulf of Mexico (Kane 1959).

GALVESTON BAY
Galveston Bay is very similar to Sabine lake. Galveston Bay is
a specific example of a
ver
ley with a
built across
mouth. "Galveston Bay resulted largely from the drowning of the Trinity
and San Jacinto valleys which were entrenched durinq the previous l1inq
and low sea level stages" (Kane 1959). The surface of Galveston Island
consists of very well sorted, fine to very fine sand. Seaward of the
30 foot contour, the bottom consists of 51 It and clay with shell s. The
dominant sediment in the tidal channels and deltas is sand, Sand is also
present on the edges of the backside of the island. Silt and clay
containing shells make up most of the sediments in the open parts of
the bays and lagoons (Bernard. et a1., 1959). Most of the bay and
lagoonal deposits near the tidal passes are bedded and laminated sand
and clay. rn the backshore, beach crest, an~ foreshore area the most
common depositional structures are very low angle crossbeddinq and laminations(Sernard, et a1.,1959). As in the. Sabine lake area, Foraminifera
are important in the Galveston Bay estu~ry. The Rotalia-Elrhidium
association is found in Galveston Bay. SQme of the largernvertebrates
found in the bay area are the littorina, Dinocardium, Po1inices, Oliva,
and Donax (Bernard, et a1., 1959).

SALT TECTONICS AND SEDIMENTATION
GULF OF MEXICO
Keith Winfree
ABSTRACT
The Gulf of Mexico is apparently underlain by oceanic crust
which probably formed by rifting and sea floor sp~eading in the Triassic.
During the Jurassic, thick layers of salt were deposited 1n
rift
system. This
t was mobil;
during
ary when
region began
to subside as the basin received great volumes of terrigeneous sediments.
The salt 1s flowing oceanward in response to the loading of the continental shelf and consequently deforms the rapidly accumulating sediments.
The Sigsbee scarp is interpreted to be the front of the
t miss.
I NTRODUCTI ON
Seismic studies of the Gulf of Mexico
shown how salt tectonics
can affect contemporaneous sedimentation. Throughout the Cenozoic, mobile
layert of salt have intruded, warped, and fractured accumulating sediments.
The purpose of this paper is to review some of the current ideas on the
origin and movement of this salt.
DEPOSITIONAL PROVINCES
The Gulf can be subdivided into depos·it10nal provinces. Stratigraphic
units for the bottom sediments were defined on the basis of widespread
acoustics charateristics and lithologic continuity as part of the Beep
Sea Drilling Project (Ladd, et al., 1976).
Abyssal Gulf
The abyssal Gulf is the portion below 2930m (1,600 fathoms)
depth and is described as a hemipelagic environment because of the
abundance of land-derived sediment. It is boun~on the north by the
Sigsbee scarp, on the west and south by the Mexican continental slope,
and on the east by the Florida and Yucatan platforms. The abyssal
Gulf can be divided into the Mississippi cone, the Sigsbee plain, and
the Sigsbee wedge. The Mississippi cone 1s a fan-like mass of unbedded
or distorted Pleistocene and Holocene sediments derived from the
MiSSissippi delta system. This sediment grades westward into the stratified turb1ditesof the Sigsbee plain. The Holocene laps on the Sigsbee
wedge- on· the ·southwest ·margin Of the cine •. Thewedge is a seismically
unstratified deposit extending from the 3600m (2000 fathoms) depths of
the plain to the base of the Sigsbee scarp where it is abrubtly terminated.

surface of the plain. It is thought to be the result of several
gravity induced flows from the unstable northern continental slope.

There are abundant salt diapirs on the plain and seismic profiles

Mexican Ridges units are thi
in
northwestern
plain indicating a sediment supply possibly rel
the laramide
Orogeny. The Mexican Ridges unit shows great~st thickness in
rim synclines of the diapirs, so salt movement must have been
initiated by the early Tertiary. The Sigsbee unit is of variable
thickness on the plain~ filling the bathymetric lows to produce
a smooth terrain. It onlaps the Tertiary from the east, indicating
a major shift in sediment source area.
Mexican Continental Slope
The northernmost portion of the Mexican continental slope is
thought to represent the southwest edge of the geosyncline since
it greatly resembles the northern slope. The rest of the slope
is marked by slightly anticlinal, parallel features which have
been interpreted as decollement structures (Wilhelm and Ewing, 1972).
There is no evidence of associated salt. The southern portion of
the slope is similar to the northern in that sedimentation was
controlled by salt tectonics. However, the deformation does not
reach the floor of the plain and there is no counterpart to the
Sigsbee scarp_ The salt is connected to the Isthmus Saline basin
and extends downdip below the Sigsbee plain. The salt body which
affected structure and deposition in the Mexican slope is not
continuous with the northern salt body (Wilhelm and Ewing 1972).
SUGGESTED ORIGIN OF GULF
The origin of the Gulf and the salt in part1cular is not
well understood. On the basis of anomalous seismic velocities,
the basement is believed to be oceanic crust, presumably formed
by rifting and sea floor spreading in the Triassic. Some authors
maintain that the Afro-South American plate was involved directly
in the rifting while others feel that the Yucatan block was there
instead. The rifting began at a triple junction located at the
mouth of the present Mississippi embayment. The eastern arm was
connected by a series of transform faults to the Atlantic rift
system and the western arm opened a seaway from the southwest.
The MiSSissippi embayment may represent the failed northern arm.
Studies of the Red Sea rift have shown that the area closest to
the rift is topographically high as a result of thermal uprising
(Figure 2). Such a structure 9 if present, could act as a restric-

to fit the Gulf situation since there are two unconnected salt

since the Tertiary. This has produced subsidence of the oceanic
and thinned continental crust so that the crust under the Gulf is
now 5.5 kilometers below that of the Atlantic. As geosynclinal
deposition continues, the salt also subsides until it is mobilized by
the heat and pressure conditions. At first, the salt moves laterally
into pillows which form at the expense of adjacent withdrawal
basins, in which sediments collect. Individual layers show varied
thicknesses since they thin over the pillows. Kupfer (1976) has
called this the "horizontal phase" since the ratio, of horizontal
to vertical movement is 3:1 (figure3). These pillow-basin systems
usually have a wavelength on the order of 6-20 km.
The "active phase il occurs as the half-wavelength to height
ratio of the salt mass approaches one. At the depths necessary
for salt mobilization, the sediments are compacted and, therefore,
quite dense. This produces a bouyant force which is strong enough
to allow the salt to pierce overlying sediments. Subsidence continues
in the withdrawal basins as more and more salt is removed. This,
coupled with the upward motion of the salt, produces a syncline
in the immediately overlying sediments. At the sea floor, troughs
occur over these synclines which collect ever-thickening layers·
of sediment. Over the rising salt, layers will be thinned or
even eroded if the salt is rising fast enough relative to the rate
of basin subsidence. This stage is marked by a compression of the
troughs until the wavelength is only 4-10 km.
During the "vertical phase", the synclines converge against
the now-vertical walls of the salt stock. The salt has probably
ceased to move upward while the sediments continue to subside
around it. The IIfinal phase" is reached once active geosynclinal

must be caused
by external processes such as,groundwater circulation or erosion.

77

Groundwater may remove a portion of the top to form a caprock.
This can disturb the equilibrium as can continuing compaction of
the surrounding sediments. At the surface, erosion may remove
both salt and newly deposited muds and sands which would cause
sink (Kupfer,
the salt, heavier than uncompacted sediments,
et a1., 1976).

INTERNAL SHEAR ZONES
Recent studies of tha i
1 struc
of northern Louisiana
salt mines have focused on shear zones which are i
as
t. A single salt
boundaries between spine-like bodies of
stock is composed of many of these spines which seem to be emplaced
at different rates and times. By definition, the external boundary
of a diapir is a fault zone. These faul
are marked by two
shear zones: a shale sheath and a sheared salt sheath. The
shale is a type of fault gouge derived from the surrounding
sediments. It grades laterally outward into diapiric shale
and interlayered breccias. This deformation may extend hundreds
of meters away from the boundary. The salt sheath is marked
by parallel light and dark bands which are folds It/hich have been
intensively sheared. A second type of shear zone forms when one
spine is emplaced against a pre-existi~g spine trapping the shale
sheath in between. Once the top of the salt column has stabilized,
lower mobile spines will try to move up around the sta~e mass.
However, the rigid nature of the surrounding compacted sediments
restricts any sideways motion. The mobile spine lifts the stable
one and slides up alongside it incorporating the shale sheath.
This shale is deformed with later.movements to produce the tight,
irregular folds characteristic of diapirs. Other shear zones
occur where salt shears salt but they are hard to recognize
.
(Kupfer, 1976).
TECTONIC SIGNIFICANCE OF SALT STRUCTURES
Characteristic structures are formed in the diapirs and
surrounding sediments as the salt moves. Extrusive salt plugs
are vertical or final phase structures. They typically have
steep flanks, flat tops, well developed caprock, and often show
truncated beds as a result of the late Wisconsin lowered sea level.
Post-glacial and Peorian sediments are generally absent over these
diapirs which are usually found inland, on the shelf, or on the
uppermost slope. Other salt structures have a doughnut shaped
top with the top salt surface shallowest below the central depression.
The surrounding ridges are usually layered Pl,eistocene clays.
This feature is a crestal graben formed in the tensional 'environment
over the rising diapir (Figure 4.). The lower continental slope
has a rolling topography with little relief. The salt here forms
broad domal swells and shallow withdrawal basins. These features
have a diameter in the range of
kilometers. Near the Sigsbee

t

78

scarp, the swells show
landward of the crests
to Lehner (1969) "this
ward under the load of

a marked asymmetry with fairly flat beds
and steeply tilted ones seaward. According
pattern suggests a salt wave moving oceanthe advancing clastic wedge."

In the central part of the northern slope these waves form
a system with wavelengths of 28-37 kilometers and amplitudes of
about 600 meters. These swells are early

phase.
of this system is the 5igsbee scarp which is now interpreted as
a wall of salt moving over the younger deposits
51
plain. This movement is accomplished by successive emplacement
of swells (Figure 5.). The driving force is the differential in
sediment loading between the shelf and the slope. This is reflected
in the increasing tectonic maturity from the scarp northward
to the shelf where greater thicknesses of sediments have produced
the chimney-like diapirs characteristic of the final phase.
The salt movement has formed several down-to-the ocean fault zones
which are known as growth faults. They usually show one or mor.e~
periods of movement and then are replaced by a new oceanward set.
The downthrown sides are often rotated into the fault indicating
movement along concave planes. These faults show no direct
relation to individual diapirs but seem instead to be extensional
features caused by the flow of the salt. Figure 6 is a northsouth cross-section showing t~ gross structure of the geosyncline,
growth faults, and the differences in tectonic styles from north
to south.

I NTRODUCTI ON·
The term "chenier" comes from the French "chene", meaning oak. referring to the stand of large oak trees which characteristically grow
on the ridges. The American Geological Institute defines a chenier as
"a long, low (3-6 m. high), narrow, wooded beach ridge or sandy hummock,
forming roughly parallel to a prograding shoreline seaward of marsh
and mud-flat deposits (such as along the coast of southern Louisiana),
enclosed on the seaward side by fine-grained sediments, and resting on
. peat or clay. It is well drained and fertile, often supporting large
evergreen oaks or pines on higher areas; its width varies from 45 to
450 m. and its length may be several tens of kilometers."(A.G.I .• 1972).
A chenier plain is the accumlation of chenie~ separated by mud or
marsh flats.
The outstanding chenier development of the Louisiana coast is west
of the Mis~issippi Delta. The plain extends 110 miles along the coast
and is more than 20 miles wide. The east~rn edge of this chenier plain
is bordered by the MiSSissippi l21ta. The western boundary merges with
the barrier islands of the Texas coast. The chenier ridges have more
relief than the adjacent mud-flat or marsh deposits. These ridges follow the smooth to slightly curvilinear trends of the former shoreline.
The more extensive mud-flat or marsh deposits separating the chenier
rldges are related to the increased river discharge from the east.
Because of shifts in the Mississippi Delta discharge during the past
3,000 years, repetitive accumulation of chenier ridges and mud-flat
sequences result. On the average, this chenier plain has had an
historic growth rate near 3,~5 meters per year.

+
82

This classic chenier plain consists of three basic physiographic
units: 1.) vegetated marsh; 2.) water bodies including ponds, lakes,
creeks, streams, and tidal inlets; 3.} chenier ridges. The ridges
range in elevation from several inches to more than ten feet. The
thickness of the sediments making the ridges are between two and fifteen feet and the width is between 100 and 1,500 feet. Most commonly~
a chenier ridge is about seven feet thick and 600 feet wide. After
Riley (1959) recognized
studying 127 chenier ridges, Bryne, LeRoy
seven distinct, environmentally
led
itional
les based
on lithology and faunal relationships in the post-Pleistocene deposits.
They are, in order of increasing age: 1.) chenier sand and shell hash;
2.) marsh organic clay and silt; 3.) baymouth silt; 4.) bay bottom and
mud-flat clayey silt; 5.) gulf bottom silty clay; 6.) gulf bottom sand
and silty clay; 7.) basal transgressive deposi . Therefore, the
typical chenier ridge does not simply represent a storm deposit, rather,
most chenier ridges are winnowed, that is to say wind sorted deposits
representing a moderately long continued set of depOSitional conmtions
fundamentally different from the conditions leading
the progradation
of marsh or mud-flat deposits.
Carbon-14 datings of shell material and wood fragments from chenier
deposits have allowed the reconstruction of the basic sequence of
chenier plain development. Shells in ~;ttle Chenier, the farthest landward, well developed chenier, have a carbon-14 age of 2,775 years. More
than 15 major and minor cheniers have developed in the area seaward of
little Chenier and there has been no change in sea level since that deposition.
The conditions necessary for the development of cheniers are
abundant sediment supply, low to moderate wave energy, and land-sea
stability. There must also be a periodic variation in sediment supply.
These conditions are best met near the mouths of large rivers in areas
with broad continental shelves. The chenier plai~s form down drift
from the river source area. If wave energy is high, silt and clay size
sediments are carried offshore rather 'than being deposited along the
shoreline.
'
The first phase in chenier development requires a sufficient
supply of sediment from the source river. Because the silt and clay
fraction has not been removed, a mud-flat of relatively unsorted sediment results under these conditions, the sediment supply is sufficient
to prograde the shoreline~
The area where sediment is introduced into the marine environment
is occasionally changed becuase of shifts in the distributary pattern
of the delta. Therefore, the rate of deposition is changed in the
adjacent chenier. The rate of progradation is increased if the river
outlet is near the chenier plain. But, if the shift in discharge is
away from the plain, progradation may cease and there may be a stabilization or a retreat of the shoreline. When these periods occur, the

sand ridges develop and may be driven landward over the marsh. Reworking accompanies shore stabilization and sorts out silt and clay. This
silt and clay is then transported seaward leaving the sand and shell
as beach or dune ridges. Additional sand is sometimes introduced
during this time by littoral and longshore currents. The size of the

The areas separating the cheniers are occupied by salt marsh if
nearer to the beach or freshwater marsh. The marsh surface builds up
to a high spring tide level. In some places river floodplain sediments
raise the level of the marsh areas and the cheniers may be buried. The
width of the marsh areas between the cheniers
fl"om a few tens of
yards to several hundred yards. They contain appreciable organic matter,
silt and clay. The sediments of the sea floor adjacent to the chenier
plain are interbedded sand and silty clay. The farther seaward we
move the less sand due to the diminishing influence of wave action.
Chenier internal stratification usually dips gently in laminations
(less than 10°). The dip may be directed toward the ocean if formed
on the foreshore or toward land if formed by washover. Shells are
abundant throughout the deposit in layers up to several inches thick.
Leaching may cause the shell content to be concentrated in the upper
few feet. The grain size characteristically increases from the base to
the top (Byrne et a1, 1959).
There are similarities in the construction of the ridges associated with barriers and cheniers because both are shaped by similiar
processes. The differences lie in the quantity and types of sediment
supplied to the depositional area. Low coastal energy and abundance
of fines contribute to the deposition of mudflat and marsh along the
shoreline. Along barrier island shores the fines are trapped in the
lagoon or are transported offshore and do not accumulate along the
shoreline.
.
The merger of the Southwestern Louisiana chenier plain and the
barrier islands of the East Texas coast has not been studie d in
complete detail. The transition results from the diminished supply of
silt and clay to the Texas barrier coast and the lack of mudflat and
marsh deposition along the shoreline. The change from ehenier to coast
to barrier coast is the common transition downdrift from a major source
of sediment supply.

as the site of mudflat deposition shifts laterally.
Block E - I show that when the coast has rema:;ned stable for

abundant sediment supply, rapid progradation occurs and the new position
of erosion and stability become established .

Type II - Mud flats are found on the updrift side of the Calcasieu Pass
and the updrift side of Sabine Pass. Sediments are contributed by local sources such as the Mermentau and Calcasieu
Rivers, as well as eroding marsh outcrops to the east.
Type III- This is the sand and shell beach that appears in the western
section of the plain and reflects a general increase in
stability in this direction. Holly Beach is the first true
sand beach west of the Mississippi Delta. Erosion is prevalent along this area and the chenier ridges are truncated.
Marsh sediments Ire exposed along this section due to erosion.
Transgression is occuring to the west, at Johnson's Bayou,to
the expense of this coastline. Johnson's Bayou beach area is
the closest approximation to the chenier ridge environment of
the past.
