This report documents a cultural resource inventory conducted on 501 acres near Wright Patman Lake in Bowie County,
East Texas. Work was conducted at the request of the Piney Woods Project Office of the United States Army Corps of
Engineers, Fort Worth District (USACE). The USACE has proposed timber harvesting within the parcels and in
compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, the inventory was undertaken to ensure that any
cultural resource sites would be considered in planning and conducting the undertaking. Archeological fieldwork was
conducted from August 25–30, 2011 and included a 100 percent pedestrian inventory accompanied by intensive and
systematic shovel testing. Archeologists manually excavated 257 shovel tests as a discovery tactic and placed an
additional 30 shovel tests on sites and around isolated positive shovel tests for delineation. Of these 287 shovel tests,
only three isolated tests were positive, returning four prehistoric flakes. All subsurface artifacts were collected and will
be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory. Previously recorded archeological site 41BW27 was
investigated but all shovel tests were negative. It is not known whether the site is mis-plotted or has been completely
eroded and the NRHP eligibility of 41BW27 is unknown.

Abstract
This report documents the substantive findings and management recommendations of a cultural
resource inventory conducted on two tracts of land, totaling 501 acres, in Bowie County in East
Texas. The two inventory parcels are near Wright Patman Lake. Work was conducted at the
request of the Piney Woods Project Office of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Fort
Worth District (USACE). The USACE has proposed timber harvesting within the parcels and,
in compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, the inventory was
undertaken to ensure that any cultural resource sites located on the parcels would be considered
in planning and conducting the undertaking.
Archeological fieldwork was conducted in one session from August 25–30, 2011. Fieldwork
included a 100 percent pedestrian inventory accompanied by intensive and systematic shovel
testing. Ecological Communications Corporation (EComm) archeologists manually excavated
257 shovel tests as a discovery tactic and placed an additional 30 shovel tests on sites or
around isolated positive shovel tests for delineation. Of these 287 shovel tests, three tests were
positive; all three were isolated positive tests. EComm archeologists recovered four prehistoric
flakes within the three positive tests. All subsurface artifacts were collected and will be curated
at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory.
One previously recorded archeological site, 41BW27 was investigated. Two possible locations
of this site were tested with all shovel tests negative. As it is not known whether the site is misplotted or completely eroded, the NRHP eligibility of 41BW27 is unknown.

Project Description
1.1	The Undertaking
The United States Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District (USACE) is responsible for
managing certain federally-owned lands in East Texas in association with lakes, reservoirs
and navigable waterways. These management responsibilities include 45,063 acres at Wright
Patman Lake (acreage is outside conservation pool). Much of this acreage is forested by mature
pine and pine-hardwood stands. In conjunction with the existing management plans for the
several reservoirs and in accordance with accepted silviculture methodologies, the USACE
has planned certain management areas for selective timber thinning. Commercial thinning
removes marketable trees in uneven-aged stands (not clear-cut) through single tree selection.
Removal of crop trees often disturbs the ground surface, but extensive subsurface disturbance
is not common.
While planning and conducting undertakings that have the potential to affect historic properties,
the USACE must take such resources into account; and in compliance with Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966 as amended through 1992 (P. L. 89–665
et seq.), the inventory was authorized by the USACE to identify any archeological sites,
buildings, structures, or other resources that may be eligible for nomination to the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP). All inventories were conducted on lands owned by the
federal government and managed by the USACE.

1.2 	Location
The project area is composed of two separate parcels located at Wright Patman Lake in Bowie
County, Texas. Together, the two parcels total 501 acres. The smaller parcel, Anderson Creek,
encompasses 210 acres, while the Corley parcel totals 291 acres. Both parcels are on the
Corley, Texas USGS 7.5’ topographic quadrangle.
Wright Patman Lake is located on the Sulphur River about 18 kilometers (km) southwest of
Texarkana in Bowie and Cass counties (Figure 1-1). The far upstream portions of the reservoir
extend into Morris, Titus, and Red River counties. Initially known as Texarkana Reservoir,
the lake was renamed in the late 1970s in honor of the East Texas congressman (Breeding
2002). The dam was constructed between 1948 and 1957 for flood-control, conservation, and
recreational purposes. Elevation of the conservation pool typically varies seasonally; normal
elevation in winter is 220.6 feet (ft) above mean sea level (amsl), or 67.2 meters (m) amsl, and
227.5 ft amsl (69.3 m amsl) in summer. Flood storage capacity is 259.5 ft amsl (79.1 m amsl).
During the summer, the lake can cover 33,750 acres; the normal winter conservation pool is
20,300 acres. Both parcels totaling 501 acres are currently planned for timber thinning.

1.2.1 Anderson Creek Parcel
The Anderson Creek parcel is located in Bowie County north of the Sulphur River, about 6 km
west of Maud, 15 km south of New Boston, and 13 km north of Douglassville. Totaling 210
acres, this parcel is situated on the eastern edge of the Anderson Creek floodplain. The tract
measures approximately 2,560 m north-south by 1,200 m east-west (Figure 1-2). It is located
on the Corley USGS 7.5’ topographic quadrangle. Elevation varies from 230 ft amsl (70.1 m
amsl) at the floodplain on the western boundary to above 300 ft amsl (91.4 m amsl).

1.2.2 Corley Parcel
The Corley parcel is Bowie County north of the Sulphur River, about 5 km southwest of
Maud, 17 km south of New Boston, and 12 km north of Douglassville. Totaling 291 acres, this
parcel straddles Panther Creek from just before it combines with Moss Creek to just before it
releases into the Anderson Creek floodplain (Figure 1-2). The tract measures approximately
2,010 m east-west by 1,380 m north-south. It is located on the Corley USGS 7.5’ topographic
quadrangle. Elevation varies from 233 ft amsl (71.0 m amsl) at the bottom of Panther Creek
to above 260 ft amsl (79.2 m amsl).

1.3 	Natural Environment
The project area is located in the Piney Woods region of East Texas. Forested areas in the
region include secondary growth and mature pine and pine-hardwood stands. Pine stands
observed during the field inventory typically consisted of loblolly (Pinus taeda), shortleaf
(Pinus echinata), and longleaf (Pinus palustris) pines. Hardwood trees were predominantly
various oaks, including southern red oak (Quercus falcate) and white oak (Quercus alba),
and the American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis) (Diggs et al. 1999). Figures 1-3 and 1-4
illustrate typical landscape views for the project area.

Figure 1-3. Typical vegetation encountered in upland settings.

Wildlife species common to the area include whitetail deer (Odocoileus virginianus), red fox
(Vulpes vulpes), bobcat (Felis rufus), squirrel (Sciurus spp.), raccoon (Procyon lotor), opossum
(Didelphus virginiana), nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), nutria (Myocastor
coypus), river otter (Lutra canadensis), and mink (Mustela vison) (Davis and Schmidly
1994). Lake habitats support a variety of turtles (Figure 1-5), frogs, and snakes, as well as
largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides salmoides), flathead (Pylodictis olivaris) and channel
(Ictalurus punctatus) catfish, white bass (Morone chrysops), white (Pomoxis annularis) and
black (Pomoxis nigromaculatus) crappie, and bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) and other
sunfish (Thomas et al. 2007). Bird species include the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker
(Picoides borealis), bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), osprey (Pandion haliaetus),
bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), white pelican (Elecanus

1.4 	Geology and Soils
1.4.1 Underlying Geologic Formations
The geologic formations of the project area consist of the Wilcox groups undivided of the
Eocene, and Alluvium of the Pleistocene. Within these groups, varying formations compose
the underlying bedrock.
The underlying bedrock of the two parcels consists mainly of the Wilcox group undivided
of the Eocene, with Alluvium of the Pleistocene at the western edge of the Anderson Creek
parcel. The Wilcox group undivided consists of sandy, lignitiferous, littoral clays that are crossbedded with river sands, compact non-calcareous clays, and stratified deltaic silts. The basal
beds of this formation “mark the transition from marine muds and silts of the underlying Wills
Point formation to coarser, littoral, deltaic, and non-marine deposits of the Wilcox” (Sellards et
al. 1990:573). This formation has a thickness of approximately 1,260 ft (384 m). Also present
within the Anderson Creek parcel is the Pleistocene Alluvium. This formation is constructed
of floodplain and channel deposits with sand, silt, clay, and gravels. It is approximately 30 ft
(9 m) thick and includes the lowest terrace deposits near floodplain level (Sellards et al. 1990).

1.4.2 Soil Formations
Soils within the survey areas include Adaton-Muskogee, Annona, Ashford, Blevins, Sardis,
Sawyer, Thenas, Wooodtell, and Wrightsville-Rodessa series, and an additional unnamed series
(Soils Survey Staff 2011). All soil descriptions are from the Natural Resources Conservation
Service (Soil Survey Staff 2011).
Soils within the Anderson Creek parcel include Adaton-Muskogee complex, Blevins, Sardis,
Sawyer, Thenas, and Woodtell series, as well as an unnamed Udorthents series (Table 1-1).
The Woodtell series is shallow with clay at 15 cmbs and sandy loam above. The unnamed
Udorthents series is completely disturbed, with no original ground surface remaining. The
remaining soils are silty or sandy loams to a depth below 80 cmbs.
Soils within the Corley parcel include Adaton-Muskogee and Wrightville-Rodessa complexes,
Annona, Ashford, Sawyer, Thenas, and Woodtell series (Table 1-1). The Annona and Woodtell
series are shallow with clay at 15 to 25 cmbs and sandy. The Ashford series is characterized by
clay at the surface. The remaining are silty or sandy loams to a depth below 80 cmbs.

Cultural Context
2.1	Previous Investigations
A map and records search was conducted on July 22, 2011 using the Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas online database, maintained by the Texas Historical Commission (THC). This search
determined that one previously recorded archeological site is plotted within the 501 acres of
the currently defined project area. The 1949 National Park Service (NPS) River Basin Survey
recorded this site, 41BW27, within the boundaries of the currently defined Corley parcel. No
other surveys have been conducted within one mile of the parcel and no other sites have been
recorded within one mile of the Corley parcel. The location of site 41BW27 was revisited
during the inventory of the parcel.
About 900 meters to the west of the Anderson Creek parcel and along Anderson Creek, the
NPS recorded one site during the River Basin Survey. This site, 41BW26, was recorded as an
“open village” about 5–10 acres in size. In 1997, Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI) conducted a survey
of about 450 acres located to the north of the Anderson Creek parcel. This survey recorded
two sites within one mile of the Anderson Creek parcel. Both of these sites, 41BW625 and
41BW626, were recorded as unknown prehistoric lithic scatters.
All four sites located within one mile of the current project area, including the one site within
the current project area, are summarized in Table 2-1.

2.2	Cultural Framework
The prehistoric cultural framework in the Northeast Texas region has been recorded by many
archeological investigations and includes the Paleoindian period, Archaic and Woodland
periods, and periods of Caddo horticultural adaptation. The cultural framework discussed
below has been adapted from Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993) and Perttula (1993a, 1993b, 1995,
2004).

2.2.1 Paleoindian Period
Generally, there is a lack of data relating to the Paleoindian period (ca. 9500–7000 BC) in
Northeast Texas. While many projectile points such as Clovis, Plainview, Dalton, Scottsbluff,
and San Patrice have been recovered, most were isolated, mixed, or surface finds or found in
excavations of later contexts (Perttula 2004). The distribution of artifacts suggests that most
sites occur within the valleys of major stream basins and resource-rich areas.
Regardless of the paucity of evidence, generalizations have been made regarding settlement
mobility and subsistence patterns during the Paleoindian period in Northeast Texas. Evidence
suggests that groups occupied small camps and used a generalized toolkit, and that they were
more likely to be highly mobile hunters and gatherers rather than specialized large-game
hunters (Perttula 2004).

2.2.2 Archaic Period
The Archaic period (ca. 7000–200 BC) is subdivided into the Early (ca. 7000–4000 BC),
Middle (ca. 4000–2000 BC), and Late Archaic (ca. 2000–200 BC), although in the Northeast
region of Texas, reliable dating is not yet available to unequivocally substantiate these different
periods. During the Early Archaic, sites are much smaller and more widely distributed,
suggesting high group mobility within large territories. Archeological data also suggest a
generalized hunting and gathering subsistence strategy that is focused on the exploitation of a
wide variety of resources. Although most Early Archaic sites are only briefly used, they are apt
to be concentrated in the larger drainage areas in the region (Perttula 2004).
The Middle Archaic is characterized by considerably larger sites within major basins in the
region, a more diverse hunting toolkit, the use of ground and polished stone tools, and the
increased use of plant foods as indicated by grinding implements and burned rock features.
Possible hearths, ovens, and burned rock concentrations in the region suggest processing and
cooking of plant resources was important (Perttula 2004).
Throughout Northeast Texas, Late Archaic-period sites are relatively common along major
streams and springs in the uplands and on tributary drainages. Population density may have
peaked during the Late Archaic, as evidenced by the apparent increase in the number of sites and
greater distribution of sites over the landscape. The large number and widespread distribution
of sites also suggests limited group mobility, the possible use of more defined territories, and
regular exploitation of localized food resources (Perttula 2004).

2.2.3 Woodland/Early Ceramic Period
The Woodland period (ca. 200 BC–AD 800) is not well defined but is largely identified by
Gary projectile points and by plainware ceramics tempered with clay/grog or bone. At sites
near the Red River, artifact assemblages are largely made up of ceramics, while at other sites in
Northeast Texas, such as near the Sulphur and Sabine rivers, ceramics are not as common. One
explanation for this difference may be possible regional differences in food processing and
diet during this time, all of which may have had an effect on the degree of sedentism between
regions (Perttula 2004).
To date, archeological evidence suggests Woodland populations were hunters and gatherers
who lived in larger groups and settled for longer periods of time in certain locations than they
had in the Archaic period. In some cases, such as at the Ray site (41LR135), small settlements
with structures and middens suggest a more concentrated occupation, but these sites are not
as permanent as those seen at later Caddo-period sites in the region (Perttula 2004). With the
exception of those in the Sulphur and Neches-Angelina river basins, Woodland sites are not
very common throughout much of Northeast Texas. No Woodland-period burial mounds have
been documented in the region.

2.2.4 Formative Caddo Period and Early Caddo Period
Sites dating to the Formative Caddo period (ca. AD 800–1000) and Early Caddo period
(ca. AD 1000–1200) are located primarily in the uplands just adjacent to major streams and
smaller tributaries and springs. Settlement locations with fertile soils and good drainage were
primarily chosen for habitation and cultivation of maize, squash, and native plants. Permanent
settlements including structures, middens, pits, cemeteries, and artifacts such as tools and
ceramics were widespread. Common settlements in the region include hamlets and farmsteads
with rectangular and circular structures, many with associated cemeteries. In addition to small
farmsteads, larger communities such as the George C. Davis site on the Neches River are also
encountered. These villages are more common during the Early Caddo period and continue
through the Middle Caddo period, and include large groups of many structures, mound
centers, and elite burial pits. Distinctive artifacts such as celts, ceramic pipes and earspools,
and diversely decorated ceramic bowls and jars are commonly recovered from Formative and
Early Caddo sites (Perttula 2004).

2.2.5 Middle Caddo Period
Most archeological sites in Northeast Texas date to the Middle Caddo period (ca. AD 1200–
1400). These sites continue the trend of diverse ceramic artifacts and larger settlements with
mounds seen at the end of the Early Caddo period. One example of such a site is the Oak Hill
Village (41RK214), a large village with mounds, middens, and public structures. Cultivation of
maize and squash continued, but there is no evidence of dependence on maize and other crops
until after AD 1300 (Perttula 2004).

Archeological sites that date to the Late Caddo period (ca. AD 1400–1680) are abundant in
Northeast Texas. Late Caddo sites are predominantly found in river basins such as the Red,
Cypress Creek, and Neches River basins. Smaller groups of sites are present in the Angelina,
Attoyac, middle and upper Sabine, and lower Cypress Bayou basins. Most Late Caddo-period
archeological sites are either large permanent communities or smaller farmsteads, both with
associated cemeteries. Late Caddo-period earthen mounds were constructed and primarily used
between AD 1400 and 1540, except in the Red River, where mound construction continued
until 1650 or 1700 (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993). Stable isotope and bioarcheological evidence
from the region indicate that at this time Caddo peoples were heavily dependent on maize as
their main dietary staple.
The Late Caddo Titus phase (ca. AD 1430–1680) refers to the archeological remains of Caddo
peoples living in the northeastern Texas Piney Woods between the Sulphur and Sabine rivers.
These Caddos lived in a hierarchical and elite-controlled society. They constructed both
small settlements with family cemeteries and large settlements with status-ranked community
cemeteries, and made culturally distinct and diverse ceramics. Titus-phase sites usually are
found on valley terraces and upland slopes, projections, and basins, and permanent settlements
are usually located near freshwater springs (Perttula 2004).
The period after which European contact occurred (ca. AD 1540) is commonly referred to as
the Protohistoric period. In 1542, the De Soto-Moscoso entrada entered the region from the
Mississippi River valley and a number of different Caddo groups were probably encountered
by Spanish explorers. Within 100 to 150 years after the entrada, the area occupied by the
Titus-phase Caddo was mostly abandoned (Perttula 2004). While the archeological evidence
of Caddo-Spanish contact is sparse in Northeast Texas, intermittent contact probably had
considerable effects on Caddo groups, including exposure to a variety of infectious diseases
like smallpox to which they had no immunity (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993).

2.2.7 Historic Period
Historic Caddo Period
The Historic Caddo period (ca. AD 1680–1860) is defined as the sustained European presence
in and occupation of the Caddo area by Europeans in the region. It is during this period that
the Caddo and all other Native American groups except the Alabama and Coushatta were
eventually moved from Texas to the Indian Territory. Most Historic Caddo settlements in the
region were small farmsteads and hamlets with associated household cemeteries. Communities
were composed of many of these farmsteads spread out over large territories. Artifacts
recovered from these sites include a wide variety of Caddo ceramics, basketry, ornaments,
and bone, stone, and wooden tools. European goods are commonly found on Historic Caddo
sites after ca. AD 1740 and include guns and gun parts, glass beads, and metal items such as
kettles; hatchets; knives; hoes; lead balls; and silver, brass, and copper ornaments (Kenmotsu
and Perttula 1993).

European Exploration and Historic Periods
The first likely European expedition into the area around Wright Patman Lake was led by Luis
de Moscoso Alvarado in 1542. Moscoso was a member of the Hernando de Soto expedition
into the southeastern US and took over after de Soto died in 1539. Looking for an overland
route back to New Spain, he crossed into the territory that became Bowie County, and used
existing trails established by the Caddo to move further into the interior of Texas before turning
around and traveling back to the coast (Bruseth and Kenmotsu 1993). French visitors to the
area included Henri Jountel, who was part of the LaSalle expedition, and Henri de Tonti, who
went to the area to look for survivors from Fort St. Louis (Harper 2002b). Permanent European
presence began in 1719, when Le Poste des Cadodaquious was established by the French at a
location just to the northwest of Texarkana. Although a fort in name, the establishment served
more as a trading station and supply base for further expeditions. The fort was abandoned a
few years after the Louisiana cession to Spain in 1762. The fort was reestablished in 1770 by
the Spanish, under the name San Luiz de los Cadodachos, but the Nasoni tribes with whom
they were trying to foster a relationship left the area soon after (Britton 2002). Finally, the
Americans explored the area in 1806 when the Red River Expedition, launched by Thomas
Jefferson, traveled up the Red River to Spanish Bluff, where they were forced to turn back by
Spanish soldiers.
Immigration and settlement of the areas that would become Bowie and Cass Counties began
in the 1820s and 1830s. Both Anglo-Americans and members of the Shawnee, Delaware, and
Kickapoo Indians settled there, but the Native American tribes moved on within ten years.
By 1846, the establishment of separate counties had been made and county lines had been
resolved. The white settlers were primarily from the South and set up slave-operated cotton
plantations as well as raised corn, hogs, and some cattle. Just before the Civil War, the slave
population outnumbered the white population in Bowie County, and numbered just under half
in Cass County (Harper 2002a; Harper 2002b). The white population strongly supported the
secession movement and the Confederate war effort. Although no battle took place in the area,
federal troops occupied Bowie County in 1867 on behalf of the Freedmen’s Bureau to assist
black residents in obtaining their legal and political equality. This enflamed white residents,
who had lost much of their capital once the slaves were freed, and secretly supported anti-black
movements such as Cullen Baker’s gang and the Ku Klux Klan.
By the 1870s, the Texas and Pacific Railway was being built and several towns sprouted up
in the area. Texarkana was founded in 1873, at the site of an abandoned Caddo village, where
two major railroads would soon meet (Chandler and Howe 1939). It immediately became the
largest trading and manufacturing center in the area. Maud was formed in 1870. Atlanta was
founded in 1871, and it, along with Douglassville, was an economic center for the surrounding
rural community (Hazlewood 2002; Harper 2002c).
The entire area remained primarily rural with an agricultural economy, but small manufacturing
also employed some of the local population. The Depression had a devastating effect on the
area, but World War II brought the establishment of the Red River Army Depot and the Lone
Star Army Ammunition Plant, which increasingly employed many of the local residents from
that point forward (Harper 2002a). Changes in the economic market drew many people away

from farming and into manufacturing and trade. However, populations grew slowly, if at all,
and the inhabitants remained relatively poor. Wright Patman Lake was completed in 1957 and
provided recreation facilities as well as flood control measures.

Methods
The archeological field inventory was conducted in one field session from August 25–30, 2011,
by a crew of four persons. Twenty-four person-days were spent in the field. Methods and
density of shovel testing complied with, or exceeded, the minimum requirements for field
tactics stipulated by the USACE (2007).
For each parcel, a logistical plan was prepared in advance using ArcGIS to determine the
minimum number of shovel tests per transect needed to obtain the coverage goal. Each field
archeologist was given a copy of both aerial and USGS topographic views of the parcel
and was assigned a transect line and a targeted number of shovel tests. Transect lines were
designated with an alpha-numeric prefix, and individual shovel tests along each transect line
were numbered so that shovel test “7E-4” identified the fourth test along the seventh transect
of the fifth day of the project. In general, each crew member followed his/her own transect,
walking parallel with the other crew members. Occasionally, for logistical reasons, two crew
members doubled up with one person digging the shovel tests and another screening and
recording the field forms, or two or more surveyors would “leapfrog” along one transect, each
digging alternating shovel tests. Surveyors were given flexibility to place their shovel tests in
likely locations such as topographic rises, rather than at set intervals.
Recent debris such
as aluminum cans,
beer bottles and
plastic detritus was
commonly observed
(Figure 3-1), but no
further attention was
paid to such items
clearly less than 50
years old.

15

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 501 Acres at Wright Patman Lake, Texas

The crew referred both to the site’s plot on the USGS topographic maps at TARL, and also to
the original site sketch map on file at TARL. Allowing for possible map plotting errors, these
sources suggested two possible locations for the site. At both of suspected locations, the crew
conducted a pedestrian inspection of the vicinity and dug multiple shovel tests.
At all shovel tests, GPS readings were taken to verify transect and shovel test locations. Tests
were selectively placed on landforms shown by previous research to be preferred site locations,
such as ridge lines, knolls, and promontories. In some cases, shovel tests could not be dug due
to erosion or steep slopes; these locations were individually recorded on the shovel testing log.
Positive shovel tests were flagged with orange-glo flagging tape while negative shovel tests
were flagged with pink-glo tape.
All shovel tests were 30–35 cm in diameter and were dug to the bottom of the Holocene
deposits as indicated by clay, or to 80 cmbs if no clay was present. Tests were individually
recorded with regard to depth, soil type and color, and cultural material present. Tests were dug
in natural stratigraphic levels not exceeding 20 cm in thickness, and all excavated material was
screened through ¼-inch (6.4 mm) stainless steel mesh. All cultural material was collected
with the exception of recent objects such as bottle glass shards, nails, and aluminum pop-tabs.
These were assumed to indicate recent disturbance and were not collected. All shovel tests
were backfilled.
Each positive shovel test was further investigated by excavating additional shovel tests in
the immediate vicinity at 5–15 m distances up to seven tests in an area. If more than one of
these tests were positive or if more than two artifacts were found in any single test, then the
location was designated as a site. Otherwise, the positive test was designated as an isolated
occurrence. The coordinates of isolates were plotted and the artifacts were collected, but these
were not further recorded. The recorded locations of previously recorded sites were similarly
investigated using multiple shovel tests.

3.1	Stratification of the Project Area
In an effort to focus shovel testing on areas which previous work has suggested to have a greater
probability of containing buried sites, the project area was stratified into two zones on the basis
of topographic features and proximity to water, as evidenced on the USGS 7.5’ topographic
quadrangles. Zone A was delineated to include knolls, ridges and other high landforms in
proximity to naturally occurring water. This zone contained 99 acres including 16 acres (7.6%)
within the Anderson Creek parcel and 83 acres (28.5%) within the Corley parcel (Table 3-1).
Zone B consisted of the remaining 402 acres including 194 acres within the Anderson Creek
parcel and 208 acres within the Corley parcel. Distribution of the two sampling strata is
depicted in Appendix A.

However, within the 99 acres “high probability” delineated as Zone A, a higher rate of shovel
testing was attempted. Within Zone A, 107 shovel tests were excavated including 20 in the
Anderson Creek parcel and 87 in the Corley parcel (Table 3-2). Rate of testing coverage in
Zone A was thus 1.25 tests per acre within the Anderson Creek parcel and 1.05 tests per acre
within the Corley parcel. Net rate of testing within Zone A was 1.08 tests per acre.
In sum, 287 shovel tests were excavated while on transect, or nearly sixty percent more than
the contractual minimum. The Anderson Creek parcel was tested at a net density of 0.53
shovel tests per acres, with the high probability areas at a rate of 1.25 shovel tests per acre. The
Corley parcel was tested at a net rate of 0.60 shovel tests per acre with the high probability
areas at a rate of 1.05 shovel tests per acre. Appendix A provides maps of all transect shovel
test and high probability area locations by parcel, and the data from all 287 shovel tests are
presented in Appendix B.

3.3 	Evaluation of Significance
The NHPA of 1966, as amended, [16 USC 470 et seq.] created the NRHP to preserve and
protect important aspects of our nation’s cultural heritage. Among other actions, the Act directs
federal agencies to assume responsibility for the preservation of historic properties located
on their land or controlled by them, and further stipulates that such agencies must take into
account the effects of their actions on cultural resources. Pursuant to this direction, agencies
Ecological Communications Corporation

17

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 501 Acres at Wright Patman Lake, Texas

are required to locate, inventory, and nominate to the Secretary of the Interior all properties
owned or under their control that appear to qualify for nomination to the NRHP. Eligibility for
nomination to the NRHP is restricted to properties that are significant and possess integrity as
defined in 36 CFR §60.4:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering and
culture is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of
location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association (36 CFR §60.4).
Significance is further defined in four criteria. Cultural resources are considered significant if:
a) they are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history; or
b) they are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
c) they embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period or method
of construction, or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high
artistic values, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose
component may lack individual distinction; or
d) they have yielded, or may be likely to yield information important in prehistory
or history (36 CFR §60.4).
Cultural resources may qualify for inclusion on the NRHP under any of the four evaluation
criteria. Methods developed prior to the current field work specified that prehistoric sites were
to be evaluated for significance with respect to NHPA Criterion D. The demonstrated data
content of each site was to be compared to important research contexts. Sites in good condition
and state of preservation and having several data types bearing on one or more of the research
contexts were to be evaluated as significant under Criterion D. Those sites that were observed
to be in poor condition or state of preservation and/or sites with no data types bearing on one
or more of the research contexts were to be evaluated as not significant. Finally, sites whose
expression could not be satisfactorily investigated using the survey level tactics employed by
this study were to be classified as being of unknown significance.
Historic sites, in addition to being evaluated under Criterion D as described above, were also
to be evaluated with respect to Criteria A, B, and C. Archival research was to be conducted to
determine whether any historic sites are associated with important historical events or persons.
Criterion C was to be applied only for historic sites that retain architectural elements.

Results
Two parcels totaling 501 acres were investigated at Wright Patman Lake. Within the two parcels
no new archeological sites were discovered and the location of one previously recorded site
was investigated. In addition, three isolated occurrences were encountered and investigated.

4.1

Anderson Creek

The Anderson Creek parcel totaled 210 acres and was inventoried using 112 shovel tests,
for a density of 0.53 shovel tests per acre. No new cultural resource sites were documented.
However two isolated occurrences were present and a non-site area of interest was observed
near the northern end of the parcel. Appendices A and B plot the locations and results of all
shovel tests excavated within the Anderson Creek parcel.

4.1.1 Isolated Occurrences
Both isolated occurrences were located on hilltops and were about 300 meters from each other.
Each isolate consisted of one flake found in the 20–40 cmbs range. At each location, five
additional shovel tests were excavated on the same landform and nearby landforms in order
to determine if a site was present. Other than the initial positive test at each location, all
additional shovel tests were negative.

4.1.2 Area of Interest
In the northern portion of the parcel, north of the railroad, is an area of potential interest. This
area included a berm from an abandoned rail spur (Figure 4-1) and an alignment of household
items and fragmented asphalt which have been discarded in the recent past (Figure 4-2). The
debris in the area consists of recent debris including car fenders, household appliances such as
stoves, clothes dryers, a large industrial fan, and glass and plastic bottles and containers. None
of the artifacts appeared to be older than 50 years. The asphalt was broken into pieces ranging
from 0.6 to 1.5 m (2 to 5 ft) across and likely originates from the old alignment of Highway
67 before the current bridge over Anderson Creek was built. The old road may have been
bulldozed to stop the dumping of trash. This recent dumping area was not recorded as a site.

4.2 	Corley
The Corley parcel totaled 291 acres and was inventoried using 175 shovel tests, for a net density
of 0.60 shovel tests per acre. No new cultural resource sites were documented. Previously
recorded site 41BW27 was investigated; the tactics used to locate previously recorded sites are
presented in Section 3.1. In addition, one isolated occurrence was investigated. See Appendices

Survey conducted before Wright Patman
Lake (then Texarkana Reservoir) was

Stephenson and Taylor’s (1949b) original
site form. The site was recorded as
being on the “edge of small ridge [with]
occupational evidence washing out”
(Stephenson and Taylor 1949b). They
go on to say that there are few sherds
and lithics washing out and that the site
is most likely shallow (Stephenson and
Taylor 1949b).
The site is described in the online site
form as being on the east side of Panther
Creek, in a pasture 300 to 400 yards
to the west of the woods (Stephenson
and Taylor 1949b). The area has been
overgrown with pine trees since the
initial visit to the site in 1949 so no
distance measurement could be used to
find the exact location of the site. The
THC Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
has 41BW27 plotted on the edge of a
small ridge extending from a large flat

area toward Panther Creek as it is turning from its north—south run to an east—west run to the
creek’s confluence with Anderson Creek (THC 2011). The sketch site plan, though schematic
at best, shows the site at the confluence of Panther Creek and another creek or stream. If this
map is to be taken as accurate, a landform that fits this description is located 450 m northnorth-east (still within parcel) of the THC location at the junction of Moss Creek flowing into
Panther Creek. Stephenson and Taylor’s (1949b) site form makes no mention of a second
creek in the location data which they provided.
The THC Atlas depicts the site location using a centroid marker only—no site boundaries are
indicated. EComm archeologists inspected this location on record and observed no surface
artifacts. In addition to pedestrian survey, seven shovel tests were excavated in this location
specifically to locate the site, with two more on-transect shovel tests also in the area. The area
is a well terraced slope with shovel tests 1–4 on the top of the ridge, shovel tests 7 and 14A-3
on the middle terrace, and shovel tests 5 and 6 excavated on the lowest terrace below the
cutbank of Panther Creek. Shovel test 15A-3 was excavated at the bottom of an un-terraced
slope to the west. All shovel tests
in the area were negative with no
cultural materials present. The
parcel boundary limited the ability
to check to the south of the marked
site and slopes to the northwest were
also not conducive to shovel testing.
The soil in the area is shallow with
clay between 5 and 40 cmbs; most
shovel tests encountered clay at
30 cmbs. Figure 4-3 depicts this
location, showing shovel tests and
the site centroid as plotted on the
THC Atlas. No site boundaries are
shown as these are unknown.

EComm archeologists also inspected
a second location about 450 m
northeast of the plotted location of
41BW27. This second location is
near the confluence of Panther and
Moss creeks and better matches the
site plan included in Stephenson and
Taylor’s 1949(b) site form. Portions
of this location have been heavily
impacted by construction of a road
and parking lot. Six shovel tests
were excavated in undisturbed areas
on and around this ridge between
the two creeks, all of which returned
21

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 501 Acres at Wright Patman Lake, Texas

negative results. The three shovel tests excavated on the ridge (1A-2, 2A-1, and 3A-1) all
encountered clay at 30 cmbs, while the two (18E-1 and 18E-2) excavated further up the ridge
encountered clay at 10 cmbs. The shovel test that was just off the ridge (4A-1), closer to the
creeks, encountered mottled clay at 50 cmbs. A view of the ridge top can be seen in Figure 4-4.
In sum, 15 shovel tests
were excavated at the two
possible locations to find
41BW27. All 15 shovel
tests were negative. This
site was recorded in
1949 as a small number
of artifacts washing out
of the side of a ridge at
what was thought to be
at the high water mark of
Wright Patman Lake. It

site has eroded away

4.2.2 Isolated Occurrence
Within the Corley parcel, two primary flakes were recovered from Shovel Test 4E-1. Surrounding
this positive test, five additional shovel tests were excavated. All of the five additional shovel
tests were negative for cultural materials. All shovel tests in the area were shallow with clay
at or above 20 cmbs.

Conclusions
5.1 	Summary of Work
This cultural resources inventory investigated two parcels near Wright Patman Lake in Bowie
County, East Texas. The sample consisted of 501 total acres including 210 acres within the
Anderson Creek parcel and 291 acres within the Corley parcel. Field methods included a
pedestrian survey accompanied by excavation of 287 shovel tests. Tests were approximately
30 cm in diameter and were dug to either the clay horizon or to 80 cmbs. Shovel testing density
for tests excavated during the survey was 0.57 tests per acre.

Of the 287 shovel tests dug, only three
tests were positive, for an overall yield
of one percent (Table 5-1). All three of
the positive shovel tests were isolated
occurrences that were not associated
with any site. The remaining 284 shovel
tests were negative, including 262
negative tests that were dug on transects
and 22 negative tests that were dug off
transect around isolated positive shovel
tests (n=15) or off transect in search of a
previously recorded site (n=7).
The inventory investigated one
previously recorded archeological site,
41BW27. The location of this site
could not be confirmed despite multiple
shovel testing in two different possible
locations of the site.

5.2 	Management Recommendations
The eligibility of any given archeological site for nomination to the NRHP is determined by
evaluating the site’s significance, or its potential to contribute meaningfully to future scientific
research. Research potential is assessed by comparing the types of data that are known—or are
suspected—to exist at the site, together with their provenience, context, and integrity, against
a set of research questions that have been previously recognized for similar sites in the region.
Ecological Communications Corporation

23

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 501 Acres at Wright Patman Lake, Texas

For the current project, these research questions are discussed in the planning document for
East Texas (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993).
At previously recorded archeological site 41BW27, 15 shovel tests were excavated in two
possible alternative locations for the site; no cultural resources were observed nor recovered
at either location. The site was recorded in 1949 and was described at that time as washing
out from the side of a ridge. It is not known whether 1) the site was accurately plotted but
has since been destroyed by erosion, or 2) the site was mis-plotted and its true location is not
known. As a result, the NRHP eligibility status of the site is uncertain and no further work is
recommended at this location.
