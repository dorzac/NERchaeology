Time to Meet Joe Rogers
2010 TAS President
I came into archeology and this Society almost by accident, though I had been on the edges of this discipline
for a long time. I had attended a few workshops, gathered
some old stuff, and read some archeological articles. I even
did what I later learned to be historical archeology while
studying the Italian POW camp in Hereford.
During one of our visits, TAS member Judge Wesley Gulley of Hereford encouraged me to attend Field School as he
explained this or that aspect of the discipline. Events would
fall into place for me to throw a small tent, a back pack and a
cooler into the back of a Buick Park Avenue just in time for
me to go to Marfa for the 2000 TAS Field School. Now if you
were there, you might be wondering why I am here.
It was the people. I was assigned to a survey crew with
Jim Warren and recorded rock shelters all week. I learned
more history in that week than in the past decade. Dan Potter helped me hold a make-shift shade together, Art Tawater
explained the area’s culture and complexity, Bill and Jean Parnell helped me refloat my tent to higher ground and explained
some of the intricacies of the Society… . I was hooked. I took
the advice of Pat Mercado-Allinger and went home and joined
the local Panhandle Archeological Society. There I met Alvin
Lynn; many of you who also have had this pleasure understand his impact on my introduction to archeology.
Then came more Field Schools and time spent with Carol Macaulay, Jimmy Smith, Sonny Wheeler, Andie Comini,
Alan Skinner, Doug Boyd—well, you get the idea. I would
return time and time again to my world of public education
and relay the knowledge and insight that this mix of professionals and avocationals had given me. I know that one is
not supposed to make lists for fear of omitting important
people, so I looked at the official TAS membership roll and
found there are currently 1310 entries. They are all important
to what this Society means to me. The variety of interests

and expertise that come
together officially and
unofficially—around
campsites, through emails and publications,
on websites, in boardrooms, at Academies—
surely, what we do and
what we accomplish is
phenomenal.
It is with a great
anticipation that we
begin a new year in
this Society. In the
process of fulfilling
Joe Rogers
the requirements of
becoming your president, I have been exposed to all of the
various TAS committees and their memberships; it has been
an enlightening experience. The level of commitment that
is spread across the entire Society is an absolute wonder.
The willingness of so many to serve in various capacities
and the high level of expertise that they bring must truly
be unique among organizations. Many folks are willing to
serve repeatedly in areas that require specific knowledge
and continuity, and yet they train new members so that new
ideas and approaches are introduced. Some serve graciously
and then step aside when they find that particular area is
not really a good “fit” for them, or feel that it is just time to
move on to other things. This is a large organization with
a deep tradition of exactness and ethics, and not everyone
always agrees with everything that is done. Even so, it is also
a Society that welcomes dialog, discussion, and sometimes
even compromise.

Continued from page 1

What I find exhilarating is the continual uncompromising search for understanding. I try to explain to my students
that, unlike a CSI episode where they have all this physical
evidence to solve a single crime, this discipline uses a few
lithics, shards, and soil stains to see how an entire society
lived and interacted. It just flat does not get any better than
that.
I realize that we have some challenges to confront, but
I am firmly convinced that this Society has the personnel
reserves to deal with them as they arise. I would be remiss if
I did not mention the previous slate of officers that have so

wonderfully tutored me into this spot—and yes, Grant, I am
very grateful that you were able to “stick around.”
Joe D. Rogers is a recently semi-retired public school
history teacher. He and his wife Cindy reside in Hereford
and have two daughters. He has Bachelor of Occupational
Education degree from Wayland Baptist University and a B.
A. and M. A. in history from West Texas A&M University.
He continues to teach history at WTAMU as a part-time
instructor. Joe has served as President of the Panhandle Archeological Society, TAS Region I director, and as a THC
Steward in the Panhandle since 2002.

Let’s Express Our Thanks Sooner
Than Later!!!!!!!

Burleson was honored at

For the first time in my involvement with the Awards
Committee, we recommended that an award be presented
posthumously. It was not a difficult decision to make
regarding the nominee, since he has been involved in
promoting, directing, and participating in TAS activities
including leading singing at Field School for more years
than I can remember; it was difficult because the committee had to wrestle with why had he not been nominated
before? The answer in my mind is distance and apathy…
. Bear in mind that the committee’s job is not to find or
make award nominations; it is to evaluate the nominations
that are received. Many years were have received one or
two nominations for each award category. In these cases,
we may give one or two awards or we may not believe that
either nominee meets the criteria for the award so we rec-

ommend no award. This year we did not present a nominee
for the Distinguished Service award and had two nominations for the same person for the Francis Stickney Field
School Award. It is our goal to select from the nominations
we receive, those individuals who represent the essence of
the meaning of the award.
Your job as TAS members, if you choose to accept the
job, is to be watchful, to weigh the essence of the award
with regard to the members that you know personally, and
then present to the Committee a nomination for that person
who in your estimation represents the essence of a particular award. The criteria of each award is presented in a short
article contained in the July issue of Texas Archeology,
so the criteria are available in a very timely manner to all
members in the newsletter. The list of previous recipients
is available on the TAS Website under List of Lists so it
is easy to check to determine if your nominee has already
received the award you are thinking about. Nominations
are needed by September 1st of each year because the
Committee needs to make their recommendations to the
Executive Committee at the September Board Meeting.
Nominations normally consist of a nomination letter, which
documents the individual’s accomplishments as they relate
to the award. Frequently, letters of support accompany the
nomination letter or arrive separately in the mail in support

of a nominee. This year we had nominations from two different parts of the state for the same person.
As a Society, we need to grow and a part of that is
recognizing those that have advanced us to the place we
are today and encouraging others to carry forth the banner.
Awards are part of that process and we need to look at our
growth and advancement and recognize it when it is happening not decades later. Therefore, the committee looks
forward to receiving a larger number of nominations in
upcoming years and to being part of the process of thanking those outstanding and hard working individuals for all
their efforts in TAS and Texas Archeology.
This year the Society chose to present the Fellow Award
to Bob Burleson of Temple, the Francis Stickney Field
School Award to Dempsey Malaney of Ochiltree County,
the C.K. Chandler Award to Rose Mary Rogers and Tommy
Garrison, of the Iraan Society, the Golden Pen Award to Laurie Moseley of Springtown, and the Texas Biface Historic
Preservation Award to Tommy Garrison of Iraan.
Quoting from the nomination letter for Bob Burleson,
Bob’s membership in the TAS lasted two years
short of a half-century (1961-2009) and his powerful presence was felt by everyone who worked with
him, listened to his folk music, and learned of the
many things he did to protect, preserve, promote,
and enliven the archaeological and natural wonder
of our state. Bob was a lawyer by profession, a
conservationist by heart, and he masterfully used
his professional acumen in promoting his passion
for conservation.

Bob’s award was accepted on his behalf by State Archeologist, Pat Mercado-Allinger, and was presented to his
wife Mickey at the Burleson Ranch on November the 10.
The Francis Stickney Field School award was awarded
to Dempsey Malaney and was received for him by Bob
Smith, his field school camp boss trainer. In his two years
as CO-Camp Boss and then Camp Boss, Dempsey exemplified the spirit of this award as he committed to seeing
that the camp operations ran smoothly despite rains, hail
and tornados.
In the spirit of recording sites year in and year out, the
C.K. Chandler Award was presented to Tommy Garrison

and Rose Mary Rogers of the Iraan Archeological Society.
In all, they recorded 37 sites all of which were submitted
handwritten and required typing by Jonathan Jarvis at the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory.
Writing articles for local newspapers is a task that has
been accepted by numerous members of the years and is
still being pursued by several TAS members throughout
the state. Laurie Moseley of Springtown writes a weekly
column for the Springtown Epigraph and has been doing
this for over fifteen years. These columns go into a book
sold at the Legend’s Museum in Springtown. He has also
written a newsletter for the Optimist Club and was editor
of the Somerville County Centennial History, which is now
in its fifth printing. The Golden Pen award was proudly
earned by Laurie Moseley.
The Texas Biface Historic Preservation Award was
presented to Tommy Garrison of the Iraan Archeological
Society. Garrison has recorded and documented a variety
of historic and prehistoric resources in his home territory.
These include a prehistoric rock shelter, getting a THC
marker for “Giddings Lost Pecos Station of the Lower
Road in Pecos County, and two unmarked graves near
the Pecos Station just to mention a few things. Now the
Awards Committee is looking forward to receiving numerous nominations from you, the membership, for the
Awards of 2010.

Coming Full Circle
I was approached recently to write a brief testimonial on
the subject of the Texas Archeological Society Academies.
More specifically, my participation in the Lithics Academy
held nearly two years ago in January 2008. “Lithics: Reading
Stone Artifacts” was one of several archeology programs in
a classroom setting developed by Dr. Harry Shafer for TAS.
I was delighted to learn from Lynn Yakubik that the Lithics
course was being brought back for 2010. Of course I was more
than happy to write “a little something” about what I gained
by registering and attending two TAS Academies. After all,
the Lithics course really did blow me away and was just a hint
of what was to come. Taught by Dr. Harry Shafer, it exceeded
my expectations and I took away from that class a greater
understanding of what flaked stone or debitage really tells us.
Dr. Shafer did say, and I’m paraphrasing here, ‘……by the end
of this academy you will never look at a chert flake the same
way again… ‘ and you know….he was right. So this is really a
heartfelt personal recommendation in support of and to serve
as a token of my appreciation for the folks at TAS.
As I reflected carefully on my experiences during the past
two years since attending my first TAS Academy, the simplicity
of my statement below does not really explain why something
as ordinary as registering and attending a class could have such
a positive effect on someone’s life. Your experience will be
different from mine, but you can rely on the fact that TAS has
a mission to educate all Texans. This is accomplished through
public outreach and educational programs such as these TAS
Academies, archeological related activities and field schools.
Academies offer the public incredible archeological classroom
and hands-on opportunities. These are available to anyone who
has an interest in Texas history, prehistory, geology, and archeology regardless of age, education or background. The TAS
offers a variety of choices ranging from ceramics to understanding rock art to reading flaked stone materials. These classes are
not only affordable but are a worthy personal investment as
well. In all fairness, and to relieve some of the pressure on good
folks at TAS, I will say that I am no different than most people
and of course the experience will vary from person to person.
Now what? Do something for yourself today, register for
an academy, become a member of TAS, get involved locally,
visit your local museums. Get to know your regional stewards
and do your part to help conserve, educate and protect Texas
archeology. Did you know that Texas has some of the most
important archeological sites in North America if not the world?
It’s all right here in your backyard and TAS provides a way for
you to learn from the best and brightest in Texas and around

Nancy works the screens at the Gault Site.

the globe. Finally, I must add that the food was fantastic. This
should be the clincher for your final decision.
The TAS Academies were a life-changing experience and was one of the best investments I’ve ever made
in myself. The Lithics Academy not only met, but exceeded my expectations and was a perfect complement to
Archeology 101 Academy and I am so glad that you are
offering it again. And while I have “come full circle,” or
back to my humble beginnings, so to speak, it is my greatest pleasure to give you this heartfelt testimonial. Thank
you TAS for the opportunities your academies provided,
to learn about Texas archaeology, for helping me fulfill a
life-long wish and to realize that dreams can come true.
While my journey has been wondrous, it is far from over.

I would like to dedicate this article/testimonial to the
memory of my dear friend Sam Gardner. He was the first Gault
Staffer I met at the Gault Site while participating in Archeology101 in early February of 2008. A true friend, a gentle giant,
talented artist and photographer, his wry sense of humor, his
quirky smile and his archaeology “wisdomisms” had a profound effect on my life and left an indelible mark in my heart.
I will always miss him

2010 TAS Field School in Medina County, Texas
Thomas R. Hester, Principal Investigator

This is a brief introduction to the archaeological program for the 2010 TAS Field School. It will be held in
northern Medina County, between Hondo and the suburbs
of Tarpley, west of FM 462. This is in the Hill Country,
roughly 48 miles west-northwest of San Antonio. Glynn
Osburn and the TAS Field School Committee have obtained
a great camping facility just north of Hondo and have the
enthusiastic support of city and county officials in the area.
The major site to be studied is 41ME147 (the Calvert
Site), a multi-component site with terrace deposits perhaps
5 meters thick. This locale is literally along at the southern
edge of the Edwards Plateau; the site itself sits atop a high
bluff overlooking Hondo Creek. Just downstream is Eagle
Bluff, an impressive limestone exposure and local landmark.
We already have some data on the nature and significance
of the site. Some comes from untrained digging for artifacts
carried out there over a number of years. Surprisingly, this
activity has damaged a comparatively limited portion of
the site. The collector has shared his information with us,
and the documentation of this large collection (back in the
laboratory at Hondo City Park) is one of our several goals.
A preliminary review of his artifacts indicates intensive
Middle Archaic occupations (Pedernales, Kinney, Langtry)
as well as Late Archaic (Castroville, Ensor, Frio; large thin
bifaces) and Late Prehistoric. Arrow points, including Scallorn and Perdiz were found, along with a fingernail-punctated
potsherd. This specimen is likely from a wide-mouthed jar
made by the Caddo (Harry Shafer, personal communication).
In 2006-2007, the Southern Texas Archaeological Association (STAA) carried out exploratory investigations at
the site. This ranged from brush clearing and TDS mapping
to the excavation of a large, well-preserved hearth at 3.5
meters below the surface, one of several exposed in the
face of the terrace. Found near that hearth was an Early
Archaic stemmed point, perhaps of the Gower type. The
huge back dirt pile left by the collector’s digging was partially screened, and indicates that the non-scientific digging
missed a lot of valuable information.
Recently, the landowner built a house on the edge of the
site, doubtless thinking he was well beyond its boundaries!
However, a small trench for utilities exposed a substantial
Toyah occupation, about a foot thick, with Perdiz points and
well-preserved bison bones.

he also recorded several other sites on the ranch. TAS survey

crews will finish this survey and move on to record sites on
an adjacent ranch and perhaps other areas as well.
In short, this major prehistoric site provides the first
opportunity to look at the cultural patterns of this part of the
Edwards Plateau using excavated materials that are buried,
some of them very deeply, in excellent contexts. Those TAS
members who “worry” about having to dig in a “burned rock
midden” need not fear, as the fire-cracked rock at this site
are either scattered or in cooking features! These features
extend back in time to at least the Early Archaic. A number are exposed in the terrace bluff. The function of these
features will be explored. Bone preservation is very good
in some parts of the site. Trade items from the Texas coast
and from the Caddo area offer a chance to get new data on
exchange systems in the area. I could go on for a very long
time discussing the multitude of issues and questions that
can be addressed by scientific excavations at the Calvert
Site. However, I will inflict these on the readers in later and
longer updates about the TAS field school in 2010.
While the prehistoric archeology will be focused on the
Calvert site on Hondo Creek, a Historic site in downtown
Castroville (about 15 miles from the TAS camp) will be
investigated. The site is in a courtyard partly surrounded
by 1840s-50s stone buildings. One of these houses is a
restaurant, and when the new owner went to dig a pit, in
June 2009, next to an old smokehouse, a great quantity of

artifacts were uncovered. These are dominated by 1850searly 1860s military materials, such as rusted clumps of
US-stamped mule shoes, a distinctive military belt buckle,
ginger beer bottles, medicine bottles, bluing bottles, wine
bottle fragments in profusion, ceramics, bone and other
remains. At first glance, it appears to be a trash pit of some
sort. It may well represent the period of the surrender of
the Union garrison (a company of the U.S. 8th Infantry) in
Castroville during 1861. The excavations will be structured
to better understand this feature. What is this deposit? How
far does it extend? Can it be more precisely dated and the

range of artifact functions be determined? The TAS field
crew investigating this site will have the enthusiastic support of the restaurant owners and the neighborhood. Lynn
Yakubik will head up the work.
So there you have it: a hill country setting, camping
under oak trees in a city park, a barn for camp gatherings and
shelter from inclement weather, a rich, multi-component site
on Hondo Creek, no fear of burned rock middens, a historic
site in old Castroville, documentation of a large private collection, survey on the Calvert Site ranch and surrounding
area all weigh in to make 2010 a not-to-miss Field School!

Medina County, Here We Come!
Glynn Osburn, Chair, Field School Committee

This year’s TAS Field School will be located in Medina
County, about 18 miles from the city of Hondo. It promises to
be an outstanding Field School with some great archeology
for everyone. We will have prehistoric archeology 16 miles
from our campground at the Calvert Site (also known as
Eagle Bluff), historic archeology in nearby Castroville, site
testing about 30 miles away near Bandera Falls, and we are
working on locations for survey. Dr. Thomas R. Hester will
serve as Principal Investigator of this Field School.
The city of Hondo is extending a warm welcome and
is looking forward to accommodating us. The Field School
will be in a great location for many of us in Texas. Hondo
is only about 40 miles west of San Antonio and our campground is just north of downtown. Here we will be found at
the Medina County Fairground, and we’ll have the use of
the large livestock barn for our programs, meals and leisure.
We will also have the use of the adjacent city park with large
live oak trees for shade. There is a playground for kids at
the park, too.
Highway 90 goes through Hondo and is where most of
the motels, restaurants, fast food places and grocery stores
are located. For lodging, there is a new Best Western, 830426-4466, an Executive Inn, 830-426-2535, and an America’s Best Value Inn, 830-426-3031. There are also several
RV parks in Hondo that, along with other businesses can be
found at the Hondo Chamber of Commerce website, http://
hondochamber.com Click on the membership directory on
the right menu, then choose the category of business you
are looking for.
More information about Hondo attractions and details
about the Field School with a map to the campground will
be forthcoming in your April TAS newsletter.

Education Committee to Increase
Outreach to Teachers
The Education Committee is expanding outreach
to Texas teachers and scout groups. We plan to hold
workshops for teachers in five selected school districts.
The workshops will include “hands on” activities,
sample lesson plans, high interest handouts, and introducing various aspects of archeology such as rock
art and paleo-technology.
The workshops may also include flint knapping,
friction fire, mock excavation, science, math, archeoastronomy, artifact identification, and archeological ethics. A Gifted and Talented component will be included.
The Education Committee has applied for a grant
to help with our goal of increasing archeological
awareness among Texas teachers and students. “We
are very hopeful that the grant will materialize so that
our outreach plan will be successful,” stated Robin

Test Excavations at the Archie King II
A Middle Ceramic Period Homestead in Roberts County, Texas
Scott D. Brosowske
In June 2009 the annual Texas Archaeological Society
field school was held outside of Perryton, Texas. During the
course of the field school excavations were conducted at seven
different sites along three south flowing tributaries to the Canadian River. The scale of investigations at these sites varied
and included small to large open block excavations at Chill
Hill (41RB132), Evan’s Military Supply Depot (41RB110),
Cross L (41RB140), and Archie King I (41RB118). Test Excavations were also conducted at three ceramic period homestead sites. These sites included Archie King II (41RB121),
Killer (41RB152), and Eastview (41RB153). This article will
discuss the preliminary results from the work completed at
the Archie King II site.
The Archie King II site is one of several Antelope Creek
phase homesteads distributed along Couch Creek and its
tributaries. First described by Warren K. Moorehead in Archaeology of the Arkansas River Valley in 1931, these sites
are situated on prominent valley knolls and are characterized
by the presence of one to five habitation structures outlined
with locally available caliche cobbles.
The topography at the Archie King II site includes an
eroded, low north to south trending ridge along the western
margins of the site and a flat, sandy terrace along an unnamed
tributary to Couch Creek on the northeastern side of the site
(Figure 1). Previous investigations at this site have focused on

the documentation of a single habitation structure, two stone
cairns, and a midden feature atop the north to south ridge.
Recently two trash filled features containing faunal
remains, ceramics, chipped stone, charcoal, and burned and
fire cracked rock were exposed along the margins of the dry
tributary that borders the northeastern margin of the site. Subsequent surveys of the adjoining terrace to the west identified
only sparse cultural remains exposed in a deeply rutted two
track road that runs across the eastern side of the site. When
the site was recorded in 2004 site boundaries were drawn to
include the features exposed along the tributary. However,
considering the distance between these features and the architectural features along the ridge top (approximately 180
meters) and the apparent lack of cultural remains between
the two areas, it was not known whether the two site areas
were occupied contemporaneously or if they represented
separate components.
Initially, the goal of the 2009 fieldwork at Archie King
II was to salvage the cultural features exposed along the dry
tributary. However, given that the location of the terrace was
to the leeward or northeast of the nearby ridge top, it was
thought that intact cultural features might be present within
the terrace fill, but were buried by aeolian and alluvial deposits. If this was the case, it might explain why rodent activity
in this part of the site had not brought cultural materials to
the site surface as is commonly the case
at shallowly buried sites.
To determine if buried cultural
features were indeed present in the
northeastern portions of the site a
geophysical survey was conducted at
the site a week prior to the 2009 field
school. A magnetic survey using a
Geoscan Research FM 256 magnetic
gradiometer was completed by Geoff
Jones of Archaeo-Physics, LLC., Minneapolis, Minnesota. The size of the
area surveyed was 30-by-90 meters
(Figure 1). The results of this survey
identified six subtle magnetic anomalies thought to be cultural in origin.
Of these, an anomaly about 4 meters

southwest of the features exposed along the tributary was
selected for test excavations (Figure 2). This anomaly was
thought to represent a habitation structure, perhaps 3 meters
in diameter, which contained a central hearth.
With the assistance of Geoff Jones, Joan Few, the
principal investigator of the Archie King II site, laid out a oneby-four meter unit centered directly over what was thought
to be the central hearth feature prior to the field school.
Working with a crew of six, including Kellie Clarkson, Agnes
Herschbach, Carol Lynn Klepac, Marcia Ansel, Katie Dennis,
and Randy Humphreys, three to four levels across the entire
unit were completed by the end of the short field school. All
matrix from the site was screened through shaker screens
fitted with 3 mm mesh.
The upper levels of the block contained sparse quantities of cultural materials, but from 24 to 43 cm below ground
surface (bgs) the amount of trash debris increased dramatically. Cultural materials recovered included chipped stone
debitage and tools, burned and unburned faunal remains,
ceramics, daub, mussel shell, fire cracked quartzite boiling
stones, burned caliche, and a bone awl. By the end of the field

school the bottom of this thin deposit of midden remains was
reached in nearly all areas of the block.
The bottom elevations of the midden indicated that this
deposit was contained within a basin-shaped depression about
3 meters in length. This depression was 30 cm bgs in depth
along the east and west margins and it dipped to a depth of
about 50 cm in the center of the basin. What was unclear at
that time was whether the midden was in a cultural feature
or some type of natural feature, such as a gully. Nonetheless,
at the completion of the field school it was anticipated that
sterile deposits had essentially been reached.
Following the field school Courson Archaeological
Research staff returned to Archie King II to complete what
little excavation we thought remained and to draw and
photograph the unit profiles. Immediately below the midden
we encountered a hard packed sterile surface that we believed
represented the floor of a small habitation structure. With
this being said, we elected to excavate two additional 10 cm
levels into the sterile deposits below the floor. About halfway
into the second level we began to encounter a second, lower
midden deposit similar to the one described above. In the

center of the one-by-four meter unit this layer of midden
debris continued to a maximum depth of 90 cm bgs. In the
central part of the depression we encountered a small, basinshaped hearth containing an abundance of ash and charcoal.
This feature does not appear to have been used very long
as the underlying soil exhibited very little discoloring. We
believe that this surface represents a second, lower floor.
In sum, the results of test excavations at the Archie King
II site documented a shallow basin-shaped habitation structure (Figure 3). Initially, the structure was about 3 meters
in diameter and excavated to a depth of about 60 cm below
the aboriginal ground surface. The limited discoloration of
the soil underlying the small, basin-shaped hearth centrally
located in this structure appears to indicate that this feature
was occupied for a short period of time. Immediately after the
abandonment of this structure, a layer of trash debris about
20 cm thick was deposited on the floor. The sterile, aeolian
material approximately 15 cm thick that overlies this debris
suggests that the site was abandoned for a period of time. At
a later date, the site was reoccupied. The upper, hard packed
floor in this structure appears to indicate that this feature was
reoccupied at this time. Although additional excavation would
be needed, if a second hearth is not associated with this upper
surface it may indicate that this house depression was used
for some other type of activity, perhaps a place to work that
was out of the wind. Similar to the earlier episode, this feature
was again abandoned and trash thrown into the depression.
Currently, we are still in the process of washing, sorting,
and cataloging materials recovered from excavations completed
following the field school. Nonetheless, a few preliminary observations can be made. First, cultural materials recovered from
the habitation structure are dominated by bison faunal remains.
Joan Few correctly noted that these remains were indicative of
processing for meat and marrow. Further processing for bone
grease is not represented. All portions of the skeleton are well

represented, including low utility elements, such as vertebra,
crania, and pelves, and suggest that bison hunting was conducted
near the site. While bison elements are most common, remains
of deer or antelope, box turtle, and birds are also present.
Chipped stone debitage and tools were also recovered at
Archie King II. Raw materials represented include Alibates
silicified dolomite, silicified caliche, Dakota quartzite, Smoky
Hill jasper, and obsidian. Of these, Alibates and silicified
caliche are most common and represent about 75% and 21%
of the entire assemblage, respectively. Chipped stone tools
are relatively infrequent, but include Washita and Fresno
projectile points, distal endscrapers, and beveled knives
(Figure 4). Notably, several of the heavily reworked formal

tools recovered from the lower floor of the habitation structure
were manufactured from Smoky Hill jasper.
Ceramics recovered from the site fit well within the
range documented for Borger cordmarked ceramics. Surface treatment of the ceramics from Archie King II includes
cordmarked, partially cordmarked, and smoothed. They are
tempered with fine to medium sands. Thickness of these
sherds varies considerably, from 2.8 mm to 7.2 mm, with
an average of 4.5 mm. The rims are typically undecorated,
although three rim sherds from a single vessel recovered from
the lower floor had folded over lips with circular punctate
impressions (Figure 5).
Surprisingly, despite the limited amount of matrix excavated at the site (i.e., 3.0 m3), a number of bone tools were
recovered from the site. These items included a bison tibia
digging stick, two fragmentary bison scapula tools, and awls
made from bison ribs and deer or antelope metapodials. The
presence of the scapula tools and digging stick appears to
indicate that the occupants of the site had a horticultural
component to their economy. This idea is further supported
by the recovery of corn cobs, cupules, and kernel fragments
in the flotation samples collected from the house fill (Mary
Adair, personal communication).
Interestingly, there are a number of similarities that have
been noted between the Archie King II and Chill Hill sites.

For example, rim sherds identical to those described above
(i.e., folded over lips and with punctate impressions) were
also recovered this summer at Areas A and B at Chill Hill
(41RB132). In addition, the presence of Smoky Hill jasper
at sites along the Canadian River is very unusual. Currently,
this raw material is only well documented at Archie King II,
Chill Hill, and Killer (41RB152). The small basin-shaped
habitation structures documented at Chill Hill also appear to be
represented at Archie King II. Lastly, exotic trade items from
the eastern Pueblos are also well represented at both sites. Five
obsidian flakes and a single Olivella shell bead were recovered
from Archie King II (Figure 6). These similarities are quite
distinctive for the Canadian River valley and may indicate that
these two habitation sites were occupied contemporaneously.
In closing, we at Courson Archaeological Research would
like to thank Joan Few and her entire crew for their excellent
work at the Archie King II site. While only limited excavations
were conducted at this site during the field school, it is clear
that a great deal of information will be gleaned from this work.
The materials recovered from a portion of a single habitation
structure will provide insight into hunting and processing
strategies, the importance of native and domesticated plants,
seasonality and age of occupation, participation in regional
and interregional exchange systems among many other aspects
of life during the Middle Ceramic period. Recently, seventeen
samples from six different sites examined during the 2009
field school were submitted for radiocarbon dating. Of these,
a single sample from the upper floor of the habitation structure at Archie King II was submitted. Later, once the flotation
samples collected during excavations completed this fall are
processed, another sample for dating from the lower floor will
be submitted.

Texas Archeology Month Celebrates 20th Anniversary
María de la Luz Martínez, Texas Archeology Month Coordinator, Texas Historical Commission

Approximately 25,000 people across the state participated in this year’s Texas Archeology Month (TAM) celebration, an enduring vehicle that has been used by the Texas
Historical Commission (THC) to tell the real stories of Texas’
archeological past for 20 years.
Coordinated by the THC in association with the Texas
Archeological Society, the Council of Texas Archeologists,
and the THC’s Texas Archeological Stewardship Network
(TASN), TAM comes to life each year through the work of
hundreds of volunteers around the state who plan and execute
special events in their communities. Local TAM event hosts
and sponsors include state, local, and regional archeological
societies; county historical commissions; museums; educational institutions; municipal, county, state and federal agencies; and private firms.
“This year, there were 106 TAM events in 68 cities,” said
THC State Archeologist Pat Mercado-Allinger. “We would
like to thank the Texas Archeological Society and the Council of Texas Archeologists for their longstanding assistance.
We also would like to extend a special gesture of gratitude
to the dedicated members of TASN who help organize and
participate in TAM events each year.”
This October’s TAM celebration included tours of rarely
seen sites where the public viewed rock art, village ruins,
open quarry pits left by prehistoric inhabitants, and even
areas of a historic battleship that are only open to the public
during TAM. Activities included archeological fairs, frontier
festivals, a father of Texas celebration, talks and presentations, simulated archeological digs, historical reenactments,
exhibits, Native American crafts, park interpretations, conferences, artifact viewing and identification, a brewery tour, and
many others.
A number of significant activities ran past this year’s October celebration. Among them are the following three events.
• “Art of the Red River War,” an exhibit at the PanhandlePlains Historical Museum (PPHM) in Canyon (on the
campus of West Texas A&M University), is the first of
its kind to focus on this particular aspect of the history
of the American West. The exhibit, which is open until
February 14, assembles depictions of the events leading
up to and including the 1874–1875 U.S. Army campaign
in the Southern Plains. Included among the nationally
known artists who were drawn to the campaign are Frederic Remington, Nick Eggenhofer, Charles Schreyvogel,

W. Herbert Dunton, and Edward Borein, as well as Texas
artists such as H. D. Bugbee, Ben Carlton Mead, John
Eliot Jenkins, and Olive Vandruff.
• A free symposium entitled “The Red River War: A
Clash of Cultures on the Southern Plains” was held
on November 7 at the PPHM. Sponsored by the THC,
PPHM, and Humanities Texas, the event featured a series
of talks presented by archeologists, historians, museum
specialists, and Native Americans who provided a range
of perspectives on the impact of this military campaign
on the history of the Southern Plains.
• An exhibit of aerial photography by Adriel Heisey called
“From Above: Images of a Storied Land” will show
through January 15 at the Centennial Museum of the
University of Texas at El Paso. The images are a kind of
archeology from above, showing the diversity of the human relationship with the earth. The exhibit was created
in collaboration with the Albuquerque Museum and the
Center for Desert Archaeology in Tucson, Arizona.

Caddo Pot in the
White House
Contributors—Karen Fustes, Sandy Rogers
Jeri Redcorn is known for her Caddoan Pottery
and is a longtime friend of TAS. She now has one
of her Caddo pots on a shelf in the Oval Office. The
Obamas are decorating their private spaces with
more modern and abstract artwork than has ever
hung on the White House walls and new pieces by
contemporary African-American and Native American artists are on display. Jeri is a Native American
artist from Norman, Okla. who uses the same pottery techniques her Caddo ancestors relied on 500
years ago.
Jeri has brought her beautiful pots to TAS Annual Meetings. She assisted Harry Shafer in the
2007 TAS Ceramics Academy held in Nacogdoches.
Many attendees felt that her sharing of her perspective was the highlight of the Academy.

Consider Volunteering
Jennifer Ramage
Thank you for the honor of hosting the 2009 TAS
Annual Meeting in Del Rio. SHUMLA looks forward to
continuing to work with the membership of TAS in the
near future.
Our programs would be impossible to carry out without the help of dedicated volunteers. SHUMLA has several
volunteer opportunities this coming year, and we would
like to invite you to join us.
SHUMLA’s educational day programs provide five,
50 minute learning stations. Students rotate through

experiential learning activities including Friction Fire,
Atlatl, Plant Adaptations, Geology, and Paint Making.
We would love to share this incredibly rewarding experience with you. Whether you are interested in assisting
our instructors or becoming a lead instructor yourself, we
have a place for you. Opportunities are available for being
directly involved with the students or helping out behind
the scenes. Volunteers willing to give their time and talents
not only contribute to increasing public awareness of the

importance of the rock art of the Lower Pecos, but also
provide meaningful mentorship to a child. This is an excellent learning opportunity for volunteers, while providing
participants the chance to gain a new appreciation of the
environment and this unique cultural heritage.
If you would like to lend a hand, please contact
SHUMLA’s Volunteer Coordinator, Jennifer Ramage, at

Gault Site Archaeologist Joins
Texas State Faculty
Ann Friou, Texas State University
October 2009—Dr. Michael Collins, archaeologist and
director of the world-renowned Gault archaeological site
in Central Texas, has joined the faculty of the Department
of Anthropology at Texas State University-San Marcos.
Collins, who will hold the post of research professor, will
continue his research on the Gault site through Texas State.
The Gault site is the world’s largest Clovis-period excavation, and Collins has been conducting work there since
1998. Recent discoveries at Gault and elsewhere predating
Clovis have convinced most archaeologists that a culture
existed in the Americas at least 500 to 1,000 years before
Clovis, possibly arriving by boat and on foot from Europe
as well as the Pacific Rim.
Collins has received a $214,000, two-year grant from
the National Science Foundation to continue his pre-Clovis
excavations, which will involve Texas State anthropology
students and archaeologists from around the world.
“If we find what we think we’re going to find, it will
change American archaeology. We may start talking about
the Florence Culture or the Gault Culture coming before
Clovis,” said Dr. Clark Wernecke, Executive Director of
the Gault School, an educational outreach program begun
by Collins to further understanding of the Gault project’s
significance. The Gault School offers public workshops
and volunteer opportunities involving participants in excavations and lab work.
The Gault project’s Clovis-era discoveries have
changed archaeologists’ ideas about Clovis culture, as well.
Whereas Clovis peoples have been thought to be nomadic
mammoth hunters, excavations at Gault show that they

were established as hunters and gatherers, like the cultures
that spread across the continent a few thousand years later.
“This is a whole new way of thinking about what is still
recognized as America’s earliest culture,” Wernecke said.
Dr. Jon McGee, Chair of the Department of Anthropology, said the Gault research complements the research
interests of the Anthropology Department faculty and the
department’s Center for Archaeological Studies.
“The work will draw national and international scholarly attention to Texas State and bring outside scholars
to campus,” McGee said. “Undergraduate and graduate
students will be able to participate in field research at the
Gault site, gaining valuable hands-on training and experience. Students will also be able to take part in laboratory
research, including M.A. thesis projects.”

Remembering Sam
Clark Wernecke
Merle Samuel Gardner II, “Sam” passed away on September 2, 2009 at the age of 50. Son of a military family he
was born in an army hospital in Colorado to Merle and Sandra
Gardner. Sam was well-traveled and often spoke fondly of his
days in Portugal.
Although Sam did not start out in archaeology he used to
say he got here as soon as he could. After getting a Master’s degree in safety engineering from Missouri State University Sam
worked for several large insurance companies and oversaw such
diverse jobs as the Alamodome in San Antonio and the renovation of Old Main at Texas State University in San Marcos.
Sam had two interests that defined him and his friends,
railroads and history. Sam worked with the Austin Steam
Train Association and his home was filled with railroad
memorabilia. His interest in history led him eventually to
archaeology and he took courses at the University of Texas
at Austin, one of which brought him to the Gault site in 1999.
I first met Sam in 1999 at the Gault site. We used to laugh
about “wet” screening while standing in 30-degree weather
and rain. He was not only a hard worker but was also willing

to learn and he seemed almost driven to it. You had only to
mention some paleoindian site within his hearing and the following week he would be reading the site report and asking
questions about it. Sam worked with the professional crew at
Gault from 1999-2002 and became very adept at excavation
discovering, among other things, the first evidence for occupation before Clovis at Gault.
Back in the Gault lab after 2002 Sam was a wizard at
digital photography. He has multiple photo credits in books,
posters, magazines and television. He was especially proud
of his work on the book Clovis Stone Tool Technology which
is due out in 2010. Sam’s pictures are as close as one can get
to 3D in only two dimensions.
Most of us will remember Sam as a friend. He was the
best friend you could possibly have. Recently I heard a story
from a graduate student who was working with us. She was
talking to Sam about artifact photography and he had given
her a number of pointers but added that she would of course
need a decent camera. Then Sam, being true to form and
much to her shock and delight, actually gave her his old mint
condition SLR camera. That’s just the kind of guy Sam was.
I like everyone who knew him, will miss Sam a great
deal. We’ll miss his sense of humor and his laughter and,
particularly, we’ll miss that feeling that no matter what, Sam
would have your back.
