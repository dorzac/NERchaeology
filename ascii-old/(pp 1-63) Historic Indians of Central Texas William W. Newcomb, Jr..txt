Historic Indians of Central Texas

William W. Newcomb, Jr.

ABSTRACT
This paper summarizes the history and ethnohistory of the Native Americans
who lived in the central part of Texas between approximately the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries until the 1850s.

INTRODUCTION
The intent of this paper is to summarize what is currently known about the
Indians of the central part of Texas, from its indigenous people of the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries to the last decimated tribes who were forced out of the
area while Texas was a republic. During those centuries, a succession of varied
Indian peoples inhabited or dominated the region. Some of them, such as the
Lipan Apaches and the groups who coalesced into the Wichita tribe, are relatively
well known. Knowledge of many others is scant, sometimes limited to a single
mention of their names. However, in most cases, some evidence can be marshaled
to suggest at least the outlines of their cultures.
Very little new or unpublished data have been utilized in these pages, but for
several reasons this is not merely an exercise in paraphrasing and reshuffling wellknown information. Focusing on a relatively small area to identify and summarily
discuss the cultures of the Indians who inhabited it over a span of about 300 years
gives the discussion a special perspective. In a general, more wide-ranging study,
poorly known peoples can or must be neglected in the interests of the larger
picture. In a localized study such as this one, no such license is desirable or
possible; the ignored and the poorly known must be considered. Many studies that
deal with the natives of Central Texas also have appeared in rather obscure and
scattered publications so that they are unknown or not easily located by any but
persistent seekers. This information, so far as it has been discovered, has been
incorporated into these pages.
These varied factors lead to the creation of a different and presumably more
accurate portrayal of the Indians of Central Texas. But this study should not be
regarded as the final, definitive word about its natives. It is, rather, a progress
statement designed to encourage others to seek additional information that will
amplify and correct the imperfect tale related here, just as this study has modified
or rejected some old, widely held notions about Central Texas Indians.

remained unknown to Europeans. In the early years of the eighteenth century,
almost two centuries after Europeans had begun to explore portions of what is
now Texas, they finally became familiar with what we term Central Texas.
Although its native peoples had not directly experienced these alien invaders, the
presence and approach of Europeans had affected them in a number of ways.
First, during the northward advance of the colonial Spanish empire in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Indians of northern Mexico and southern Texas
were forced to labor in mines and on ranches; many were gathered into missions,
and large numbers succumbed to introduced diseases. Others escaped their oppressors by moving northward away from their homelands into central and other
parts of Texas.
Second, by the beginning of the seventeenth century, Spaniards were establishing ranches and settlements in the Santa Fe vicinity far to the west of
Central Texas. Indians were employed or forced to labor for the Spaniards at
various menial tasks, including caring for horses and other livestock. Soon such
Indians were escaping their servitude on the backs of the Spanish horses they
had come to know and value. Horses spread rapidly, particularly among nomadic
bison hunters of the High Plains, and inevitably many aspects of native cultures
were dramatically altered. Of particular significance to Central Texas, newly
mounted warriors enjoyed a tremendous advantage over pedestrian enemies, and
by the mid-seventeenth century mounted Apaches were terrorizing native groups
to the east and southeast of their High Plains homeland, causing them to flee,
some into Central Texas. Before the century was over, Apache raiders themselves became familiar with Central Texas and for many years were its most
feared and powerful people.
Third, the arrival of French explorers and traders in the Mississippi River
valley in the closing years of the seventeenth century also affected Central Texas.
Indians equipped with firearms supplied by the French soon were able to expand
into the Southern Plains. Its native peoples, including various Caddoan-speaking
peoples whose descendants were to become known as Wichitas, began a southern
migration that carried some of them into the Central Texas region.
Central Texas was, then, a refuge by the time its peoples became known to
Europeans. However, it probably was not a refuge dictated solely by the vicissitudes
and consequences of European exploration and settlement, for the region was
peculiarly suited to serve as a haven for the dispossessed. It was (and is) one of
environmental diversity and rich potential, so much so that peoples moving into it
from surrounding areas almost certainly could continue to follow their traditional
techniques for wresting a living from the land. No doubt, some found it an even
more bountiful land than the one they had known. To the hunter and gatherer
recently fled from the arid and semiarid reaches of northeastern Mexico and
southern Texas, Central Texas must have seemed a verdant oasis, well watered
and blessed with abundant game and other wild foods, known previously, if at all,
for their scarcity. For the bison hunter evicted from the Edwards Plateau to the
southwest or the plains country to the west and northwest, Central Texas also

supported large numbers of bison, particularly in the winter, as well as deer, bear,
and other game. The western Cross Timbers flanking the region on its northwestern
borders and the eastern Cross Timbers extending into its heart may have afforded
such refugeeâs safety not available from mounted raiders farther west. Similarly,
the Post Oak Belt (El Monte Grande of the Spaniards), extending from south of
San Antonio northeastward to the Red River, and bordering the southeastern third
of the area, also provided a haven from attack. For the Wichita-speaking Caddoans,
Central Texas was hardly different or less attractive than their homelands farther
north. Wood for fuel, housing, and defensive work was abundant; water was
plentiful; easily cultivated soil was available along many of the river valleys; and
there was good pasturage for the horses and mules the Indians had acquired.
As is true of many rich, transitional, crossroads communities, the Central
Texas area may have always experienced the comings and goings of diverse
cultural groups. Lacking geographic barriers, it was also open to influences from
the varying cultural groups surrounding it. The most influential of these peoples in
early historic times lived to the east of the Trinity River in the Neches and
Angelina River valleys. They were the populous, settled, gardening, southern
Caddoan-speaking tribes of the loosely organized Hasinai "confederacy." Somewhat more distant in the great bend of the Red River was another group of
Caddoan-speaking tribes, generally known as the Caddo proper or Kadohadacho
(Swanton 1942:7-14; Newcomb 1961:279-313). Some of the Hasinai tribes placed
considerable reliance on bison, and their hunts carried them into the prairies of
Central Texas and into direct contact with its natives. What other contacts and
relationships existed between the people of the two areas is unknown, but like
other technologically more productive, politically better organized, and more
numerous people, it may be surmised that the Caddoan tribes of East Texas
exerted considerable influence and perhaps dominance over the natives of Central
Texas.
By the mid-eighteenth century, the thrust of Apache expansion was waning. Attrition brought about by years of conflict with Spanish and Indian enemies had taken its toll, and powerful new foes from the north and west had
entered the area. Comanches rode out of their Rocky Mountain homeland by the
early years of the eighteenth century to elbow their way into the Southern Plains.
By mid-century, an enduring alliance had been forged between the Comanches
and southward-moving Wichita-speaking plainsmen. The combined forces scattered the Lipan and other Apache bands who for half a century and more had
ridden roughshod through Central Texas, and the region soon came to be settled
by Wichita speakers.
Nor did the end of the century mark the culmination of the tumultuous story
of the Central Texas Indians. Fragments of a number of tribes, uprooted from their
homes east of the Mississippi--Shawnees, Delawares, Kickapoos, Cherokees,
and others--were forced westward by the advance of American settlement even
before the opening of the nineteenth century, to pass through and sometimes linger
in Central Texas.

EARLY EUROPEAN EXPLORATIONS

In the fall of 1528, some members of the P~infâdo de NSa-v~iez expedition were
cast ashore in the vicinity of Galveston Island on the Texas Gulf Coast. Only a
handful of these shipwrecked victims survived the winter, and one of them, Alvar
Nti~ez Cabeza de Vaca, ultimately became a trader between hostile native groups.
He claimed to have traveled along the coast 40-50 leagues (approximately 105132 miles) and as far into the interior as he wanted to go (Hodge and Lewis
1907:56; Newcomb 1983). But if he wandered as far inland as Central Texas, he
said nothing about its people. Ultimately Cabeza de Vaca was able to join three
other survivors, and they escaped their captors. After a remarkable trek across the
continent, they rejoined their own people in Mexico in 1536. There has been
disagreement among scholars about the route Cabeza de Vaca and his companions
followed across Texas and Mexico, but it is now clear that from the lower
Guadalupe River region of Texas, they traveled south into northeastern Mexico
before turning westward, never coming near Central Texas (Krieger 1955, 1961;
Campbell and Campbell 1981; Newcomb 1983).
Hemando de Soto, made wealthy by the plunder he had accumulated in
Central America and Peru, was authorized by the Spanish crown in 1537 to
conquer, pacify, and settle what is now the southeastern United States. He landed
his army in the vicinity of Floridaâs Tampa Bay in the spring of 1539, and over a
period of three years the expedition pillaged its way through the southeastern
United States. In the spring of 1542, apparently near St. Joseph, Louisiana, de Soto
died of a fever and his weighted body was cast into the Mississippi River. He had
named Luis de Moscoso his successor, and it was decided that the expedition
should return to Mexico by land, thus being forced to cross Texas on its way to the
outpost settlement of P~inuco (near modern Tampico) on the Gulf Coast (Swanton
1985:xliii-xliv).
Several weeks after de Sotoâs death, the westward march was begun, and by
the middle of July the army was near the Red River, probably above present-day
Shreveport, Louisiana, where the first of the sedentary Caddoan-speaking gardeners, the Amaye, were encountered. After crossing the river, the army veered
abruptly toward the southwest, probably more to the south than west. In the
following weeks, the Spaniards wandered around in Hasinai territory, often being
led astray by native guides. Consequently, the precise route cannot be traced,
although many of the peoples encountered Nasoni, Nacanish, Anadarko, Hais-can be associated with known Hasinai tribes (Swanton 1942:32). There is no
reason to believe these or other Caddoan speakers the army encountered had
abandoned their homelands in the middle reaches of the Angelina and Neches
valleys by the time they became better known to the Spaniards and French in the
last decades of the seventeenth century.
The identity of other groups met by Moscosoâs men is unknown or speculative. The army was led, for example, to a place (or people) called Soacatino. It is
possible that this group was known to the French in the late seventeenth and early

Newcomb -- Historic Indians of Central Texas

eighteenth centuries as Kanohatino and to the Spanish as Cantona (see below).
These natives reported they had heard of Christians to the south. The army
continued on in this direction for an unknown distance, ultimately reaching a
province called Guasco. The term was mentioned in the seventeenth century by
Casafias, but not in other documents. From Guasco, the army traveled to a
settlement of Naquiscoca, whose inhabitants at first denied any knowledge of
Christians, but after some natives were tortured the army was directed to
Nacacahoz, which they then said had been visited by Christians. Two daysâ travel
took the army to Nacacahoz where a woman said she had been a captive of
Christians. She later admitted this was a lie and the army returned to Guasco.
Neither Naquiscoca or Nacacahoz can be associated with any later Hasinai tribes,
although they were undoubtedly Caddoans (Swanton 1942:8).
The Indians of Guasco now told the Spaniards that ten daysâ journey to the
west (or six days to the south and southwest according to another chronicler) there
was a river called Daycao "where they sometimes went to hunt in the mountains
and to kill deer; and that on the other side of it they had seen people, but did not
know what village it was" (Swanton 1985:263). Swanton (1942:32) identified the
river as the Trinity, but this appears to be doubtful for two reasons. Six or ten daysâ
travel west or southwest from known Hasinai territory would have taken the army
well beyond the Trinity, and the mountains mentioned by Elvas and Garcilaso
must refer to the Balcones Escarpment and the Edwards Plateau southwest of the
Brazos River.
The sources are contradictory about what the army did after reaching the
Daycao River. One account indicates horsemen only crossed the river and climbed
its bank; another says that horsemen were given good horses with instructions to
travel eight or nine days in search of some place that had corn (Swanton 1985:263).
According to Garcilaso de la Vega (said to be the least reliable of the expeditionâs
chroniclers), three groups of horsemen were sent westward to scout the land. All
groups returned in 15 days to give similar reports: they had ridden more than 30
leagues (78 miles), finding lands "very sterile and sparsely populated, and moreover even worse the farther they advanced" (Varner and Vamer 1951:520). It is
probable, then, that Moscosoâs horsemen were the first Europeans to reach southcentral Texas.
The Indians encountered west of the Daycao River lived in small huts, raised
no crops, and the captives Moscosoâs men took spoke a language that none of his
Indian hostages understood. Swanton speculated (1942:32, 1985:280) that they
were Tonkawas, Bidais, or Aranamas. As will be shown, at that time the Tonkawas
were probably in Oklahoma, the Bidai homeland was well to the east or northeast
of this area, and the range of the Aranamas was near the coast along the lower
Guadalupe and San Antonio rivers (Newcomb 1961:316; Campbell 1976a:33-34).
The Spanish description of the land beyond the Daycao River is apt to be
misjudged since the horsemen were searching for populous settlements whose
people could be exploited, and their corn and other provisions appropriated.
People were scarce and agricultural produce wanting to the west and southwest;

hence to Moscosoâs horsemen the land was unattractive. Realizing that the
expedition could not be victualed by such peoples and that they would likely
starve before they reached P~inuco, the Spaniards retraced their steps, ultimately
reaching the Mississippi River. There, boats were constructed and the survivors
were able to descend the Mississippi and journey along the Gulf shore to PS_quco.
While the de Soto expedition was rampaging through what is now the
southeastem United States, far to the west Don Francisco V~isquez de Coronado
led an army of more than 1,000 men northward out of Mexico in search of the
seven golden cities of Cibola. The cities turned out to be the adobe villages in New
Mexico of the Pueblo Indians known today as Zunis. Thwarted by the absence of
the expected wealth at Zuni and elsewhere in the Pueblo country, Coronado and
his army spent the winter of 1540-41 in the vicinity of modem Albuquerque and
Bemalillo (Coronadoâs â"Figuex").
The Spaniards found three captives among the Pueblos, Xabe, Isopete, and a
man they called el Turco (the Turk), because to them he looked like one. The
captives were plainsmen, and Isopete and probably the other two as well were
natives of a land called Quivira. Coronadoâs men learned from el Turco that it was
a wealthy kingdom where there were great cities built of stone, and its people used
gold vessels and possessed other fiches (M. Wedel 1982:119-123; W. Wedel
1959:585-587). Whether el Turco consciously deceived them or was misunderstood is not clear. In any case, Xabe half-heartedly agreed with his countrymanâs
description, but Isopete did not. The Spaniards had been fooled or perhaps their
greed led them to hear what they most wanted to hear, for Coronadoâs army rode
eastward into the Southern Plains that summer in quest of Quivira and gold. They
were guided by el Turco, but Isopete was brought along as well.
The first natives they encountered, on the Llano Estacado in the Canadian
River valley, was a camp of Querechos. It is generally agreed they were Apaches,
although it is impossible to determine which of the later Apache tribes were their
descendants. They were friendly, the Spaniards found them intelligent, and they
conversed readily with the Spaniards through el Turco by means of a sign language. The Querechos were bison hunters who followed after the herds, using
dogs to haul their meager possessions. Bison flesh was eaten raw or to Spanish
tastes "only half cooked." They also ate fruit, but did not grow corn or "eat
bread." Their tipis were made of tanned bison skins, and surplus hides were taken
to the Pueblo country, toward Quivira, or to the east to trade. The Spaniards
also noted that the Querechos made rope from bison skins and from their "wool"
(Winship 1896:506, 527, 570). Their culture may be thought of as the ancestral
type from which developed the flamboyant, hard-riding, warlike Plains Indians
of later history.
Heeding the advice of el Turco, Coronado swung to the east and southeast,
then skirted and apparently entered Palo Duro Canyon in the Texas Panhandle.
Here, five days after leaving the Querechos, some men who were out hunting fell
in with a painted and tattooed people called Teyas. As they traveled down the
canyon and its river, the Prairie Dog Town Fork of the Red River, the army

Newcomb n Historic Indians of Central Texas

encountered other Teyas settlements. The Teyas were enemies of the Querechos
and also bison hunters who lived in tipis while hunting. But the Teyas were also a
horticultural people. They traded with the Puebloan villages to the west but they
had also made devastating raids on them (Winship 1896:506-507, 527, 570, 581;
Hammond and Rey 1940:237-239, 263). It is probable that the Teyas were a
Wichita-speaking plains people or speakers of some other Caddoan language
(Hughes 1968:247-255; Harrington 1940:512; Swanton 1942:35).
Coronado learned from the Teyas that el Turco was not guiding the army
toward Quivira. He had the Indian put in chains, most of the army was sent back to
the Pueblo country, and with a picked group of about 30 horsemen, Coronado
turned northward, now guided by Isopete. More than a month later the party struck
the Quivira River, the modern Arkansas, in the vicinity of Ford, Kansas, and after
rounding its northerly bend they encountered the first settlements of Quivira,
located along the Little Arkansas River (W. Wedel 1942, 1959:20).
Coronado spent more than a month in Quivira, visiting a number of scattered
settlements between the great bend of the Arkansas and the Smoky Hill rivers. The
names of two of the settlements located in the most remote and distant part of
Quivira were recorded by expedition members. The most populous was Teucarea
and the other was called Tabas, where incidentally the Spaniards garroted el
Turco. Teuearea is synonymous with the Tawakoni and Tabas with the Taovaya,
both subdivisions of the later Wichita tribe (M. Wedel 1982:121). Coronado and
his men did not find the wealth they sought, and with winter approaching they
rode back to the Southwest guided by six natives of Quivira.
Other explorations of southwestern Texas and the Southern Plains were
made by Spaniards in the last two decades of the sixteenth century: ChamuscadoRodrfguez in 1581-82; Espejo in 1582-83; Castano de Sosa in 1590-91; and Leyba
and Humafia in 1593 or 1594 (Bolton 1908:135-158, 163-195; Hammond and Rey
1953:416-419). While these explorations provide no information about the native
peoples of Central Texas, they served to excite Spanish interest in more distant
lands and led to the beginning of settlement in the Santa Fe area in 1598. In that
year, Don Juan de Ofiate led some 400 soldiers, priests, and families into the
region. They brought with them 7,000 animals, including 300 mares and colts.
Within a few years, the local Pueblo Indians had been defeated and temporarily
cowed, the capital established at Santa Fe, and the surrounding country was
beginning to be dotted with settlements and ranches.
In June 1601, Ofiate set out to explore the little known plains to the east. The
expedition was composed of more than 80 hand-picked men, two friars, more than
700 horses and mules, as well as carts pulled by mules and oxen, four cannons, and
an undisclosed number of servants (Hammond and Rey 1953; Newcomb and
Campbell 1982:30). On reaching the Canadian River friendly bison-hunting
Apaches were encountered. The term Querecho had been dropped in favor of
Apaches, Vaqueros, or Vaquero Apaches. Following the Canadian eastward the
expedition continued to meet Apaches for 100 leagues, or about half-way across
the Texas Panhandle. Their scattered bands were composed of no more than about

8

100 persons, usually less. On their frequent moves a woman led the way, followed
in single file by small dogs laden with tipis and other camp gear. The other women
and children brought up the rear. The men traveled "at a distance to one side,
within sight in battle array, scouting for the enemy, or for game such as buffalo or
deer." The bow and arrow was the principal weapon; men also carried leather
shields and war clubs "with a stone at the end like a hatchet and a strap for the
wrist." Women wore deerskin skirts, men apparently little or nothing in warm
weather, although "a sort of buckskin jacket which reached to the knees" is
mentioned. In cold weather, both sexes wrapped themselves in dressed bison-skin
robes. Surplus bison hides, meat, and fat were traded to the Pueblo Indians for
corn, cotton blankets, and tobacco (Hammond and Rey 1953:839, 852-853,864).
After encountering sand dunes, apparently those just east of the Texas
Panhandle, the expedition veered toward the northeast leaving the Canadian
River. Continuing in this direction, in late August or early September, some 200
leagues (520 miles) to the northeast of Pueblo San Gabriel, a large encampment of
Indians was encountered, probably about 25 miles northeast of present-day Ponca
City, Oklahoma. Members of the expedition termed the Indians Escanjaques after
the word they uttered when greeting the Spaniards. But their collective name for
themselves was Aguacane, and they were composed of eight "pueblos" whose
home territory likely lay along the North Canadian River in the vicinity of
Watonga, Oklahoma. The farthest downstream subdivision was termed
Yahuicache; upstream from it on the same side of the river were Ahaccache,
Yuhuanica, and Ahaccapan. On the other side of the river were Cochizca,
Cochpane, Aguacane, and Eguacapac (Newcomb and Campbell 1982:32).
These people are pertinent to the story of the Indians of Central Texas in
several ways. These names are in a Wichita dialect, and two of them, Yuhuanica
and Aguacane, can be associated with peoples who later frequented Central Texas.
Yuhuanica is most probably a variant spelling of Yojuane, an ethnic group that has
been heretofore identified as a Tonkawa subgroup. Aguacane is phonetically
similar to Tawakoni and Iscani, both of which became components of the later
Wichita tribe. Other evidence indicates that the Tawakonis and Aguacanes were
distinct peoples, and that by the middle of the eighteenth century the Aguacanes
had begun to merge with the Iscanis, a Wichita subdivision (Newcomb and
Campbell 1982:37).
Six members of the expedition estimated that the Aguacane camp numbered
between 5,000 and 6,000 people; one eyewitness estimated its population at only
4,000. There were other Aguacane divisions but expedition members did not
learn where they were (Hammond and Rey 1953:751,785, 807, 841, 883-884,
889). A manuscript map of the camp bears a note stating that the settlement
contained 650 dwellings, suggesting that each of them accommodated about eight
persons (Bolton 1908:facing page 212). The Aguacanes were bison hunters who
also consumed venison, wild fruit, and roots. Whether or not they grew corn in
some or all of their "pueblos" is open to question (Newcomb and Campbell
1982:34). Apparently, they erected two kinds of movable dwellings; one was

Newcomb ~ Historic Indians of Central Texas

circular, dome-shaped, and covered with bison skins or grass; the other was
similar or identical to the hide-covered conical tipis the Spaniards had seen in
use among Apaches. Discounting one improbable estimate of house size, the
largest structure was estimated at slightly less than 29 feet in diameter.
Three members of the expedition described Aguacane men as being tall and
well proportioned while another described them as being more robust than the
Indians of Mexico, and also "dark" with "ugly features." Two Spaniards thought
the physical features of the Aguacanes were like those of the Apaches they had
met earlier, and three men had a low regard for their cleanliness, terming them
"dirty." Apparently, Aguacanes of both sexes tattooed their bodies, and warriors
painted themselves before going into battle. In the warmth of late summer, the
men wore little or no clothing. Women covered their "privy parts" with soft skins
and some also "wore a sort of cloak" (which anatomical parts seventeenth century
Spaniards considered privy is unclear). In cold weather, men and women wrapped
deerskins and bison hides about their bodies.
Aguacane warriors were skillful archers, and they also employed short
hardwood clubs with large pieces of flint affixed to one end and a looped strap at
the other to prevent loss during battle. For defense they used large bison hide
shields. The initial encounter with the Aguacanes was peaceable, and the
Aguacanes volunteered to join in a campaign against an enemy people of a "Great
Settlement." Not only were these two peoples old enemies, but they "killed and ate
each other" (Hammond and Rey 1953:843). Ofiate did not accept the offer, but the
Aguacanes followed the Spaniards to the Great Settlement anyway. When the
Spaniards prevented them from looting and burning it, the Aguacanes became
hostile. The Spaniards, restricted by their carts, had to pass through or close to the
Aguacane camp on their return journey. As they approached the camp their
advance guard was attacked and some of their horses wounded by Aguacane
warriors. Thus, forewarned, the Spaniards prepared for battle and were attacked
by 1,500 warriors, whose numbers were augmented throughout the affray. The
battle raged somewhere between two and four hours, and during it the Aguacanes
retreated to some rocks near the river from which they dashed out from time to
time to shoot arrows at the Spaniards; one participant said the Indians set fire to
the prairie grass. The Spanish finally broke off the contest and were able to retreat
to their former camp. During the battle they captured some warriors, including one
they called Miguel. Between 30 and most of Ofiateâs men had been wounded, but
they were not subsequently harassed or attacked by the Aguacanes. The old
assumption that Plains Indians engaged only in hit and run raids with few participants is obviously wide of the mark.
The Great Settlement was eight leagues (about 21 miles) beyond the Aguacane
encampment and was probably located on the Walnut River, just above its
junction with the Arkansas River near present-day Arkansas City in southern
Kansas (W. Wede11942:18-20, 1959:223; Newcomb and Campbell 1982:30). It is
evident that it was a scattered settlement of one of the Wichita-speaking tribes,
possibly the Tawakonis.

The settlement extended along both sides of the fiver for three or four daysâ
travel, perhaps a distance of 30 miles (Hammond and Rey 1953:844, 857). One
member of the expedition counted 1,700 grass-covered houses over a span of two
leagues (5.2 miles) as they traveled alongside the settlement, and many more
houses could be seen in the distance. Another testified that four soldiers had
"counted the houses and found there were close to two thousand" (Hammond and
Rey 1953:846). One member of the expedition guessed that the population of the
settlement was 20,000, a figure that does not seem excessive. The Spaniards were
also told that this settlement was small compared to others located to the north,
and the Aguacanes indicated that there were other dispersed settlements farther
down the Arkansas River.
The houses of the settlement were 30-40 paces apart and clustered in groups
of 30-40. The clusters were separated from one another by 200-300 paces, with
gardens of corn, beans, and squash between them, and extending beyond them
but within sight of the houses (Hammond and Rey 1953:844, 846). Evidently
this settlement pattern was a reflection of their social groupings; the house clusters probably represented a number of nuclear families related to each other
through the maternal line (Schmitt and Schmitt n.d.; Newcomb 1961:264-267).
The houses were the distinctive "grass" or "straw-covered" lodges that
Wichitas continued to construct and live in until the late nineteenth century. As
described by members of the expedition, they were round structures, about 25 feet
in diameter, "two spears high" that accommodated eight to ten persons (Hammond
and Rey 1953:844-845).
Adjacent to the houses were wooden structures that intrigued Ofiateâs soldiers. O~ate related that

all had a flat roof or terrace, about six feet high, with room for three or
four persons, which they must have used in the summer, and which
they entered through a suitable small straw door. To enjoy the fresh air
they climbed to the top by means of a portable wooden ladder, and
there was no house which did not have a terrace [Hammond and Rey
1953:754].
One of the soldiers added that "on the outside there were wooden ladders to
climb to small wooden terraces that they had for storing corn, and we saw corn in
many of them. Inside we saw grinding stones resembling the metates used by the
Indian women in Mexico, but we did not see any pestles. We saw some ollas and
jugs of brownish clay" (Hammond and Rey 1953:857).
When the natives of the settlement discovered the Spaniards approaching
accompanied by Aguacanes, a number of their warriors on a hilltop challenged
them to battle by throwing dirt in the air, a "universal sign of war" in that land
(Hammond and Rey 1953:753). But Oilate was able to meet them peacefully,
apparently by employing the sign for peace---arms stretched toward the sun, then
touched to the chest (Hammond and Rey 1953:855). Presents were exchanged;
the Indians gave the Spaniards the small beads they wore around their necks,

Newcomb ~ Historic Indians of Central Texas

11

ears of corn, and "some round loaves of corn bread as big as shields and two or
three inches thick" (Hammond and Rey 1953:753, 857).
The Aguacanes had informed Ofiate that these enemy people still held a
Spaniard with burned feet from the Leyba-Humafia expedition. Ofiate decided
to take hostages ostensibly to gain the freedom of his countryman. Six or eight
men of the settlement were seized and placed in chains. Included was the principal chief of the settlement, and Ofiate employed the Wichita word for chief,
catarax, for him, a term, incidentally, that members of the Coronado expedition
also had picked up (Hammond and Rey 1953:754). The chief had ordered his
people to desert their settlement and they promptly did so, with the result that
the Spaniards saw few or none of its women and only some of the men. The
chief responded to questions through an aide, and the Spaniards were impressed
with the way the people obeyed him. Miguel, the captive, later told the Spaniards that their settlement had two chiefs, a "main one and a lesser one"
(Hammond and Rey 1953:874).
Various members of the expedition described the people of the settlement,
presumably men, as dark, well built, mostly naked, although "some wore buckskin hanging to the knee" (Hammond and Rey 1953:857). They painted their
bodies and "stripes extended from eye to ear" (Hammond and Rey 1953:842),
apparently referring to tattooing; footgear was also noted. Warriors were armed,
like Apaches and Aguacanes, with bows and arrows, clubs, and shields, although
they used "very short arrows, with good flint heads" (Hammond and Rey
1953:867). One of the soldiers thought the accuracy of such arrows at a distance
would be poor.
Realizing they were tremendously ou~umbered and believing that these
natives were gathering their forces to overwhelm them, O~ate agreed to return to
New Mexico. Apart from the battle with the Aguacanes the return journey of 59
days was uneventful. Although the expedition only had brief and superficial
contact with the Aguacanes and the Wichita-speaking people of the Great Settlement, several important facts emerge: First, Wichita-speakers, as illustrated by
these two groups, were not culturally homogeneous or politically united. Some
were enemies of one another. Second, Caddoan-speaking plainsmen were more
widely distributed in the Southern Plains than was formerly believed. Third, these
plainsmen were far more numerous than traditional wisdom has assumed. If, for
example, there were half a dozen grass-house settlements of Wichita-speakers
larger than the one the Ofiate expedition visited, the original population of settled
or semi-sedentary Wichita peoples considerably exceeded 120,000. Similarly, if
there were eight Aguacane divisions as large as the camp Ofiate visited, they
numbered somewhere between 40-48,000 people. It is clear, then, that Wichitaspeakers suffered a tremendous decline in the next two centuries, probably as
much as 90 percent.
Spanish interest in the Southern Plains did not ebb with the return of Ofiateâs
expedition. At least four rather poorly known expeditions probed eastward from
New Mexico in the first 60 years of the century, but none of them reached Central

12

Texas (Bolton 1908, 1911, 1912; Tyler and Taylor 1958; Williams 1962). But the
riches that might exist in these unexplored lands excited the Spaniards, particularly
their imaginative missionaries. Hoping to gain support for expanding their
activities, the missionaries wrote glowing accounts of the wealth of the native
kingdoms of the plains. In their zeal they created a mythical kingdom of Ahijados
and a nation of Cuitoas, both of which lay in a hazily defined area south of Quivira
and bordered on the east by the â~IâÂ¢xas" (i. ., the Hasinai Caddos). There was no
kingdom or people called Ahijado and a Cuitoa nation does not appear to have any
reality either (Newcomb and Campbell 1982:38-41).
While Spanish missionaries and soldiers were fitfully exploring eastward
and southeastward from the Santa FÂ¢ area, the Spanish frontier was approaching
the lower Rio Grande from the south. The impact of this advance on the natives
of northeastern Mexico fomented hostilities and small scale raids on frontier
settlements north of Monterrey and Saltillo. They "were fairly common" by the
middle of the seventeenth century and the first major expedition sent to "punish" the northern raiders was led by Juan de la Garza in 1663 (Campbell 1984:6).
The force of more than 100 men marched northward to the vicinity of modern
Guerrero near the Rio GrandÂ¢ and attacked a camp of Cacaxtle Indians, killing
100 and capturing 125 persons. In 1665, an even larger expedition was dispatched
from Saltillo, this time under the command of Fernande de Azcue, and an attack
again was made on the now entrenched Cacaxtles, probably in the southern part
of Kinney County, some 60 miles north of the Rio GrandÂ¢. It took an entire day
for the Spaniards and their Indian allies to breach the Cacaxtle defenses and
defeat the natives, killing 100 and capturing 70 (Campbell 1984:8). Ten years
later, in 1675, Fernando del BosquÂ¢ accompanied by Fathers Juan Larios and
San Buenaventura, soldiers, and Indian allies, crossed the Rio Grande, apparently near modern Eagle Pass, and continued northward into the southern
Edwards Plateau (Bolton 1908:297). While BosquÂ¢ listed the names of a number of native groups he encountered south and north of the river, only one group,
YurbipamÂ¢ (i. ., Ervipiame) can be identified as playing a part in later events in
the Central Texas area. But Bosqueâs diary is significant in several ways: it
reveals that turmoil and conflict were rampant in the region he visited, created
by the northerly advance of the frontier and possibly by the appearance of raiders from the north or northwest, although neither Apaches nor horse-using Indians are mentioned. Smallpox, introduced by Europeans, already had crossed the
Rio Grande and had decimated at least one group of natives.
Within a few years, in 1680, the Pueblo Indians of New Mexico managed to
unite and revolt against their Spanish oppressors. The rebellion was a temporary
success, with the missionaries, soldiers, and settlers being forced to retreat to the
safety of E1 Paso. The event was significant to Central Texas in that it accelerated
the spread of horses. No doubt many horses fell into Indian hands during and just
after the revolt, and many or most of them probably were acquired by plains
people to whom they were far more useful than to settled Puebloan farmers. But
after this initial windfall, horse-using Indians were forced to seek lsewhere for

Newcomb ~ Historic Indians of Central Texas

13

their mounts. That elsewhere lay to the south and southeast in Texas and northern
Mexico ~orbes 1959).
Partially in response to native requests for a return of missionaries, revival of
trade, and protection from Apaches, in 1683 the governor of New Mexico appointed Juan Domfnguez de Mendoza to lead an expedition into the Edwards
Plateau. Mendozaâs route took him from El Paso down the Rio Grande valley to
La Junta (the junction of the Rio Conchos and Rio Grande). Leaving the river
there the expedition rode northeastward, crossing the Pecos at or near Horsehead
Crossing, then turning eastward. Mendoza continued on to the vicinity of modem
San Angelo where he apparently veered to the southeast, and on the upper San
Saba or Llano River at a place he called San Clemente, a "bastion" was built. He
remained there from March 16 to May 1, 1684, hunting bison and receiving
delegations of Indians (Bolton 1908:314-343; Williams 1962).
During the journey Mendoza heard about and experienced marauding
Apaches. The Suma Indians, scattered out along the Rio Grande below El Paso,
requested help in defending themselves against Apache attacks. After crossing the
Pecos River, the Jediondos, who possessed horses, and the other local groups who
came to see Mendoza, asked him to make war on the Apaches. A few miles east of
the Pecos the Indian scouts followed the tracks of a herd of horses Apaches had
driven off, and while in the vicinity of modem San Angelo Apaches managed to
steal nine of the expeditionâs horses and mules. After six weeks at San Clemente,
Mendoza decided to return to E1 Paso because of continuing Apache attacks
(Bolton 1908:337-338).
While at San Clemente Mendoza listed 37 native groups he expected to visit
him, but who did not do so before the expedition turned homeward. A number of
these groups can be identified in later years as inhabitants of northeastern Coahuila
and adjoining parts of Texas. But also included on the list were the Hasinai Caddo
("People of the Rio de los Tejas") of East Texas, and the "Isconis," referring to the
Iscanis, a Wichita-speaking people, some of whose descendants eventually settled
in Central Texas.
In 1685, two years after the Mendoza-Lopez expedition into the west-central
Edward Plateau, the French established a colony on the Texas coast. The noted
French explorer, Ren6 Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, after having descended
the Mississippi River, had returned to France in triumph. There he organized an
expedition to establish from the sea a colony at the mouth of the Mississippi. But
ignorant of its longitude and at odds with the captain of his remaining three-ship
fleet, La Salle had his colonists put ashore late in the winter of 1685 on the shores
of Matagorda Bay. Fort St. Louis was built on Garcitas Creek at the head of
Lavaca Bay, and from there La Salle led two exploring parties to locate the river
he had so badly overshot (Weddle 1973).
These expeditions gave the French some acquaintance with the natives of the
coastal prairies and the Hasinai Caddos of East Texas, but the French did not
penetrate Cenlral Texas and had no direct contact with its peoples. On the second
expedition in 1687, however, Henri Joutel compiled two lists of natives; the first

14

Texas Archeological Society

was made at a camp or village of Teao Indians, probably 10-15 miles west of
present Lake Conroe, bordering Grimes and Montgomery counties on a western
tributary of the San Jacinto River (Cole 1946:488-489). The Teaos had horses,
some of them had visited Spanish settlements, and their hillside dwellings counted
"... about forty huts, standing together, besides several others straggling" (Cox
1905, Volume 11:113). Joutel divided the natives into those the French had
encountered between the fort and "La Maligne" River (the lower Brazos), and
those natives who lived west and northwest of the fiver. Later, in concluding this
section of his journal, Joutel again listed the two groups, but they are not identical,
perhaps because of copyist errors. The second group, some of whom may have
been native to Central Texas, follow (when different in the second list they are
indicated in parentheses): Kannehonan (Kannehouan), Tohaka (Tohaha), Pehir
(Pirir), Coyabegux (Cagabegux), Onapien, Pichar ~ickar), Tohan (Kohau),
Kiaffess (Kuasses), Chanzes (Chancres), Tsera, Bocrettes (Teserabocretes),
Tsepehoen (Tsepehouen), Fercouteha, Panego, Petao, Petzare (Petzares), Peisacho,
Peihoum (Peihoun), and Orcampion (Orcan, Piou) (Cox 1905, Volume II: 114115; 145-146; Margry 1879-1888:288-289; see also Stiles 1906:126-127, 147).
To meet the French challenge the Spaniards dispatched six land and five sea
expeditions to locate and destroy the French fort and settlement. But by the time
Alonso de Leon found the fort in 1689, disease and the local Karankawa Indians
had destroyed the colony, and La Salle had been murdered by his own men. Father
Damian Massanet accompanied Alonso de Leonâs expedition, and at a rancheria
of Tohaha Indians on the Colorado River in the Smithville-La Grange area, met
the chief of the Nabedache, a Tejas (Hasinai Caddo) tribe. Eager to establish
missions among these powerful, settled Indians, Massanet attempted to impress
the chief with the importance of becoming Christian and in the process, having no
other presents to bestow, gave the chief two horses and his own blanket. The chief
offered to lead Massanet to his country, and the priest promised to return the
following year (Massanet 1691).
Massanet returned with De Leon in 1690; they burned the French fort and
then rode on to establish a mission, San Francisco de los Tejas, among the
Nabedaches on San Pedro Creek, a few miles west of the Neches River near
modem Weches. The Santfsimo Nombre de Maria Mission was established about
five miles to the east by Fray Francisco Casafias de Jesus Maria. Thus was
launched the first attempt to convert the Caddos and to establish Spanish control of East Texas. Early in 1691, Domingo Terfin de los Rios was authorized to
establish four missions among the Kadohadachos, two additional missions among
the Hasinais, and one on the Guadalupe River. But the natives at San Francisco
de los Tejas were already becoming hostile to the missionaries when he visited
it, and the other missions could not be established for the lack of supplies. By
1693, when Captain Gregorio de Salinas Varona arrived with supplies for the
missions, Santfsimo Nombre de Maria had been abandoned because of a flood,
and the missionaries were about to desert San Francisco de los Tejas because of
the growing animosity of the Indians.

These efforts to settle and control East Texas provide considerable data about
its natives but next to nothing about people living to the west. The only clue is a
confusing list of enemies apparently provided Father Casafias by the Hasinais.
Most of the enemies were reported to live toward the west, but an unspecified
three or four lived toward the southeast (Swanton 1942:251). Four of the tribes on
the list, Ayx, Nauydix, Nabiti, and Nondacau can be identified as non-Hasinai
Caddo tribes of East Texas. The Anao and Quibaga are not mentioned in other
documents (Campbell 1976b, 1976c); the Zauanito (as Souanetto) and Quiguaya
(as Quiouaha) were also mentioned in documents pertaining to the La Salle
expedition as enemies of the Kadohadacho, but not in later documents (Campbell
1976c, 1976d). The Tanico appear to be a non-Caddoan people Moscoso encountered in the vicinity of Hot Springs, Arkansas, far to the north of Hasinai territory
(Swanton 1985:254-255). The Sadammo nation was singled out as being very
large; they lived in bison hide houses (tipis) and had many horses and mules as
well as iron tools. Members of the La Salle expedition knew them (Caitsodammo)
as enemies of the Kadohadacho (Campbell 1976e:826-827), as did the French
castaway, Simars de Bellisle, who in 1719 mentioned them (Sadamon) (Folmer
1940:223). They were undoubtedly one of the Apache divisions or bands then
expanding eastward. Casafias also listed Canze (an alternate term for Apache) as
well as Apache. Other names on the list are Quitxix (Kichai), Tanquaay (Tonkawa),
Diujuan (Yojuane), and Canabatinu (Kanohatino, Cantona), all of whom are
discussed below. Appended to the list are two other peoples: Ca-au-cozi (a coastal
group), and Mani, who are otherwise unknown (Swanton 1942:251).
EUROPEAN AR~VAL
In 1713, Louis Juchereau de St. Denis was appointed by the French governor
of Louisiana to open an overland trade route with the Spaniards of Mexico. From
Natchitoches he traveled southwest across Texas to the mission and presidio of
San Juan Bautista on the Rio Grande, arriving there in July 1714. The surprised
commandant of the presidio, Captain Diego Ram6n, was unsure what the current
relationship was between France and Spain, and specifically if trade in these
distant lands was now authorized.
Meanwhile in Mexico City, it was decided to reoccupy East Texas. Four
missions were to be established under Fray Hidalgo with a garrison of 25 soldiers, commanded by Alferez Domingo Ram6n, son of the commandant of San
Juan Bautista, and St. Denis was hired as commissary officer of the expedition.
There were about 75 people on the expedition, and its progress was slowed
considerably by the number of livestock brought along--64 oxen, 1,000 sheep
and goats, and 4,000 horses and mules. It was the first Spanish expedition to
definitely reach Central Texas, pausing for three days in June 1716 at the
Rancherfa Grande, before continuing on to the Hasinai villages. Rancherfa
Grande then consisted of an encampment of about 2,000 remnant and displaced
Indians who had joined together as a defense against Apaches (see discussion of

16

Texas Archeological Society

the Ervipiame below). According to Bolton (1915:143-144), the rancherfa was
"north of Little River and two or three leagues west of the Brazos, apparently
near modern Cameron."
A few years later, in response to the activities of the French in East Texas,
Marques de San Miguel de Aguayo, Governor of Coahuila, volunteered to lead
another expedition into the region. On May 13, 1721, the expedition, comprised of
500 mounted men and 4,000 horses and mules loaded with supplies, left the
Presidio of San Antonio and proceeded to the Colorado River below Austin.
Heavy rains and high water, and apparently the prospect of difficult passage
through the brush and forest of El Monte Grande (biotically known as the Post
Oak Belt, not the more northerly Cross Timbers as some have suggested) northeast of present Rockdale, prompted the expedition to follow the advice of Juan
Rodrfguez, Chief of the Rancherfa Grande Indians. Guided by the Indians, the
expedition rode north from the Austin area, crossed Little River east of Belton and
the Brazos near Waco. The expedition then turned to the southeast, again joining
El Camino Real at the Navasota River crossing (Buckley 1911; Gonzalez 1983;
Forrestal 1935; Webb 1952, Volume 1:17).
Fray Mariano Francisco de los Dolores y Viana, a missionary at San Antonio
de Valero, also visited the region a number of times in the 1730s while attempting
to persuade Indians who had fled the mission to return and also seeking new
recruits (Bolton 1915:149ff). The Indians he encountered, the Deadose, Yojuane,
Mayeye, and the Indians of Rancherfa Grande, were unwilling to leave their
camps or to disrupt the trading ties they had established with the Hasinai Caddos
through whom they acquired French firearms. But the Apache threat was a very
real one, which probably accounted for their friendliness, and in June 1745 the
chiefs of the four groups visited San Antonio to request that a mission be
established in their country.
Mafiano believed two or three missions would be needed for the 1,228
people of these four groups (the precise number suggesting that a census was
taken), and through his perseverance three missions were ultimately established
on the San Xavier River (now the San Gabriel), near present-day Rockdale. The
four groups were not living in the immediate vicinity, however, but to the east in
El Monte Grande, where there was no suitable site for irrigating mission fields.
The Indians agreed to the San Gabriel location even though it was perilously close
to the trail Apaches used to come down into the prairies to hunt bison.
In January 1746, Fray Mafiano selected the site for the first mission, San
Francisco Xavier, on the south side of the San Gabriel just above its junction with
Brushy Creek. Crops were planted and construction of mission buildings was
begun, but it was not until February 1747 that the missions were officially
authorized. Subsequently a second mission, San Ildefonso, was established near
the mouth of Brushy Creek, and a third, Nuestra Senora de la Candelaria, a short
distance above Mission San Francisco Xavier.
The Mayeyes, Ervipiames (Rancherfa Grande), and Yojuanes were assigned
to San Francisco Xavier;, the Atakapan-speaking Deadoses and Orcoquizas, whose

Newcomb ~ Historic Indians of Central Texas

17

homelands were southeast of Central Texas, and the Bidais whose linguistic
relationships are moot, were congregated at Ildefonso; the Cocos and related
Karankawa peoples of the coast were assigned to Candelaria (Sjoberg 1951:393;
Newcomb 1961:315-329). Bolton (1915:198) asserted that the Indians were apportioned on the basis of their cultural and linguistic relationships, and that the
groups assigned to San Francisco Xavier were "all related to and allied with the
Tancahue (Tonkawa), a few of whom were there also." This particular allegation
was erroneous as will become evident.
The missions on the San Gabriel survived only a few years as they were
plagued by Apache raids, epidemics, difficulties with the soldiers stationed there,
and other problems. For its Indians and others in Central Texas it was a time of
tumult and change, strife, new alliances, migration of new groups into the region,
and consolidation and disappearance of smaller and weaker ones. In order to more
readily comprehend these Central Texas Indians and what became of them after
the mid-eighteenth century, they will be taken up individually.
Yojuane
When the Yojuanes were first mentioned in 1601, as previously noted, they
were one of eight divisions of a Wichita-speaking Plains Caddoan group whose
collective name was Aguacane. Ninety years later Casafias listed the Yojuanes
(Dijuan) as one of a number of Hasinai Caddo enemies (Swanton 1942:251). The
Yojuanes had apparently migrated south and east in the intervening years to
Central and North Central Texas, and they were to become one of its prominent
groups until after the middle of the eighteenth century.
Additional information about the Yojuanes is supplied by the EspinosaOlivares-Aguirre expedition which visited a short stretch of the Colorado River
between present-day Austin and Bastrop in 1709 (Tous 1930; Gonzalez 1982;
Campbell 1983). Missionaries had heard that the Tejas (Hasinai Caddos) had
moved southwestward to the Colorado River, and wanting to reestablish a mission
among them, a small party of soldiers and missionaries hurried northward. Their
information was faulty and they found no Hasinais on the Colorado; instead they
encountered four bands of Indians whose names they recorded as Simaomo,
Cantona, Tusonibe, and Yojuane. The Yojuanes were evidently newcomers to the
vicinity since no earlier documents mention them on or south of the Colorado
(Campbell 1983:2-3). Their former hostile relationship with the Hasinais had
apparently altered as Espinosa said that "the Indian captain of the Yojuanes, called
Cantona comes and goes to the Texas with his people," and he agreed to take a
message to the Hasinais (Gonzalez 1982:6). But the friendly relationship of the
Yojuanes with the Hasinais was short-lived, since they were said to have destroyed the principal temple of the Hasinais near the Angelina River in about 1714
(Bolton 1915:146).
The Simaomos and possibly the Tusonibes had migrated to Central Texas
from northeastern Mexico, but the Cantonas appear to have been native to the

18

Texas Archeological Society

Colorado River region (Campbell 1983:3-5; see under Canohatino-Cantona below).
In subsequent decades all three of these groups declined in numbers and were
absorbed by other groups, possibly including the Yojuanes; in fact, the encampment
visited by this expedition may represent an instance of this process of
amalgamation. That the Yojuane leaderâs name was that of the allied group makes
sense in this context.
Espinosa included a sketchy description of these four groups in his diary,
but it is impossible to know whether it applied to one or all of them. His account
is consistent with what is known about the Yojuanes from the Ofiate documents.
The camp the Spaniards visited numbered about 2,~ people who lived in huts,
otherwise not described. They wore little or no clothing, and if they painted,
tattooed, or ornamented their bodies in other ways, Espinosa neglected to mention it. They were hunters, who at least at this season depended on bison for
their livelihood. Campbell (1983:6) suggests that they were probably following
the herds as they slowly moved northward. The number of people in a single
camp may have been "made possible by an abundance of bison in the open
grassland areas of Bastrop and Travis counties." The size of the camp also may
have been a defensive measure taken against Apache marauders, particularly
since the expedition was not able to make contact with these Colorado River
Indians until their "spies" had assured themselves they were not Apaches
(Gonzalez 1982:6). Espinosa was particularly impressed by the novel manner in
which the Indians greeted his party, remarking that:
as soon as we dismounted, they surrounded us with such insistence and
determination that we knew not where to turn. They were giving shouts
of joy, they were embracing us, they were reaching up to our faces and
arms, and then doing the same in their faces as if softly rubbing
[untando, the word for anointing] them or incorporating [embodying]
themselves with us. This is their custom when they want to make
others their friends or family members. As a matter of fact, there was
not an Indian man, woman or youth left who did not touch us to their
heartâs content. They would even bring breast-feeding babies so that
we could caress their faces-with less than that they would not be happy
[Gonzales 1982:7].
Less than a decade later St. Denis was told by the Hasinais that the Yojuanes
were among the nations north, northwest, and west of the Asinais. The others
mentioned were
the Tancahoe [Tonkawa proper], the Quihuugan, [Quiguaya, Quiouaha,
Quichuan?] Guanetjaa, the Nodacao [Anadarko], the Quitzais [Kichais],
Saccahe, Nauittij, Canohatinoo [Kanohatino], Conux, Tahoangaraa
[Tohaha], (and) Cahineo, and there are others whose names he does
not remember. He knows of them from what he has heard the Tejas say
and by reports which they themselves have heard. These nations do not

Newcomb ~ Historic Indians of Central Texas

19

have villages nor fixed abodes because of fear of the Apaches [Shelby
1923: 177-178].
St. Denis also included a brief, collective ethnography of these peoples:
All these nations which he has named used bow and arrows .... Each
nation is governed by its cacique, or captain, alike when they are settled
and when they are not, because they always have a chief who governs
them in peace and in war, but he has subaltern captains, some for the
government of the nation in war, and others in time of peace and for the
management of the villages. The declarant has observed these things
among the Tejas, and the same is true regarding the others, for that which
one nation observes the others with little difference, observe also.
Regarding meat and other supplies, the property of these nations is
communal, because that which anyone obtains by fishing is for the
nation, and likewise that which he gets by hunting. With regard to the
wives, these are not communal, since they are married in their style to
the Indian men; but the spinsters are. The husband has charge of the
wife and children, but if she has no children, it is customary to (temporarily) abandon her, she being blamed meanwhile. Some (husbands)
repudiate them for good. They support their wives and children by
hunting, fishing, and with roots, tubers, and other fruits of the trees.
All these nations have horses and ride them, but do not eat them,
having them to utilize among themselves. They do not cultivate the
fields, which are fertile [Shelby 1923:178-179].
In the fall of 1718, Jean-Baptiste Brnard, Sieur de La Harpe, secured from
French authorities in Louisiana permission to settle on the Red River among the
Kadohadachos above the settlement of Natchitoches. The following spring La
Harpe established a post just above a Nasoni village on the south side of the river,
about 12 miles northwest of modern Texarkana, in the vicinity of the Hatchel
archeological site (M. Wedel 1978). During the spring and summer, La Harpe
dispatched several expeditions. One of these, under Sieur Du Rivage, was sent up
the Red River to make alliances with any natives who might be encountered, and
to gain information about the Spanish settlements to the west. The small force rode
up the north side of the river 70 leagues (about 182 miles) where it encountered a
joint war party of Quidehais [Kichai], Naouydiches [Nabedache], Jojuan
[Yojuane], Huanchane, Huane, and Fancaoye ~onkawa] (M. Wedel 1971:64, fn
31; Bell, Jelks, and Newcomb 1967:251). The identities of the Huanchane and
Huane are unknown; Bolton (1910a:888) speculated that both were Wacos. Since
the Wacos (a Wichita subdivision) did not emerge as an ethnic entity until the
nineteenth century, this suggestion should be dismissed.
La Harpe described these groups as nomadic bison hunters, who together
counted 2,500 warriors. They were normally scattered so that they could more
easily secure food, but this war party had joined forces to make an attack on the

20

Texas Archeological Society

Cancy (Apaches) 60 leagues (156 miles) farther up the river. La Harpe also
mentioned that these tribes were allied with the Quichuans, a people who lived
two leagues south of the Red River somewhere between where he met the allied
war party and his post on the Red River. Mooney (1907, Volume 1:701) identifies
them as Kiowas, an improbable speculation since the migration of Kiowas into the
Southern Plains did not occur until almost a century later.
In the next several decades, the Yojuanes continued to roam over parts of
North Central Texas between the Trinity and Brazos rivers. In 1727, they were
reported to be on the Trinity River northwest of the Hasinais (Wheat 1957,
Volume I: Map no. 115), and as noted they were one of the tribes that petitioned
the Spaniards for a mission in 1745. A substantial number of Yojuanes were at
the mission for a time, but before it was abandoned most of them had left (Bolton
1915:190, 231). In 1754 some Yojuanes were reported to be living in a generally northerly direction from the Spanish settlement of Nacogdoches (Anonymous 1754:2).
It is apparent that Yojuane numbers had dwindled drastically, no doubt as a
result of warfare with Apaches and other enemies, and probably through introduced diseases. Their decline was accelerated in 1759 when they were surprised
by a Spanish army led by Don Diego Ortiz Parrilla. Some background is necessary
to understand the Yojuane involvement in this and other events then taking place
in Texas. For many years the Spaniards had been in conflict with Apaches, but
they were unable to subdue them. But by the middle of the eighteenth century,
Apaches--primarily Lipans--were beinghard-pressed by the Comanches, their
Wichita allies, and other Indian enemies, and there were signs that they might be
willing to settle down in missions. Consequently a mission and presidio were built
by the Spaniards in 1757 on the San Saba River, near present Menard, for the
Lipan Apaches. Virtually no Apaches could be persuaded to remain at the mission
for any length of time; nonetheless this new alliance enraged the Apacheâs
enemies. Central Texas Indians, including those who had been in the three
missions on the San Gabriel, made common cause with the powerful allies of the
north, the Wichitas and Comanches, to make war on their old Apache enemies and
their newly found Spanish supporters (Dunn 1911, 1912, 1914; Tunnell and
Newcomb 1969; Weddle 1964).
In the winter of 1757-1758, the Spaniards at San Saba heard rumors of an
impending attack, and during the last days of February, 59 horses were stolen on a
night raid despite a guard over their pasture. The soldiers sent out to recover the
horses could reclaim only one, and they reported ominously that the country was
crawling with Indians. Six men were dispatched to warn a detail which had been
sent to escort a supply train coming from San Antonio. While camped on the
Pedernales River they were attacked. Four men were wounded, but they managed
to get through to the supply train. A message sent to the San Saba presidio said
their attackers were Tonkawas, Bidais, and Yojuanes. Their identity was known
because a corporal in the party had been at the presidio of San Xavier and was
acquainted with them (Weddle 1964:68-69; Tunnell and Newcomb 1969:146ff;

for descriptions of Lipan culture see Opler 1936, 1940, 1945; Sjoberg 1953b,
Newcomb 1961:103-131).
The attack was a harbinger of things to come, and in March 1758 a combined
force of Wichita, Comanche, Hasinai, and other Indians, including Yojuanes and
Tonkawas, attacked the mission. Fathers Terreros and Santiesteban plus eight
other persons were killed, and the mission was pillaged and burned. The presidio,
located several miles away, was not attacked, but its soldiers were unable or
unwilling to come to the aid of the missionaries.
Ortiz Parrilla, commander of the presidio, proposed and was placed in
command of a retaliatory campaign. He gathered together about 380 militiamen
and presidial soldiers, 90 mission Indians, 30 Tlascaltecos from Saltillo, and 134
Lipan Apaches, numbering over 600 men. In August 1759, the army rode from
San Antonio to the San Saba presidio, and thence northward into the lands of the
"Nortefios." On October 2, on the "Rio del Fierro" (the Brazos or perhaps its
Clear Fork) (Cabello 1786), Ortiz Parrilla surprised an Indian rancherfa. He
attacked it and in an hour "fifty-five Indians were killed and one hundred and
forty-nine were taken prisoner;" none of his force was killed (Orfiz Parrilla
1759). The Indians attacked were not identified, but it is clear from other documents referring to the expedition that they were Yojuanes (Cabello 1786; Bell,
Jelks, and Newcomb 1967:262-263). Not satisfied with the destruction of the
Yojuane camp, Ortiz Parrilla continued on to the Red River guided by Yojuane
captives, to be drawn into a battle which had a very different outcome (to be
discussed below).
How serious this blow---or massacre--was to the Yojuanes is difficult to
judge. But if the four groups that petitioned Father Mariano for a mission in
1745 were numerically balanced, and they totaled 1228 people, then it is likely
that upwards of two-thirds of the Yojuanes were lost, or conversely that about
100 were neither captured nor killed (Bolton 1915:148). Even assuming that some
of the captives escaped and that some Yojuanes were elsewhere when the camp
was assaulted, it is apparent that this episode was a catastrophe for this once
numerous people.
In 1767, the Yojuanes were reported to be between the upper Sabine and the
Red River (Kinnaird 1958, end paper map), but in the following year Gaspar Jos6
de Solis found the Cocos, Mayeyes, Yojuanes, Tonkawas, and other unspecified
peoples in an area near the junction of the Little and Brazos rivers of present-day
Milam and Robertson counties. De Solis remarked that the:
nations are distinguished from one another by the stripes that they
paint on themselves in one manner or another, also in the cut of the
hair. Some of them have a tonsure like the Fathers or monks, others
keep the forehead shaved and let the hair grow on the back of the neck,
leaving a lock or motote on the crown of the head, the length of the
natural hair of which they take great care, others cut it off; some bore
holes in the muscles of the nose, others in the ears, but all nations have

22

one thing in common, that is the sign-language, with which they talk
not only for hours but entire days [Kress and Hatcher 1932:58].
Athanase de M6zi~res, a Frenchman who entered Spanish service after the
transfer of Louisiana to Spain and served as Commandant and Lieutenant Governor of the Natchitoches district, encountered Yojuanes in the same area in 1772,
still associated with Mayeyes and Tonkawas. It has long been assumed that
subsequently the Yojuanes were absorbed by the Tonkawa tribe, and at least in
one case their amalgamation with the Tonkawas can be documented. One of the
Yojuanes captured by Orfiz Parrilla was an eight-year-old boy named Miguel
Peres, after the Spaniard who raised him. His oldest brother and father had
escaped the Yojuane massacre and joined the Tonkawas, with whom they remained. But they frequently visited Miguel in San Antonio. After El Mocho, the
Tonkawa chief, was killed, Miguelâs brother succeeded him. That other refugee
Yojuanes joined the Tonkawas after the massacre, or after Miguelâs brother
became the Tonkawa leader, seems highly likely (Cabello 1786).

Canohatino-Cantona
The Canohatino (appearing as Ayano, Canatino, Coannotino, Kanoutinoa,
Konatine, and Quanoatinno in French documents) are one of the most enigmatic
ethnic groups associated with Central Texas in the last years of the seventeenth
and the first decades of the eighteenth century (Campbell 1976f:463). The name
first appears in documents of the La SaUe expedition. During that period the
Caddos of East Texas, as well as non-Caddoan peoples of East and Southeast
Texas, were acquiring horses. Some groups seem to have had an ample supply, but
others few or none (Cox 1905, Volume 1I:147). Some horses were probably
acquired through trade, but others were taken by raiding better supplied peoples to
the west, among whom were the Canohatinos. When La Salle and his party were
among the "Teao," for example, the Indians talked ofa"great nation called Ayona
and Canohatino" (Cox 1905, Volume II: 115). The â~eaos" stole horses from the
"Canohatinos" and also mentioned that the "Canohatinos" were at war with the
Spanish. Douay adds that the Hasinais were also enemies of the "Kanoatinos," a
people said to be "cruel to their enemies, whom they boil alive" (Cox 1905,
Volume 1I:248). Some of La Salleâs men accompanied a Hasinai war party that
attacked the "Kanohatinos," and the usage of French firearms resulted in a highly
successful raid, but none of its details were recorded (Cox 1905, Volume II: 162165). Le Clercq (La Salleâs biographer), contrary to Joutel who stated that they
heard of but did not see the Canohatinos, remarked that
we crossed great prairies to the Maligne [probably the Brazos River since
there were no extensive prairies east of the Trinity or Navasota, but
Blackland Prairies are extensive northeast of the middle reaches of the
Brazos from northeast Fails County northward]. This deep river, where
one of our men had been devoured by a crocodile [i.e., alligator], comes

Newcomb ~ Historic Indians of Central Texas

23

from a great distance, and is inhabited by forty populous villages, which
compose a nation called the Quanoatinno; they make war upon the
Spaniards and lord it over the neighboring tribes. We visited some of
these villages. They are a good people, but always savage, the cruelty of
the Spaniards rendering them still more fierce. As they found us of a
more tractable nature they were charmed with our nation; but after these
mutual presents we had to part. They gave us horses cheap and carried us
over their river in hide canoes [bull boats] [Cox 1905, Volume I:240].
The most informative account of the Canohatinos was written by Cavelier,
La Salleâs brother, who may have been referring to the encounter mentioned by Le
Clercq:
In the morning, when about to march, we perceived one hundred and fifty
Indians, all on horseback, armed with lances tipped with sharpened bone,
well tied and encased, each of whom attacked a bull. No sooner had they
perceived us when some of them left the party and came to welcome us,
after dismounting. They at first regarded us with astonishment, and, after
having examined us, they uttered extraordinary exclamations. They then
made us mount, the more conveniently to witness the close of the bullfight, which seemed to us the most diverting thing imaginable, and I am
convinced that there is no chase as curious in Europe. When the combat
was ended by the death of several animals the combatants came galloping to us and, giving many tokens of surprise and joy at meeting us, they
led us away to their village. Their frank and cordial manners made us
follow them without repugnance. They often uttered the word Kanoutinoa,
pointing to themselves; this made us suppose that it was the name of the
nation. They took us straight to the cabin of their great chief, or captain,
where they first washed our heads, hands and feet with warm water, after
which they presented us boiled and roast meat to eat and an unknown
fish, cooked whole, that was six feet long, laid in a dish of its length
[alligator gar or catfish?]. It was of a wonderful taste and we preferred it
to meat. They told us by signs that they were abundant and came from a
distance, ascending the river.
We bought at this place thirty horses, which mounted us all and
carried our baggage. They cost us thirty knives, ten hatchets and six
dozen needles. On the 19th we crossed the river on their boats and our
horses swam over [Cox 1905, Volume I:290-291].
Campbell (1976g:248) has raised the possibility that the Canohatino of the
French were the Cantona of the Spanish, variously transcribed as Canabatinu,
Cantanual, Cantujuana, Cantahuhaone, and Cantuna. He states that "both groups
occupied the same general area at the same time, and their cultures as known seem
to have been similar. This question can be answered only by further archival
research." That the Spanish and French would hear and transcribe a native name,

24

Texas Archeological Society

very probably composed of unfamiliar sounds and combinations of sounds, in
different ways is highly likely, and it seems probable that the Canohatino and
Cantona were a single ethnic group. French allusions to Canohatino warfare with
the Spanish suggests that they were in conflict with New Mexican Spaniards since
nothing similar to Kanohatino appears in Spanish documents relating to southern
Texas or northern Mexico. But no documentation supporting this speculation has
been discovered, so that the earlier homeland of this group is in doubt.
In the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, the range of the
Canohatino-Cantona was on the Blackland Prairies between the Guadalupe and
Trinity rivers to the east of present-day San Antonio, Austin, and Waco. Europeans usually encountered them in encampments with other tribal groups, as was the
case of the Espinosa-Olivares-Aguirre expedition of 1709. This has led to their
being given a variety of linguistic and cultural classifications, but as Campbell has
noted (1976g: 143): "It is clear that linguistic identification on the basis of association leads nowhere in the case of the Cantona." But if their identity as latter-day
Soacatinos is correct as suggested earlier, they were in all probability Caddoan
speakers.
The Canohatino-Cantona were ultimately absorbed during the last half of the
eighteenth century by the Tawakoni and Iscani subdivisions of what became the
Wichita tribe, then inhabiting northerly parts of the old Canohatino-Cantona
range. That they would choose to unite with a people with whom they were
linguistically and culturally related, rather than with a more alien group, supports
the Caddoan-speaking thesis.
Mayeye

Henri Joutel of La Salleâs expedition was the first European to mention the
Mayeyes as "Maghai" and "Meghty" in 1687, listing them as one of the groups
encountered between Fort St. Louis and the Maligne River, southeast of the Waco
area (Cox 1905, Volume 1I:114; Stiles 1906:127, 147; Margry 1879-1888, Volume III:288). They do not appear, then, to have been native to Central Texas. In
1718-19, the Alarc6n expedition encountered Mayeyes, as well as the Sana, Emet,
Toho, and perhaps the Yojuane west of the Brazos River (Hoffman 1935:69). In
1727, these groups were mentioned as being 15 leagues (39 miles) west of the
junction of Little River with the Brazos at a spring called Las Puentezitas, perhaps
on Little River or one of its tributaries between Bartlett and Temple (Bolton
1915:145). In 1732, Bustillo y Zevallos, in a campaign against Apaches, led a
force northward across the San Gabriel River, becoming acquainted with the
Indians of that region (Bolton 1915:141; Dunn 1911). As quoted by Bolton
(1915:146): "the Mayeye customarily came down from the Brazos de Dios to the
Nabasoto (Navasota), and ranged from there to the Trinity." Bustillo last had
contact with them in 1734 when he noted that this small tribe (as well as the
Deadoses) had not increased in size because of measles and smallpox epidemics
"which are their sole destroyers" (Bolton 1915:148). An anonymous document

Newcomb ~ Historic Indians of Central Texas

25

written in 1748 asserted that"the country of the Mayeye was on the east side of the
Brazos, eighty leagues [208 miles] from San Antonio and twenty [52 miles] from
the place of San Xavier" (Bolton 1915:146).
Fray Mariano also became acquainted with the Mayeyes in the 1730s, and as
has been noted, they were among the petitioners for a mission in 1745. In 1749,
there were 86 Mayeyes at San Xavier mission, and the small number of women
and children represented in this group was attributed to Apache attacks (Bolton
1915:190). When the mission effort was abandoned, 41 of the Mayeyes who had
been at San Xavier moved to the springs on the Guadalupe, near present-day San
Marcos. They acknowledged that this location was outside their territory, but they
were agreeable to a mission being established there for them. The poorly known
mission was not successful, probably because of Apache attacks, and it was
abandoned before 1758 (Bolton 1915:276-278). Some Mayeyes were at Mission
San Antonio de Valero in the 1750s and 1760s (Hodge 1907-1910), and in 1768,
as De Solis noted, at least some of the Mayeyes had returned to the San Gabriel
area where they were found associated with Yojuanes, Tonkawas, and Cocos.
Some moved to the Gulf Coast with the Cocos and were assimilated by this
Karankawa band. Others remained with the Yojuanes and Tonkawas. Sjoberg
(1953a:281-282) has suggested that the Tonkawa tradition which held that some of
their tribe became separated from the main body and were known as the "Drifted
People," refers to that portion of the Mayeyes who joined the Cocos. It tends to
confirm the Mayeye assimilation by the Tonkawa tribe, as does the fact that one of
the tribeâs clans was named Mayeye.
Next to nothing is known about the Mayeyes culturally and linguistically; it
can be inferred, however, that they were a nonagricultural hunting and gathering
group who relied heavily on bison, at least while they occupied the San GabrielLittle River watershed, which was said to be "superb buffalo country" (Bolton
1915:44, 142). They may never have been a numerous people, and as early as the
1730s Apache assaults and introduced diseases had reduced them to no more than
a few hundred people.

Ervipiame
Ervipiame, Chivipane, Cibipane, Hierbipiane, Huvipane, Hyerbipiame,
Yerbipiame, and Yrbipia are considered synonymous (Campbell 1976h:283). The
Ervipiame were first known in northeastern Coahuila and adjacent parts of Texas
between 1670-1688, and were one of the groups encountered by the BosqueLarios expedition of 1675 in the southwestern part of the Edwards Plateau (Bolton
1908:297; Campbell 1979:13). They were usually associated with groups of
Coahuilteco-speaking Indians, and it is assumed that they were members of this
speech family. During this period the Ervipiames were generally hostile toward
Spaniards and Indian groups of the area, but by 1698 some had entered missions in
northeastern Coahuila. Displaced with other groups by the Spanish and Apaches,
they migrated to east-central Texas after 1707, and were usually found between

26

Texas Archeological Society

the Colorado and Brazos rivers. They became the dominant members of an
assortment of Indian groups that had fled the Spanish and their missions (Bolton
1914, Volume I:329-331, 1915:143-145; Hodge 1907-1910, Volume II:354). This
consolidated group of remnant and refugee Indians became known as Rancherfa
Grande, or Rancherla Grande de los Ervipiames. A map of this period by Alvarez
y Barrero notes that "Rancherfa Grande [was] composed of the remnants of 22
nations broken up by the Apaches" (Wheat 1957, Volume I, no. 115).
Several years later, in 1716, Diego Ram6nâs expedition stopped at their
encampment near present-day Cameron. It then numbered 2,000 persons, as has
been noted (Bolton 1915:143-144). In 1721 Marques de Aguayo met Juan
Rodrfguez, a chief of the Rancherfa Grande Indians, at San Antonio, where the
Indian had come to request a mission for his people. Aguayo employed Roddguez
to guide his expedition to East Texas, and at the Trinity River they found the
Rancherfa Grande Indians in association with Bidais and Agdocas (Deadose).
Aguayo asked Juan Rodrfguez and his people to move back across the Brazos
River, promising that he would establish a mission for them near San Antonio.
Their eastward movement and request for a mission was undoubtedly a response
to Apache attacks. Aguayo did establish a mission, San Xavier de Naxera where
Mission Concepcion is now located. It was not successful, and in 1726 it was
merged with San Antonio de Valero (Bolton 1915:144).
When Bustillo y Zevallos was governor of Texas in 1732-1734, Rancheria
Grande had dwindled in size; its people continued to live between the Trinity and
the Brazos. They were, as has been mentioned, one of the groups that petitioned
for a mission in their territory, and in March 1749 there were between 63-70
Ervipiames at the San Xavier mission (Bolton 1915:190, 198). By the summer of
1750, their number at the mission had shrunk to 41 (Bolton 1915:230), and when
the mission was abandoned in 1755 some Ervipiames entered San Antonio missions. But others and perhaps a majority, along with Tonkawas, Mayeyes, and
Yojuanes, moved closer to the Taovaya village on Red River in the next few years,
associating themselves with the Comanches and Wichita speakers, now joint
enemies of Spaniards and their new Apache allies (Francisco Delgado et al. 1759).
In the last decades of the century, it appears that the remaining Ervipiames were
absorbed into the Tonkawa tribe.
Tonkawa
It has been long assumed that the Tonkawa tribe was indigenous to Central
Texas (Bolton 1910b:998-999; Sjoberg 1953a; Newcomb 1961:133-153). But
considerable doubt has been cast on the literal accuracy of this assumption by
information revealed by Miguel, an Indian captured by Ofiate in 1601 during his
battle with the Aguacanes (Newcomb and Campbell 1982; Campbell 1983:3).
Miguel was later taken to Mexico City where he testified that he had been
captured as a boy of about 12 by the Aguacanes in the "pueblo of Tancoa"
(Hammond and Rey 1953:874). The word is almost certainly an orthographic

Newcomb ~ Historic Indians of Central Texas

27

variant of Tonkawa. Tonkawa is the Wichita (Waco) name for these people, not
their own term for themselves (Gatschet 1891:36-37), and it is reasonable that
Miguel used the Wichita term for his own people since he had lived with the
Aguacanes for a considerable number of years. Miguel was questioned about
various native settlements, and the map that was prepared under his direction
suggests that Tancoa probably was located between the Salt Fork and the Medicine Lodge rivers in North Central Oklahoma (Newcomb and Campbell 1982:31
and Figure 2).
Apparently, the Tonkawas (or Tancoas) were forced out of their homeland
by the rapid expansion of mounted Apaches in the seventeenth century, and they
drifted into Central and North Central Texas. Their first mention in Texas was
by Fray Francisco Casafias de Jesus Mafia in 1691, who listed them (Tanquaay)
as one of the enemies of the Hasinai Caddos (Swanton 1942:251). By 1717, when
mentioned by St. Denis as the Tancahoe with other tribes of Central Texas, they
were no longer at war with the Hasinais (Shelby 1923:178). In the following
year, as noted, a war party that included Tonkawas, was encountered on the Red
River by Du Rivage, returning from a raid on Apaches, and during the next
several decades the Tonkawas continued to range over part or parts of North
Central Texas.
Tonkawas were never represented in the San Xavier missions in any appreciable numbers. In fact, part of the opposition to the establishment of missions on
the San Gabriel was that the Tonkawas, as well as the Tawakonis, Kichais, and
Yojuanes were too far to the north to be drawn to them (Bolton 1915:183). A few
years after the disintegration of the missions on the San Gabriel, the Tonkawas
were among the natives who attacked the mission on the San Saba (Nathan and
Simpson 1959). In the following decades they were reported to be located between
the Trinity and Brazos rivers, generally in or close to El Monte Grande. In 1772,
De Mrzi~res included the Yojuanes (as Yocouanes) and Mayeyes (as Maheyes)
among the Tonkawas (Tancagues), and was told that they numbered in all 150
warriors "or something more" (Bolton 1914, Volume 1:289-290). They were then
allied with Tawakonis and Kichais in the common struggle against the Osages and
Apaches. He asserted that:
they have never been stable except while they were gathered in the
mission of San Xavier, whence in a short time they fled, since they care
less for instruction and civilization than for their unbridled liberty and
forays. The district in which they are ordinarily found lies between the
Trinity and Brazos Rivers. They devote themselves to hunting buffalo
and deer, from which they secure, besides their food, an incredible
number of skins, which they are accustomed to take to the village of the
Tuacanas [Tawakonis] [Bolton 1914, Volume I:290].

On his return from San Antonio, De Mrzi~res again mentioned the three groups,
who he said usually camped in El Monte Grande near the spring called Las

28

Texas Archeological Society

Puentecitas. In the spring of 1778, De Mrzi~res encountered Tonkawas in the
vicinity ofLa Tortuga, a hill near modern Tehuacana in northwestern Limestone
County. He found them
not in permanent houses and in a village, but underneath [tents] of
skins, and in various bands, which are directed, maintained, and moved
by the caprice of their petty chiefs and leaders. They number about
three hundred warriors, including not a few apostates. They are all
given to stealing, are daring, and are the ones who have taken the
greater part in the hostilities which the presidios of San Sabas, Espiritu
Santo, and Bexar have suffered [Bolton 1914, Volume II: 192].
De Mrzi~resâ eyewitness estimate of Tonkawa population in 1778 was more
accurate than the hearsay estimate he had learned about six years earlier as was
shown by subsequent events. An epidemic in 1777 had devastated Bejar,
Bucareli, and Natchitoches, as well as nearby Indian communities, and it then
spread to more remote natives including those of Central Texas. In the late summer of 1779, De Mrzi~res again visited the Tonkawas, then west of the Trinity
River. Their chief and many prominent men had died from the disease; there
remained but 150 warriors in a population probably numbering 500-600 people.
The chieftainship had fallen to an Apache who had been captured many years
earlier. Known as E1 Mocho ~he Maimed), for an ear lost in battle, he had
participated in the attack on the San Saba mission. He was anathema to the
Spaniards, and De Mrzi~res conspired w~th some members of the tribe to have
him murdered. But they succumbed to the epidemic before action could be taken.
It was not until 1784 that the Spaniards finally succeeded in killing E1 Mocho
(Bolton 1914, Volume 1I:231,265-274).
During the last decades of the century, the Tonkawas continued to roam
Central Texas, their wanderings dictated by the availability of game and plant
foods and by their shifting relationships with various Indian peoples, as well as
with the Spaniards. The more numerous Wichitas and Comanches to their north
and west seem to have gradually forced them to move southward out of Central
Texas, and in the early decades of the nineteenth century they were usually to be
found between the Trinity and San Antonio rivers (Abel 1922; Gatschet 1891;
Sjoberg 1953a:283). They were generally more of a nuisance than a threat to
Anglo-American settlers in the 1820s, and during this period they became more
amicably associated with the Lipan Apaches with whom they shared common
enemies and other problems. During the ten-year life of the Republic of Texas,
Robert Neighbors, their agent for a time, furthered this association (For their
subsequent history, near extermination, and language see Sjoberg 1953a; Newcomb
1961; Hoijer 1933).
Five poorly known native groups, the Sana, Cava, Emet, Tohaha, and Toho,
have been linked linguistically with the Tonkawas and were assumed to have
been absorbed by them. In view of the probable geographic homeland of the
Tonkawas, the presumed linguistic connection with these groups is unlikely. The

Newcomb ~ Historic Indians of Central Texas

29

Sanas, whose homeland appears to have been between the Guadalupe and Brazos
rivers, east and northeast of San Antonio, were probably at least in part absorbed
by the Tonkawa tribe, becoming its "Sanux" clan. Documentary evidence suggesting or demonstrating amalgamation of the other four groups with the
Tonkawas is lacking. These groups disappeared--joined other groups, entered
missions, succumbed to disease--before Tonkawas frequented the area southeast of San Antonio and Austin, their apparent homelands (Branda 1976, Volume III:153, 279, 852, 1016).
Vocabularies gathered from Tonkawa informants in the late 1820s, 1870s,
and 1928 contain many words that are similar or the same, but others, referring to
the same object or thing, are completely different. This replacement of words has
been credited to the Tonkawa custom of no longer using words that resembled or
were the same as names of persons who had died (Gatschet 1884: 159, 160, 209;
Goddard 1979:361). In light of the varied languages spoken by the peoples who
became "Tonkawas," it seems likely that the differing linguistic heritage of
informants played a significant if not preponderant role in such differing
vocabularies.
The Tonkawa tribe as it emerged in the last decades of the eighteenth century
was, then, a composite of disparate cultural and linguistic groups drawn from
different environmental regions. It seems to have become a relatively wellintegrated and self-consistent entity by the nineteenth century, although its cultural landscape can be understood only with reference to its complex origins. The
nature of Tonkawa culture, for example, has seemed anomalous in that it was a
non-horticultural, not very productive hunting and gathering society, particularly
after access to the rich hunting grounds of Central Texas was denied to the tribe.
Nonetheless, the Tonkawas were organized into about a dozen matrilineal clans,
perhaps grouped into two complementary but not exogamous divisions (moieties).
It is clear that some and very probably all of their clans were remnants of once
autonomous groups (Mayeye, Yojuane, Ervipiame, Sana, Tonkawa proper, and
others). That clans (and possibly moieties as well) originate from autonomous,
linguistically and culturally distinct fragments, has seldom if ever been noted in
the development and evolution of human societies.
That the varied components of the Tonkawa tribe should not only develop
the characteristics of clans, but continue to function like them was probably the
result of a number of factors. Some and perhaps all of the groups that were
absorbed by the tribe were demonstrably small. The Yojuanes, for example,
apparently numbered less than 100 persons and perhaps fewer at the time of
their consolidation. They were not numerous enough to maintain their independence, and it is likely that there were few or no marriageable persons to be found
within such a population. At the same time their sense of common identity or
ethnicity must have been strong and even enhanced as they were forced to interact with other groups with different cultural and linguistic characteristics. Thus,
their sense of "brotherhood" --their clannishness--was strong at the very time
their sons and daughters were marrying Tonkawas, Mayeyes, and others.

Kichai

The Kichais are speakers of a Caddoan language that is unintelligible to
speakers of Wichita and other dialects and languages of the Caddoan family. In
some respects Kichai (or Kitsai) is closer to Pawnee than to Wichita (Lesser and
Weltfish 1932; Chafe 1979:213-214; Parks 1979:203). The Kichais became affiliated with and absorbed by the Wichita tribe in the nineteenth century, although
some individuals as late as the 1960s were still fully aware of their Kichai ancestry
(Frank Miller, former Wichita tribal chairman and a Kichai, personal communication). The linguistic distinctiveness of the Kichais indicates a different past than
other components of the modern Wichita tribe, raising the possibility that the
Kichais also may have varied from Wichitas in other cultural respects. The
Kichais were seldom mentioned in Spanish and French documents of the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, and if they differed in fundamental ways
from Wichita speakers, such differences were not recorded. When first known to
Europeans they inhabited an area adjacent to the Red River valley in North Central
Texas. Hughes (1968:247-255) has suggested their association with the prehistoric archeological materials known as the Henrietta Focus, but Rohrbaugh (1982)
has persuasively argued that the prehistoric origins of the Kichais lie to the north
in the Arkansas River basin. Their linguistic affiliation supports this contention.
The historic remains of the Kichais appear to be part of the complex known as the
Nortefio Focus (Duffield and Jelks 1961; Harris et al. 1965).
The first mention of the Kichais (as Quitxix) appears to have been by Father
Casafias in 1691 (Swanton 1942:125). The next notice of them was in 1714 when
St. Denis was detained at San Juan Bautista and ordered his men to return to
Natchitoches. On their return journey, while at a Hasinai village, the men learned
that 150 of its men had ridden off to carry on war with the Kichais, and while still
there the warriors returned. They had two Kichai prisoners; four others had been
eaten during the return journey, and the Frenchmen witnessed the torture and
ritual consumption of the remaining two 0~enigault 1953:153-156; John 1975:204).
It is highly probable Kichais accorded Hasinai prisoners the same kind of treatment these prisoners received. Andr6 Penigault, one of St. Denisâ men, referring to
both the Hasinais and Kichais, also noted that:
These savages make war quite differently from those along the bank of
the Missicipy, for they all go on horseback, armed with a quiver made of
buffalo hide, filled with arrows, which hangs slung over the shoulder
behind their backs. They have a bow and in their left arm a small shield of
buffalo hide with which they ward off arrows. On their bridles they use
no other bit than a horsehair rope which passed through the horseâs
mouth. Their stirrups are held up by a horsehair rope that is tied to four
folds of doeskin, which serve them for a saddle. Their stirrups are merely
small boards, three inches wide and five inches long, upon which they
put their feet to mount the horse and to hold themselves upon his back
~enigault 1953:154].

St. Denis, in the interest of furthering French trade, managed to arrange
peace between the Hasinai Caddos and the Kichais, and in 1718 Bienville
mentioned the Kichais (Quitchaiiches) as inhabiting a village with three
Kadohadacho tribes (Nassonites, Natchitoches, and Natsohos) 80 leagues (over
200 miles) above Natchitoches on the Red River, apparently in the neighborhood
of Lamar and Red River counties in northeast Texas. Bienville said of the four:
they make war on the Cannecy [Apache] allies of the Spaniards. They
travel on horses and are still able to put 200 men into the field. They are
respected by their enemies although they have few firearms. They formerly numbered 500-600 men [Swanton 1942:55-56].
After B6nard de La Harpe established a trading post near modem Texarkana,
in the summer of 1719 a small party under Du Rivage was dispatched to explore
the Red River. The mixed war party the Frenchman encountered included Kichais
(Guidehais), and it was learned that the natives to the north were their allies and
that the principal nation was called Touacara (Tawakoni). Du Rivage suggested
that La Harpe would like to visit these powerful people in order to form an alliance
with them, but that he would need guides to lead him there. After conferring with
one another, the leaders of the war party indicated that they would go to the
Tawakoni village to inform them the Frenchmen were coming, and they sent two
Kichai warriors back to the post on the Red River with Du Rivage to serve as
guides (M. Wedel 1971, 1982).
The Kichais moved southward away from the Red River valley, apparently
to escape Osage raiders, probably in the 1750s. They lived too far to the north to
be attracted to the missions on the San Gabriel in the 1740s, but according to De
M6zi~res they were involved in the attack on the San Saba Mission but "participated through accidentally being with the others" (Bolton 1914, Volume I:218).
In 1768, they were mentioned by De Solis (as Quchixes) and were then living
between the Trinity and Navasota rivers, along with a number of other native
groups. In 1770, they were present at a council on the Red River at the old
Nassonite post near Texarkana in which the Wichita subtribes and various Caddo
leaders conferred with Athanase De M6zi~res. In the spring of 1772, he journeyed into Central Texas to cement the alliance he had made with its people. One
hundred leagues from Natchitoches and 20 from San Pedro, apparently south of
present Palestine in Anderson County, he visited a Kichai village and wrote the
earliest and apparently the only general description of their culture. Situated in a
"fertile little meadow crossed by a permanent arroyo," there were 30 lodges in
the village, with a warrior population of 80, "most of whom are young:"
The Quitseys women, as well as those of the villages which follow, are
industrious, devoting themselves to the cultivation of the soil; and,
considering the fact that their number is not much greater than that of the
men, they have a prodigious multitude of children. The women make the
houses, prepare the food, plant the fields, tan the skins, gather the crops,

32

and work unceasingly, while their husbands are never employed except
in war or in hunting. Their crops are limited to maize, beans, cantaloupes,
watermelons, and pumpkins. They likewise provide themselves with
various wild products, especially nuts and medlars [probably hawthorns
or persimmons], from the latter of which they make a kind of bread that is
very palatable; and they do not despise even acorns. The trade of this
village consists in bartering with the inhabitants of Natchitoches the
skins of buffalo and deer in exchange for guns, powder, balls, and other
merchandise useful for their support and defense .... It is closely allied
with the Iscanis, Tuacanas, Taouaiazes, and Ouedsitas. The people are
cannibals just like these others, and they have the same custom of
absenting themselves from their village during the cold season for the
purpose of getting a full supply of dried meat, which is kept for the other
seasons of the year. Their superstitions are excessive. They dedicate their
chief cult and veneration to an evil spirit whom they fear and try to
propitiate [Bolton 1914, Volume II:285-286].

The Kichais continued to occupy their old range in the vicinity of present-day
Anderson, Houston, and Leon counties well into the nineteenth century. Sibley,
American Indian agent at Natchitoches, called them Keyes or Keychies, and
reported that in 1805 they lived on the east bank of the Trinity River not far from
the Camino Real (Sibley 1832:722).
The Kichais did not come into conflict with Anglo-American settlers as
quickly as did the Wacos and Tawakonis, but in 1833, after being accused of
"depredations" along Cumminâs Creek in eastern Fayette County, they were
pursued and attacked by militia, losing eight to ten men. In May 1835, Kichais
again were accused of attacking these settlements, and as a result 30 Texans
marched to the Kichai village on Boggy Creek in Leon County to chastise them.
The Kichai chiefs denied guilt, but it was alleged that stolen horses and other
plunder were in the village. A fight resulted, and the Indians fled (De Shields
1912:133).
They apparently did not return to their village or the area, but moved well
beyond the white settlements to the upper reaches of the Trinity and Brazos rivers.
Although maintaining their own villages for many years, they became more
closely associated with the Wichita-speaking tribes, and ultimately were absorbed
by the modem Wichita tribe (Newcomb 1976:73ff).
Wichita-Speaking Tribes

Wichita-speaking tribes include the Taovaya, Iscani, Tawakoni, Wichita
proper, and the Waco. After their unpleasant confrontation with Ofiate and his
soldiers in 1601, Wichita-speaking peoples apparently had no further visits from
Europeans for more than a century. Their next contact was with Frenchmen
probing westward from Louisiana and the Illinois country. In the intervening
years, however, the impact of European civilization affected these remote natives

Newcomb-- Historic Indians of Central Texas

33

in a number of ways. They had acquired horses, for example, and learned the art
of horsemanship. Possession of horses might seem to have been less essential to
them than to pedestrian hunters inasmuch as their women raised an abundance of
corn, beans, and squash. But Wichitas were as eager to obtain these wonderful,
serviceable animals as were other plains natives. It was essential that they do so;
mounted hunters were also mounted warriors. To hunt afoot one might only go
hungry; to fight cavalry afoot was to court certain disaster (Newcomb 1976:21).
Wichita-speaking tribes, or at least the more northerly settlements, also
began a southerly movement late in the seventeenth century that was to carry
some of them into the Waco region. Their migration appears to have been
prompted by tribes to their north and east who had acquired French and British
firearms (M. Wedel 1982:124-125). Made militarily powerful by these new
weapons and in quest of a more adequate supply of horses, the scattered settlements of the Wichita tribes must have become fat targets for horse-hungry
raiders. On their western flank the Wichita tribes were also now confronted by
mounted Comanche raiders, new invaders of the plains. Contacts appear to have
been sporadic, but these newcomers constituted a new and growing threat. The
southern migration was not without its dangers, since old Apache enemies ranged
in that direction. But Apaches had few if any firearms; they were wealthy in
horses, as were Spanish settlements and ranches off to the south and southwest.
In short, several factors apparently were involved in the southward movement of
the Wichita tribes.
In the late summer of 1719, Wichita-speaking tribes were visited by two
separate Frenchmen, B6nard de la Harpe and Claude-Charles Dutisn6. France and
Spain had gone to war again, so it was useless for La Harpe from his post near
Texarkana to attempt to inaugurate trade with the Spanish in New Mexico.
Exploration of the unknown country to the northwest and developing trade with its
people was an attractive alternative. So, in August with the two Kichai guides and
eight other men, La Harpe struck out on horseback for the Tawakoni settlement.
The journey took more than three weeks and during it they barely avoided a
skirmish with a party of Osages and just managed to stay out of the way of an
Apache war party. For many years there was disagreement among scholars about
the location of the dispersed Tawakoni settlement, but it is now firmly established
that it was situated on a terrace (Wealaka ridge) on the south bank of the Arkansas
River below Tulsa, Oklahoma, near the town of Leonard (M. Wedel 1981:28,
1982:124; Newcomb 1979:36-38).
La Harpe and his party were ceremoniously met some distance from the
village by the principal Tawakoni chief and six chiefs of other "nations," all
mounted on beautiful horses. Following mutual assurances of friendship, members of the French party were presented with cornmeal bread and dried meat; La
Harpe was provided with a fine horse, and the group proceeded to the settlement.
The Indians had La Harpe dismount, and he was seated on a buffalo robe placed
over a plank a musket-shot away from the Tawakoni chief. The leading men
encircled him, and one after another put a hand in his as a token of goodwill. La

34

Texas Archeological Society

Harpe presented the young Tawakoni chief with muskets, powder, balls, and
cloth, and the chief gave La Harpe an eagle feather headdress, adorned with many
colored feathers and two feathers from the calumet, one for peace and one for war.
It was the most prestigious gift they could bestow.
The peoples who had gathered, in addition to the Tawakonis (Touaearo),
were the Toayas (Tawehash or Taovaya), Ousita (Wichita proper, the subdivision
whose name later came to be employed for the consolidated tribe), and Ascani
(Iscanis). Two other groups, the Adeco and Honecho, are not mentioned in other
documents; presumably they were small groups subsequently absorbed by other
Wichita-speaking tribes. Other groups mentioned were the Quiraquirit, which La
Harpe did not realize was a collective term Wichita-speaking Indians used for
themselves, and Caunuche, which was the nativesâ term for Frenchmen (M.
Wedel 1981:28).
About 7,000 persons had been attracted to the Tawakoni settlement to see
the Frenchmen, and during the next several days long, drawn out calumet ceremonies were held for the French. These were conducted by the Taovaya and
Iscani chiefs, both of whom were old men skilled in leading such ceremonies.
During them speeches were made, dances held, the calumet smoked, and presents exchanged. The climax of the ceremonies occurred when La Harpe was
carried to an arbor and his face painted. He was then presented with 30 buffalo
robes, rock salt, tobacco pressed into loaves, some mineral pigments, and an
eight year-old Apache captive. The chief apologized for having only one captive
to give La Harpe, since the 17 others in their possession had been consumed a
month earlier in a public feast.
After receiving these gifts, La Harpe reciprocated by giving the Wichitas the
presents he had brought, and several days later left the village to return to his post
on the Red River. He had planned on leaving some of his men behind, pending
approval for locating a trading post at the settlement, but he did not do so since the
Indians would abandon the settlement in November for the winter hunt, and they
would not return until March. La Harpeâs return journey was hectic since the
French no longer had the Kichai guides, food ran out, and the Caddo Indian who
had accompanied them was killed by an Apache war party.
At almost the same time that La Harpe reached the Tawakoni settlement on
the Arkansas River, Claude-Charles Dutisn6 was sent westward from the mouth of
the Missouri River to contact the Wichitas. He reached a Taovaya village, probably located on the Verdigris River near present-day Neodesha in southeastern
Kansas (M. Wede11982:124). He referred to its people as "Panioussa," "Paneassa,"
and "Panis" which were the names Osages and other Siouan-speaking people used
for the Wichita-speaking tribes. It meant "black Pawnee" and perhaps referred to
skin color but more likely to the Wichita custom of heavily tattooing face, arms,
and chest, a custom the more northerly Pawnees did not share. The French came to
refer to the Wichita-speaking peoples as "Panis Piques," meaning tattooed or
pricked Pawnees, and Americans, borrowing from them, sometimes referred to
them as "Pawnee Picts."

Newcomb ~ Historic Indians of Central Texas

35

The Taovaya village had 130 grass houses and somewhere between 200-300
warriors, and there was another village of the same size several miles upstream.
The population of each village was apparently between 1000 and 1250 people, but
between them they had only about 300 horses. The old habit of living in scattered
settlements or hamlets had been abandoned by the Taovayas. The Taovaya shift to
relatively compact villages near other villages was obviously a defensive measure
taken against enemy attacks. The Taovayas reluctantly traded two horses and a
mule with a Spanish brand to Dutisn6 for three muskets, powder, pickaxes, and
some knives. He also learned that they were at war with Apaches, ate Apache
captives, and used leather armor to protect their horses. In warfare they skillfully
employed bows and arrows and a long lance tipped with the blade of a European
sword. He was told that there were other Wichita villages off to the west and
northwest, but oddly, he was not told about the Tawakoni settlement on the
Arkansas, scarcely 100 miles to the southwest.
In 1748-1749, about three decades after La Harpe and Dutisn6 visited the
Tawakonis and Taovayas, deserters from French Louisiana made their way from
the Arkansas Post on the lower Arkansas to New Mexico. They passed through
two Wichita villages situated on the west side of the Arkansas River, identified
as the Deer Creek and Bryson-Paddock archeological sites, about one and a half
miles apart in Kay County, Oklahoma (M. Wedel 1981:5, 1982:127). One of the
villages was fortified with a stockade and a ditch. The villagers were described as
"Panipiques" and also as "Jumanos," a Spanish term employed for several different groups of tattooed natives. One or perhaps both villages were probably
"mostly Taovayas" (M. Wedel 1982:127). For a time this was an ideal location
since in about 1747 the Comanches and some or all of the Wichita-speaking
groups agreed to a mutually advantageous peace. It made the Taovayas prosperous middlemen in the lucrative trade between the Comanches and the French.
The French could ascend the Arkansas by boat as far as the twin villages, and the
villages were easily accessible to the nomadic Comanches. But in 1752, the more
northerly Pawnees also made peace with the Comanches, and French traders took
the more direct route from the Illinois country up the Missouri to the Pawnee
villages where they could trade or obtain horses for the journey to Santa Fe.
Before 1757, the villages on the Arkansas River had moved south to the Red
River where they were reestablished just west of the western Cross Timbers. A
fortified Taovaya village was situated on the north side of the fiver (known
archeologically as the Longest site, Jefferson County, Oklahoma), and an Iscani
village was located a short distance downstream. By 1765, there was a Wichita
(Wichita proper) village north of the Taovaya village and the Iscani village that
was south of the fiver (apparently the Upper Tucker site, Montague County, Texas
[Bell, Jelks, and Newcomb 1967; Calahorra 1765]).
The new settlements on the Red River (the vicinity misnamed "Spanish Fort"
by Americans who settled at the abandoned site in the mid-nineteenth century)
were excellent choices since they bordered on the Comanche range to the west,
could be reached by boat by traders from Natchitoches, Louisiana, and offered a

36

plentiful source of timber for construction and fuel. There was a good ford,
allowing easy access to the other side of the river, a fine spring, plentiful arable
land along the river, excellent pasturage for horses, and much bison and other
game. According to a Spanish soldier, Antonio Trevifio, who was captured by the
Taovayas in 1764 and lived in the palisaded village for six months, and archeological knowledge of the site, the fortification consisted of an oval, log enclosure
about 130 yards in its longest dimension, 88 yards wide, and was situated in the
middle of a dispersed village on the north bank of the river. It was constructed of
split logs set vertically in the ground and spaced far enough apart so that muskets
could be fired between them. Outside the palisade was an earthen rampart about
four feet high, and beyond it a ditch about four feet deep and more than 12 feet
wide. Inside the palisade were four underground chambers large enough to shelter
all noncombatants (Bell, Jelks, and Newcomb 1967:84-85, and Figure 26;
Calahorra 1765).
After Ortiz Parrillaâs army had surprised and decimated the Yojuane encampment in the late summer of 1759, it continued northward, willingly guided by
captive Yojuanes. Their apparent eagerness to guide the army might have prompted
a more cautious leader to proceed warily. It did not deter Ortiz Parfilla, however,
and his forces were drawn or blundered into an assault on the fortified Taovaya
village. In the ensuing battle, the army was unable to take the village and was
forced into a precipitous retreat, even losing their precious cannons (Ortiz Pan-ilia
1759; Bell, Jelks, and Newcomb 1967:262-265; Newcomb 1976:37-40).
About the time the Taovayas were establishing their fortress on the Red
River, Tawakonis and some of the Iscanis were also moving to the south. Based
on information an Osage war party provided when it visited a camp of Andr6
Fabry de la Bruy~re on the Canadian River in 1742 (M. Wedel 1981:32), the
Tawakonis had moved to the Canadian about 1737, but soon afterwards migrated
to the Red River, and in the 1740s moved farther south into Texas. They apparently first settled in a twin village located on the upper Sabine River, probably at
what is known as the Pearson Site in Rains County, now under the waters of Lake
Tawakoni, about 50 miles east of Dallas (Johnson and Jelks 1958; Duffield and
Jelks 1961). The migration put many miles between them and the aggressive
Osages, and gave them easier access to the French at Natchitoches (John
1975:305-306).
Fray Joseph de Calahorra, a veteran missionary at Nacogdoches, with a small
retinue of soldiers and settlers, joined along the way by about 100 Caddos, visited
the twin Tawakoni-Iscani village in the fall of 1760. They were met, as was
customary, about 10 miles from the twin village and escorted to it. The entire
populace had turned out to make signs of peace and warmly greet the foreigners.
They were welcomed by the four chiefs and then led to tipis especially prepared
for them. Calahorra and his party remained in the village for eight days exchanging presents and being feted and feasted in turn by the chiefs.
Only a street separated the Tawakoni and Iscani villages, and they counted
47 large dwellings, each housing 12 families. The villages had 250 warriors,

Newcomb ~ Historic Indians of Central Texas

37

suggesting a total population of between 1,~ and 1,250 men, women, and
children. Calahorra added that:
the towns are located on a beautiful meadow.., and are beautifully
arranged with both streets and gardens. Their pasture lands are abundant,
are common property, and produce fine breeding horses. Their farm
lands, which they prohibit other tribes from using, are black and firm,
and are maintained perhaps at a distance of a league from the town. They
are accustomed to plant at the proper season all together in one labor.
They gather in great abundance their products of maize, beans, and
pumpkins and immediately divide them up into equal parts. They were
constructing a fort or subterranean passage so they could defend themselves from the Spaniards or any other nation which was making war
against them [Johnson and Jelks 1958:412].
While at the twin villages, Calahorra met with a Taovaya chief and his
entourage of 20 men and six women, who represented the Red River villages. Reestablishment of peaceful relations, including the return of the two cannons and
peace with the Apaches, was discussed, and Calahorra agreed to visit them the
following summer. Calahorra returned to the Tawakoni-Iscani village the following fall, and during his eight-day visit distributed presents and gave certificates of
captaincy and canes, symbolic of that office, to the Tawakoni chief, E1 Flechado
en la Cara, and the Iscani Chief Llaso or Zurdo ("Lefty"). But old and in failing
health, Calahorra could not continue on to the Red River villages. He left with the
Tawakonis and Iscanis the symbols of office for the Taovaya chief and gifts for his
people. Calahorra never succeeded in visiting the Red River villages, and he was
unable to establish missions among either the Tawakoni-Iscani on the Sabine or
the Taovayas on Red River.
The broken promises of the Spaniards and their continued support of the
Apaches, demonstrated by the construction of Mission San Lorenzo de la Santa
Cruz on the upper Nueces River in 1761, soured the Taovayas on an alliance with
the Spanish. In the summer of 1763 the Taovayas raided the San Saba Presidio,
making off with 70 horses and killing three Spaniards, and they appear to have
been among the Norteflos who made life hazardous for the Spaniards at the
mission on the Nueces (Tunnell and Newcomb 1969).
In the fall of 1770, Athanase De M6zi~res traveled up Red River to the
village of San Luis de Cadodachos (La Harpeâs old Nassonite Post near Texarkana)
and held a meeting with Caddo chiefs and seven chiefs of the Tavaiazes (Taovayas),
Tuacanes (Tawakoni), Iscani (Yscani), and Quitseys (Kichais). During the council, one of the Wichita leaders stated that they were no longer angry at the
Spaniards and that the Tawakonis and Iscanis had "abandoned the establishment
which they had in the vicinity of San Antonio Bexar and San Saba and are to-day
living off to one side, not far from San Pedro" (the site of San Francisco de los
Tejas mission, near Weches). Exactly where this "establishment" was and how
long it was occupied is unknown (Bolton 1914, Volume 1:212).

38

Texas Areheological Society

In the following year, the Taovayas formally concluded peace with the
Spaniards at Natchitoches, ratified it at San Antonio, and in March 1772 De
MSzi~res traveled into Central Texas to cement the alliance with its natives.
After visiting the Kichai village near modem Palestine, he continued westward
about 20 miles to a scattered settlement of Iscanis. They numbered 60 warriors
and many more women and children (perhaps a population of 300). Continuing
westward seven leagues (18-19 miles), De M6zi~res visited a Tawakoni village
on the west side of the Trinity River, probably at the mouth of Tehuacana Creek.
When the river was high, it formed "a peninsula where the village is located."
The village had 36 houses, 120 warriors "with women in proportion, and an
infinite number of children of both sexes," perhaps totaling 500-600 people. De
M6ziSres described them as horsemen, who "are most cruel with their prisoners,
whose flesh they eat, after having killed them with long and unheard of torments,
horrible to mankind. They do not bury their dead, but take them to the open field"
(Bolton 1914,Volume 1:288-289). The last sentence is anomalous since there is
abundant evidence that Wichitas buried their dead (Schmitt 1952; Newcomb
1961:263-264).
From these Tawakonis De M6ziSres learned that there was another Tawakoni
village on the Brazos River, 30 leagues (about 80 miles) distant. Although its chief
was reported to be hostile to the Spanish, which had apparently caused the split,
De MSziSres decided to go there in order to "reconcile its inhabitants" and to
persuade them to move to (or move back to) the Trinity village. To reach this
village De MSzi~res "departed from the western course" he had been pursuing to
pass "through broad and pleasant plains, varied by an infinite number of groves"
(Bolton 1914, Volume 1:293). Incredible numbers of bison were encountered, but
what little water was found had been fouled by the herds, marring an otherwise
pleasant journey. The Brazos was low but he was so impressed with the natural
advantages of the site and its location with respect to various settlements that he
recommended a presidio be established there. The village counted 30 families, and
like those previously visited there was a large number of children, suggesting a
population of 150-200 people.
The location of the village cannot be positively determined from the documents; it may have been the Stansbury site, two miles above the Lake Whitney
dam and now under its waters (Stephenson 1970:42, 59-61,277-283), or as Story
(1985:83) suggests, the Stone site, some 20 miles downriver. As early as 1765,
Antonio Trevifio had reported a Tawakoni village about 50 leagues (130 miles)
south of the Spanish Fort villages, apparently on the Brazos, and he was likely
referring to this village (Calahorra 1765).
A few years later, in the spring of 1778, De MSziSres again visited the
villages of Wichita speakers in the Waco region (Bolton 1914, Volume II:193196). After leaving the Kichai settlement at or near its earlier location, and failing
to find the Tonkawa headmen in the vicinity of La Tortuga, he continued westward 16 leagues (about 42 miles) to the Brazos. The river was up, but the
Tawakonis from the village on the west bank assisted his party in crossing. It is

Newcomb m Historic Indians of Central Texas

39

evident that De Mfzi~res had not visited this village before, and his letter implies
that its friendly residents had recently moved from their Trinity River village to
this site. He remarked that:
this village contains about one hundred fifty warriors [perhaps a total
population of 600-750]. It is located in a fertile plain protected from the
overflows of the fiver that bathes it by a high, thick wall [meaning bank],
at whose base rises a spring from which the inhabitants drink and from
which they could draw the water necessary to irrigate the broad plains
where they have planted their crops, but they are ignorant of this advantage [Bolton 1914, Volume II:195].
One hundred apostate Xaraname (Aranama) Indians had settled near the village
and De Mfzi~res importuned the Tawakoni chief to persuade them to return to
their mission. A Tonkawa chief also appeared, and the Tawakoni chief, at the
Frenchmanâs urging, suggested that the Tonkawas settle down in a permanent
village.
Story (1985:83) suggests this village was at the Stone site, about eight miles
upriver from Waco, but the Barron Branch site in what is now downtown Waco is
also plausible. Both are about 40 miles from La Tortuga, although the distance
between the Stone site and the one 20 miles above it, which De Mgzi~res next
visited, agrees better with the distance between the Stone and Stansbury sites than
the Barron Branch and Stansbury sites.
From the lower Tawakoni village De Mgzi~res rode up the Brazos to
another village "which here especially is very attractive, one of its banks consisting of a pleasant meadow and the other of beautiful hills" (Bolton 1914, Volume
I: 196). The village was larger than the lower one and De Mgzi~res indicated that
it was the "Chief Post," or principal Tawakoni village (Bolton 1914, Volume
I: 196-197). From this village De Mgzi~res rode northward, keeping the eastern
Cross Timbers to his fight, and a week later reached the villages at Spanish Fort.
His description of the people and their lifestyle is refreshingly ample, and since it
probably applies equally well to their relatives on the Brazos it is quoted at
length. The village on the north bank had 37 houses, the larger on the south side
of the river counted 123:

Each dwelling contains from ten to twelve beds, considering which fact a
conservative estimate places the number of men, including youths, at
more than eight hundred, while that of the women and the children of
both sexes is very large. Their dress, consisting only of shirts, leggins,
and moccasins, is of skins; their leather shields, horse equipment, and
camping tents are of the same material. Their foresight in supplying
provisions shows them to be industrious, for there is no house in which at
present there may not be seen four or five vessels full of maize, each one
estimated at four and a half fanegas, besides a great quantity of beans and
calabashes. [It was April so that these crops had been harvested the

previous year.] They preserve the latter [pumpkins] from year to year,
weaving them curiously like mats. In addition, they raise watermelons
and tobacco in great plenty .... The fish [in the river] are of the best
varieties, but they do not care for them .... Their government is
democratic, not even excluding the women, in consideration of what they
contribute to the welfare of the republic. The women tan, sew, and paint
the skins, fence in the fields, care for the com-fields, harvest the crops,
cut and fetch the Inâe-wood, prepare the food, build the houses, and rear
the children, their constant care stopping at nothing that contributes to
the comfort and pleasure of their husbands. The latter devote themselves
wholly to the chase and to warfare. By the first they become rich, by the
second famous. They come to be petty chiefs among their people, not by
the prowess of their fathers, but by their own. To this is added the thought
that in proportion to their achievements they will gain for themselves
happiness in the next life. They have no religion, or very little, the most
noticeable feature of it being the veneration of fire, together with ridiculous superstitions. They are cheerful, affable, and docile in their manner,
compassionate toward the sick, orphans, and widows, respectful to their
elders, generous toward strangers, kind to guests, but in general more
revengeful for injury than grateful for benefits, as is proved by the
atrocities which their prisoners experience at their hands, which are so
great that even to relate them would cause horror and make the narrator a
party to them [Bolton 1914, Volume II:202-204].

In the late summer of 1779, De M6zi~res made his last visit to Central Texas
and its natives. He found the lower Tawakoni village on the Brazos had been
hard hit by the epidemic of 1777-78. But it now counted 250 warriors (in a
probable population of 900), suggesting that some other Tawakoni or Wichitaspeaking group, perhaps the Iscanis, had settled at the village. In a memorandum
of gifts given to its people he identified its chief as Quiscat (Bolton 1914,
Volume II:276-277). This influential leader (also known as Quiscot, Ciscat
Gainor, and Siscat Gaynor) generally attempted to maintain cordial relations
with the Spaniards, and they referred to him as the paramount chief of the
"Yscanis," "Flechasos," and "Taguacanes" (Cabello 1784, 1785). De M6zi~res
also noted that the Tawakonis of the upper village were given the same presents
and that its chief was "Flechazo" (arrow wound). The similarity of this chiefâs
name to that of"E1 Flechado en la Cara" (facial scar from an arrow wound?), the
chief of the Tawakoni village on the Sabine some 19 years earlier, is striking.
The two may well have been the same man.
In the fall of 1786, Pedro Vial, a French frontiersman who had lived among
and was well acquainted with the Taovayas on the Red River, was dispatched by
Domingo Cabello, Governor of Texas, to explore a direct route from San Antonio to Santa Fe. But before he departed from San Antonio his mission was
expanded and the journey lengthened. Some young Taovaya and Wichita proper

Newcomb ~ Historic Indians of Central Texas

41

warriors had raided San Antonio for horses and one of them had been killed. Vial
identified the dead warrior as a Taovaya, and the Frenchman was now to proceed
to the Spanish Fort villages to express Spanish displeasure to the tribal leaders
about this hostile activity. Then he was to go on to Santa Fe. The journey did not
go well. While crossing the Guadalupe on the second day out Vial and his aide,
Cristobal de Los Santos, lost their provisions and a horse drowned. By the time
they reached the Colorado River Vial was sick, and five days later, apparently in
the vicinity of the Lampasas River, he fell unconscious from his horse. When he
regained consciousness two hours later, his companion wanted Vial to sign a
note absolving him from responsibility for his likely death. Vial refused to do so
and decided to go to a Tawakoni village for help. Nine days later, traveling north,
they reached the village, but nobody was there; its occupants apparently had left
for their fall hunt. The next day, six leagues (16 miles) farther north, they reached
the Brazos, and four days later, continuing in the same direction, they reached
"Quiscotâs" village.
The Taovaya and Wichita-proper raiders had passed through the village on
their way home; Quiscat had taken some of their horses and given them a severe
reprimand. He made it clear to Vial that he wanted to maintain peaceful relationship with the Spaniards. Vial told the chief of his illness and asked if someone in
the village would venture to cure him. Quiscat answered in the affirrnative, Vial
settled down in the chiefâs lodge, and seven week later the frontiersman departed
on his journey cured (Vial 1787; Loomis and Nasatir 1967:268-285). Vial did not
visit Flechazoâs village (possibly the Stansbury site?) even though it was on his
route to the Spanish Fort villages. This suggests that it had been abandoned and
perhaps had been relocated at the empty village Vial had visited earlier.
Allusions to the Iscani band that had lived in a scattered settlement east of
the Trinity River in 1772 become increasingly scarce during the remaining years
of the century. The last reference to them appears to have been made in 1799
when their head chief died (Moral 1799; Elam 1971:200). After this date the
Iscanis apparently were absorbed by one or another of the Tawakoni villages,
were simply termed Tawakonis, or lived at some unreported place in the Waco
area. It has long been assumed that the sub-tribe designated as Waco by AngloAmericans refers to these Iscanis, but this is doubtful (Bolton 1910c:1002;
Newcomb 1961:250).
There is also uncertainty about the origin and meaning of the word Waco.
Lesser and Weltfish (1932:12) state that:
wekuâ is said by informants to be derived from wehiko, which latter is
evidently the Wichita rendition of Mexico as pronounced by the Spanish;
it was used for the people of this band because, according to tradition,
they were always fighting with the Mexicans. They are spoken of as
"Indians who were always scouting around."

It is likely, whatever the meaning of the term Waco, that the word was
derived from an early nineteenth century name for a Tawakoni village on the north

42

bank of the Red River in the Spanish Fort locality. Besides this village, Taovaya
and Wichita proper villages were then nearby on the south side of the river. The
principal chief of the three villages was Awakahea (or Awahakei) of the Tawakoni
village. He died in 1811 while returning from a visit to Natchitoches, and the
Taovayas and Wichita proper could not agree on a successor; consequently the
villages were abandoned (Garrett 1946:403; Sibley 1832:54; Bell, Jelks, and
Newcomb 1967:289-301). According to Anthony Glass, an American trader who
visited these villages in 1808-1809, Awakaheaâs north bank village was called
"Huick," or something similar since the only extant copy of this word in Glassâ
diary is nearly illegible (John 1982-83:416). As John (1982-83:434, fn 13) notes,
"This may in fact represent one of the earliest occurrences of the name which
Anglos would render as Waco." When the villages dispersed after the chiefâs
death, the term Huico was employed for part or all of the Tawakonis who moved
south to the Brazos River, and who apparently established a village at the Barron
Branch site in what is now downtown Waco. Nineteenth century Anglo-Americans wrote and pronounced the word in a variety of ways, the modem pronunciation "way-ko" distorting the original "wee-ko."
Watt (1969:208) has located the Barron Branch site more exactly within
Waco:
the village area extended as far west from the river as the Masonic
Temple at 8th street, and from Barron Branch south to the spring in the
bank of the river at Bridge Street. The big spring, "cold as ice" emerged
from the south side of Barron Branch, near the present school building
at 7th and Jefferson. When the branch was walled up and converted
into a controlled channel, the big spring was destroyed. An historical
marker now designates the spot. A smaller spring still flows from the
west bank of the river immediately south of the Suspension Bridge, at
the point where Bridge Street, first Waco main street, was planned to
meet the river.
Following the purchase of the Louisiana Territory by the United States in
1803, a resident of Natchitoches, Louisiana, Dr. John Sibley, was put in charge
of Indian affairs in the neighboring region. He did not visit the Indians in their
villages and camps, but veteran traders supplied him with information about
them, and delegations of Indians soon came to Natchitoches to trade, receive
presents, and talk with him. The Waco migration to the Barron Branch village is
indirectly supported by his reports. In his first communication about Central
Texas Indians in 1805 he reported that "Tawakenoes or Three Canes" lived on
the west bank of the Brazos, "but are often, for months at a time, lower down
than their usual place of residence, in the great plain on the Tortuga or Turtle,
called so, from its being a hill in the prairie" (near the modem namesake town of
Tehuacana, Limestone County, known archeologically as the Vinson site
[Duffield and Jelks 1961:70-72]). Sibley added that they "are estimated at two
hundred men; are good hunters; have guns, but hunt principally with the bow; are

Newcomb m Historic Indians of Central Texas

43

supplied with goods from Nacogdoches, and pay for them in rugs, tongues,
tallow, and skins" (Sibley 1832:723). But in a newspaper article, apparently
published in about 1818-1820, Sibley said that the "Whacoes" with a population
of 350-400, lived on the Brazos, while "Touwackanies" were then living "at a
beautiful spring of water which discharges into the river Trinity from the west
side" (Abel 1922:92-94).
The Wacos first came to the attention of Stephen F. Austinâs colonists in
August 1823 when a war party returning from a raid on the Tonkawas was seen
while camped on the Colorado River near present La Grange (Barker 19241928:682). The following spring a large Waco and Tawakoni war party of 180
men, again in pursuit of Tonkawas, was discovered by settlers near present
Columbus (Barker 1924-1928:755), and it was assumed that they were responsible for killing Captain Tumlinson near present Seguin (Barker 1924-1928:842843). A short time later, a party of 13 Wacos was discovered approaching the
settlements, and Captain John J. Tumlinson, a brother of the slain man, with
"eleven young Texas boys" pursued the Indians and found them camped about 14
miles above Columbus on the Colorado River. They surprised the Wacos and
killed 12 of them (Wilbarger 1889:204-205). Whether or not the Wacos were
guilty was not considered or determined. Thus was inaugurated the kind of
behavior that characterized Texan and Waco-Tawakoni relations for many years-misunderstanding, Indian forays, and settler and ranger pursuit.
Austinâs struggling colony could ill afford conflict with the Tawakonis and
Wacos, and Austin sent commissioners in June 1824 to the Brazos River villages
to "form a lasting treaty of peace and friendship for ever" (Barker 1924-1928:842845). Thomas M. Duke, one of the commissioners, reported that the Waco
village contained 60 houses, and that the inhabitants had about 400 acres of corn,
beans, pumpkins, and melons under cultivation. He estimated they could raise no
more than 100 warriors, suggesting a population of about 400. Most of the
Wacos were away on a buffalo hunt and an expedition against the Osages, but
Duke delivered to those present Austinâs "talk." In it Austin held out the olive
branch of peace on the one hand and threatened dire revenge on the other if those
responsible for killing Tumlinson were not punished. The Wacos "denied positively the murder of Tumlinson and likewise the stealing of any horses." Duke
also mentioned that a Tawakoni village, three miles below the Waco village on
the east side of the Brazos, counted only seven houses (probably the Gas Plant
site; Bell, Jelks, and Newcomb 1967:45-49). At both villages defensive dugouts
had been created by digging shallow pits and throwing the excavated dirt up
around them (De Shields 1912:67; Berlandier 1969:44).
The Mexican government in August 1825 ordered Austin to destroy the
Waco village. Austin procrastinated, but finally, on April 24, 1826, he invited the
intrusive Cherokee Indians of East Texas to join him in a joint campaign against
the Wacos. Although the government rescinded its order, Austin with 190 men
marched up the Brazos in May to find the Tawakoni and Waco villages temporarily deserted (Barker 1924-1928:1317-1323).

44

Texas Archeological Society

Wacos and Tawakonis sporadically continued to raid farms and ranches in
the next few years, primarily seeking horses, and inevitably bringing on retaliatory
forays by Texans (De Shields 1912:47-48, 73; Wilbarger 1889:174-177,208-209,
604; McLean 1979:537, 554-565). In early spring, 1829, for example, Jean Louis
Berlandier, a member of a Mexican boundary commission, accompanied by an
escort of six soldiers, had their horses and mules stolen from under their noses in
an early morning raid by Tawakonis. Berlandierâs party was camped on Salado
Creek, about 10 miles from the San Antonio presidio, and a party of teamsters who
had passed by the previous evening lost their lives, apparently to the same raiders.
A force sent out to recover the livestock was unsuccessful, as was usually the case
after such raids (Berlandier 1980:387-389).
That same spring the Cherokees, apparently with no further encouragement
from Austin, made a determined assault on the Waco village and allegedly killed
55 of its inhabitants. But they failed to take the village since the Wacos were
protected by their redoubts and Tawakoni reinforcements arrived (De Shields
1912:70-73; Wilbarger 1889:174-177; Watt 1969:217-219).
In the summer of 1830, 120 Cherokees attacked the Tawakoni village at
present Tehuacana, and it was reported that they overwhelmed the village, only a
few of its women and children surviving (De Shields 1912:177-179; Wilbarger
1889:177-179; Watt 1969:219-222; see also Gregory and Strickland 1967:64-65).
But this is doubtful, since Tawakonis continued to inhabit this village at least
sporadically until 1835. That summer Captain R. M. Coleman, under cover of
darkness, attempted to infiltrate the village in a surprise attack. His force of 18
men was discovered, however, and in the ensuing fight three of his men were
seriously wounded and one killed. He retreated to Parkerâs Fort near modem
Groesbeck and sent for reinforcements. His messengers encountered Colonel John
Henry Moore, who was already on his way to attack the village with three
companies of volunteers. The combined force assaulted the village to find it
deserted, save for two men and several women and children. The men were killed,
and the women and children taken captive and sold into slavery (Wilbarger
1889:135; De Shields 1912:218-219; Erath 1923:278-279, and Jenkins 1958:23
contain somewhat different Versions of this conflict). The Tawakonis do not seem
to have returned to this village.
The Waco village on Barronâs Branch also had been abandoned prior to 1837
when Fort Fisher, a temporary Texas Ranger post, was established there. It was
spring and the rangers found peach trees in bloom and bison in "possession" of the
village. Old cornstalks stood in the untilled fields and only some of the old
defensive earthworks were still standing (Watt 1969:224).
About the same time that the Wacos abandoned their village, one of the
most publicized and strangest assaults on Anglo-American settlers in Texas was
made on Parkerâs Fort. In 1834, two brothers, James W. and Silas M. Parker
with their families and several other families had settled near the head of the
Navasota River some 70 miles east of Waco. In May 1836, their fort (several

Newcomb ~ Historic Indians of Central Texas

45

cabins surrounded by a stockade) was attacked by a mixed party of northern
Comanches and Kiowas. Five people, including Silas and his father were killed.
Two of Silasâs children, Cynthia Ann, aged 9, and her six-year old brother John,
along with Mrs. Rachel Plummer, her infant son James Platt Plummer, and Mrs.
Elizabeth Kellogg were taken captive. Elizabeth Kellogg, Rachel Plummer, John
Parker, and James Pratt Plummer were all released or ransomed through the
efforts of Delaware Indians and other intermediaries. Cynthia Ann Parker grew
up among the Comanches, however, married a Comanche warrior, and was the
mother of Quanah who became a noted chief. In 1839, Rachel Plummerâs narrative of captivity was published, thus publicizing the raid and establishing in
many minds the barbarism and perfidy of Indians. Actually, James W. Parker
was subsequently accused, though not convicted, of having stolen horses in
company with Indians, only to cheat them out of the proceeds. This accusation
along with the fact that northern Comanches and Kiowas had seldom if ever,
before or after 1836, made forays into this region suggests that the attack was
motivated by revenge on a scoundrel (Plummer 1926; Richardson 1933:90; De
Shields 1912:173-186; Newcomb 1961:344-345, 1978:36).
The departure of the Wacos and Tawakonis from their villages marked the
end of the ancient Indian occupation of Central Texas. For a few more years,
however, the area served as a focal point for negotiations between the dispossessed and their conquerors (For the subsequent history of the Waco and other
Wichita peoples see Elam 1971; Newcomb 1961, 1976).
The Tehuacana Creek Council Grounds
Early in 1843, soon after a trading station had been authorized by the
Republic, Torrey and Brothers established a trading post on the bluff overlooking
what is now known as Tradinghouse Creek, a tributary of Tehuacana Creek
(which of course is an alternate spelling of Tawakoni), approximately eight miles
southeast of Waco. This locale was chosen because it was easily accessible from
the white settlements lower down on the Brazos; it was still without white
settlement so that Indians felt relatively secure when coming in to parley; there
was ample pasturage for horses; and bison still frequented the region. The trading
"house," which was at lânâst a tent or tents rather than a permanent building, was
apparently opened for business in time for a gathering of Indians that spring
assembled at the behest of President Sam Houston. The council between the
commissioners of the Republic and the various Indians who had been persuaded to
attend was held about four miles away from the trading house in the lowlands
closer to the Brazos. In the spring of 1844, the new Superintendent of Indian
Affairs, Thomas G. Western, visited the site and described the bluff overlooking
the council grounds as "a delightful spot." He added that "Mr Sloat is actively
engaged in erecting the necessary buildings for Council house, etc." and a few
days later noted that Sloat had "finished the Council house a building 32 by 20 ft"
(Winfrey 1959-1960, Volume II: 17, 19).

46

Texas Archeological Society

Five major councils were convened at the "treaty grounds" between 1843
and 1846, and small groups of Indians bent on trade and talk made it an active
center for a few years C~Vebb 1952, Volume I: 149-163, Volume II:790-791). The
need for treaty grounds was prompted by Houston who, when he was again elected
in 1841 to the presidency of the Republic, reversed Mirabeau Lamarâs expensive
anti-Indian policy. There was no money to prosecute an Indian war, and Lamarâs
policies had not succeeded in exterminating or evicting the Republicâs natives
(except for the intrusive Cherokees). Even formerly friendly Indians had been
alienated, and the Comanches, after their massacre at the San Antonio council
house in 1840, were unwilling to risk any kind of negotiations with Texans. Out of
necessity, inclination, and perhaps his own political ambitions, Houston pursued a
peaceful and humane Indian policy (Newcomb 1961:350, 1978: 38-39; Gregory
and Strickland 1967:137ff).
Houston quickly employed a group of Indians, primarily Delawares, but also
including such men as Jesse Chisholm (a part Cherokee who was related to
Houstonâs former wife), Luis Sanchez, a Mexican Indian, and others to contact the
resentful, suspicious, and hostile tribes and persuade them to meet in council with
Texans and peacefully work out their differences. Jim Shaw, John Conner, Jim
Sagundai and the other Delawares Houston employed had long carried on extensive trading operations with Comanches and other Plains Indians. More importantly, they were respected and trusted by these tribes and by Americans, they
spoke more or less intelligible English, and they were superbly qualified to serve
as guides, interpreters, and mediators (Newcomb 1978:40-41, n.d).
Despite Houstonâs determination to make his conciliatory Indian policy
work, it was not until the last days of March 1843 that some of the smaller and
friendlier bands of Indians--a band of Delawares and a band of Shawnees who
earlier had settled near the Cherokees in East Texas, and some of the native
Caddos---could be coaxed into their first assembly at the Tehuacana Creek council
grounds. Tawakonis, Wacos, Kichais, and the Wichita proper had also agreed to
attend the council. But while they were on their way to the council grounds they
were joined by some Kichai warriors who had fresh scalps of three white men they
had killed on the Trinity River. They stopped, discussed the matter, and after a
Caddo passed along the rumor that the presents to be distributed had been infected
with smallpox, they decided not to attend. But Shaw, Sagundai, Sanchez, and
Chisholm arrived at the council grounds a week or so later with about 40 Indians,
mostly Caddos, but also including a minor Waco chief, Acaquash (Winfrey 19591960, Volume I:149-163).
Pierce M. Butler, United States Indian agent for the Cherokees, with an
escort of 15 men, also attended the council. His presence was an added inducement to attract reluctant Indians to the council since they had more confidence
in the friendship and integrity of federal agents than in Texans. Included in
Butlerâs entourage was John Mix Stanley, an artist who painted the council
grounds and the leading Indians; his lively account which supplements the
councilâs somewhat self-serving documents, was published in a newspaper.

Newcomb ~ Historic Indians of Central Texas

47

Stanley (1843) had some difficulty in getting the Indians to pose for him, but he
quickly resolved the problem:
I commenced painting the portraits of the head Chiefs--but I was first
subjected to their caprice and superstition, and in order to show you
how exceedingly superstitious they are, I will relate the conditions on
which they consented to set. They said I must first paint "Sanches, Jim
Shaw, a Delaware, and Jess Chism, a Cherokee," under whose protection they were conducted into the Texian Council. If they would consent to sit, and no hurt came to them, then they would sit. This was
whipping the D[evil] around the stump, but there was no alternative,
and I complied with apparent willingness to their wishes. After painting the above named subjects, which gave them great satisfaction, they
all came forward in order according to rank, and were delighted with
the idea of being painted, considering it a great honor.
The council was a failure in that the still powerful Comanches were not
represented, and the designation in the treaty of Acaquash as Chief of the
Tawakonis, Wacos, Wichitas, and Kichais was spurious. He was not even authorized to represent the Wacos (Winfrey 1959-1960, Volume I:153-155).
No Comanches were persuaded to come to the council held in the spring of
1844 either, but the efforts of Houstonâs Delawares and his other agents bore
fruit that fall. Virtually all of the indigenous and immigrant tribes were in
attendance at the council, but there was one stumbling block to mutual accord.
Buffalo Hump, a leading war chief of the Penateka (or Southern) Comanches
approved the treaty prepared by the Texans except for the location of a boundary
line to be drawn between Texan and Indian country. Both Houston and the
Comanche were adamant, and the articles that dealt with the boundary had to be
struck from the treaty C~Â¢infrey 1959-1960, Volume II:112). From the point of
view of the Texans the council was a success in that most of the Republicâs
Indians, including the majority of the recalcitrant Southern Comanches, had
agreed to peace.
In the fall of 1845, the Wichita proper finally joined the other Wichitaspeaking tribes in signing a peace treaty with Texas. A few days after the
Wichitas had left the Tehuacana Creek council grounds, news was received that
Comanches under Old Owl and Santa Anna were on their way in to trade and
talk. This was the first time that Santa Anna, an influential and well-known war
chief, and his eleven captains had come to parley. Agents L. H. Williams and F.
E. Eldredge rode out to greet them and escort them to the almost deserted council
grounds. It was a tense meeting; there was little trading and the Comanches were
fully armed. Jim Shaw, the Delaware interpreter, chided them for this breach of
etiquette, and the Comanches responded rather lamely. They obviously did not
intend to be victims of another massacre. Before the traditional pipe had been
smoked, an old chief, apparently Old Owl, rose to address the Comanche warriors insisting that peace must be preserved. After the pipe had been smoked,

48

Agent Williams made a conciliatory speech, noting that presents would be
distributed at the close of the council. Finally Santa Anna spoke, stating that he
agreed with Old Owl, and that the other great chiefs had urged him to come and
see the Texans and talk with them. Now that he had done so, he said he would
abide by the armistice the other Comanche chiefs had accepted; he would be at
peace. It was the last council the Republic of Texas had with its Indians, since in
a few weeks Texas was annexed to the United States. But it was not the last
council held at the Tehuacana Creek council grounds (Winfrey 1959-1960,
Volume II:399ff).
In September 1845, with annexation in the offing and hostilities with
Mexico probable, Pierce M. Butler and M. G. Lewis were directed by the United
States Commissioner of Indian Affairs to meet with the Texas tribes and establish a peaceful relationship with them. They planned to meet with the Indians at
Comanche Peak, in present Hood County, but by the time their expedition found
the hill and also contacted the scattered Indians it was February. The Comanches
were not willing to hold a talk at the peak (more accurately a "butte"), and they
dictated a meeting at the trading house on the Brazos early in May. The Texas
tribes began drifting in to the council grounds in April, and ultimately most of
them signed the elaborate treaty of !4 articles. It brought most of the Texas
Indians under obligations to the government and secured an exposed flank while
the nation was preoccupied with the Mexican War. For Central Texas it signaled the end of an era, for the frontier quickly moved beyond it. For most of
the Indians it was an admission, perhaps only dimly comprehended, of impending subjugation and dominance by the United States (Kappler 1904, Volume
II:554-557; Winfrey 1959-1960, Volume II:43-61; Foreman 1948). The feeling
had been eloquently expressed, though with naive optimism, by Acaquash at
the Tehuacana Creek council grounds in the spring of 1843:
The soil I now stand upon was once mine, it is now the land of the
Texians and my home is far off in the West. Here in my young days I
hunted the Buffalo and Red Deer and lived in peace and was friends
with all man kind, till the white men of Texas come and drove me from
the home of my youth. Once more I am here in this Council to treat for
peace, I speak truth, I wish for peace and a peace which shall be lasting
as long as the sun rises and sets and the rivers in their channels to run.
The wild fire of war has swept oâer the land and enveloped my home
and people in smoke, but when I return to them and tell them what I
have heard, the smoke will be dispelled and they can find their way to
the Council ground of our White brothers of Texas, and all combine to
quench this fire that heats our blood and impells us on to war. It made
my heart glad to hear my Texas friends say that land and country
should be given to the Red Men for homes, and that liberty should be
granted them to hunt the wild game in their forests [Stanley 1843].

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
It is likely that documentary records will never reveal very much about the
aboriginal inhabitants of Central Texas. Nonetheless, the frustrations of the
ethnohistorian are relieved to some extent by the inferences that can be drawn
from the scant data. Apparently, for example, such natives or presumed natives
as the Cantonas, Sanas, Quichuans, and others were hunters and gatherers who
lived off the bounty of the areaâs rather rich and varied environment. This wild
food subsistence base is supported by what is known about the Late Prehistoric
(Neoarchaic) archeological complexes of the region (Prewitt 1981:68). Corn
cobs are occasionally found in Neoarchaic sites, but they seem to have been
imported, probably from Caddoan peoples to the east or Kichai or Wichita
speakers to the north. If some local natives did grow corn or other crops, it is
likely they only supplemented a wild food regimen. That migrant Wichitaspeakers were able to establish productive gardens in the area in the eighteenth
century suggests that population pressure had not led horticulturists to expand
into the area, and/or its native hunter-gatherers had an ancient, deeply ingrained,
relatively secure subsistence such that there was little or insufficient impetus for
them to become gardeners.
Chief among the game animals of Central Texas in desirability but not
likely preponderant in terms of annual total subsistence was the bison. The
region is on the southern margins of their range; bison were usually present in the
winter months, particularly on the Blackland Prairies, but in the summer months
they moved northward leaving few or no animals in the area. This generalization
is flawed to the extent that the movements of bison from season to season and
year to year were so erratic that in some years they may have been virtually
absent, in others present in tremendous numbers with some animals remaining
throughout the year.
The habits of bison also suggest that local hunters probably followed the
seasonal movements of the herds considerable distances, constrained by their
ability to keep up with them and by their relationships with the neighboring
peoples they encountered. In years when bison were plentiful no doubt the region
also acted as a magnet, attracting peoples from less favored areas. It may be
inferred, then, that natives of Central Texas, like the bison-hunting Apaches
encountered by Ofiate on the High Plains, were not strangers to numerous
contacts and probable conflicts with their neighbors. Archeological evidence
supports such foreign contacts in that imported Caddoan ceramics are found in
local Neoarchaic sites and arrowpoints often found in burials seem not to be
funeral offerings, but indicative of the reasons for the individualâs demise (Prewitt
1981:83-84). The widespread use of sign language by the historic tribes of the
region also suggests that the mingling of natives speaking different languages
was an old occurrence.
The most efficient way to hunt bison was communally, and there is a good
probability that when bison were numerous, dispersed nuclear family and

50

extended family groups joined forces to impound, surround, or use other
techniques to take far more bison than could be secured by lone hunters. There
are, however, no known "jump" sites or other indications of large scale kill sites
in Central Texas. The optimum number of hunters for communal hunts is
unknown, but it was probably larger than the bands of their prehorse Apache
peers (up to about 100 persons), depending upon a variety of factors such as the
number of warriors needed to provide security. It is also likely that leadership
was needed for communal hunts, no doubt which was provided by experienced
or proven hunters. Almost surely, when hunting was productive, surplus meat
was dried or smoked for later use, and perhaps dried meat and hides were used
for trading purposes.
When bison were scarce or absent (normally by mid-summer to early winter), native groups must have dispersed into small family or other kin groups to
exploit local resources. Deer, bear, and smaller mammals were present and
perhaps abundant as were a variety of birds and other animals. Wild plant foods
from pecans and other nuts to berries, seeds, roots, and tubers were probably
utilized seasonally as well and may have supplied the bulk of the natives food in
times of bison scarcity.
That there were years and perhaps occasionally a succession of years when
bison were scarce or absent meant that the native population was limited by the
lean years, not by the bountiful ones. Even when bison blackened its prairies and
surplus meat could be dried or smoked for later consumption, it could be stored for
only several months. In short, despite the incredible numbers of bison that were
sometimes present in Central Texas, they were not the primary factor in regulating
the size of its human population; critical was the regular availability of a diversity
of wild plant and animal foods.
Assuming the general accuracy of this subsistence appraisal, it is evident
that the natives of Central Texas come under the rubric of "band level" cultures
in terms of socio-political integration (Service 1971). But it would be a mistake
to equate them with band level societies situated in less bountiful, more restrictive, or harsher environments such as deserts or the High Plains. Unfortunately,
there appear to be no well-described contemporary groups who inhabited roughly
similar environments and who were subject to like conditions. The erratic habits of bison, for example, probably did not confer an advantage on hunters who
were intimately acquainted with local areas. Thus, there would have been no
particular advantage for a man to remain in the locality of his birth after marriage (patrilocality) because of his extensive knowledge of its terrain and the
habits of its wildlife. This may well explain the matrilocal emphasis of Apaches
as well as that of some of the peoples who came to constitute the Tonkawa tribe.
The frequent patrilocality of band level people is also said to be a response to
conflict and feuding between related, intermarrying bands, since matrilocality
might result in pitting brother against brother. But in this region, apparently characterized by the coming and going of unrelated peoples, this factor was apparently inoperable.

Newcomb ~ Historic Indians of Central Texas

It might be argued that large "enhanced" bands (perhaps several hundred
people), hypothesized for the prehorse natives of Central Texas during the bison-hunting season, should more properly be designated as "tribes." But that
they possessed the integrating mechanisms of tribes, such as clans, warrior societies, or other voluntary associations which would have served to make these
groups more cohesive and structured socially and politically is unlikely. If such
tribes had existed their sense of ethnicity probably would have been greater and
historically more persistent, and their ability to repulse refugee or remnant
peoples, and especially to offer more effective resistance to Apache raiders,
would have been more evident. But there is no hint that this was the case; instead the regionâs natives seem to have been characterized by a number (possibly a considerable number) of local, kin-related, politically unstructured
entities.
When Europeans became acquainted with Central Texas in the early decades of the eighteenth century, it already had become a haven for displaced
and fragmented native groups, driven northward by the advance of the Spanish
colonial frontier and harried eastward by the explosion of mounted Apache
warriors. Diseases, introduced by Europeans, probably had spread already to
the region, depleting local populations. Horses also had been acquired by the
opening of the century, but that all local groups had an abundant or even adequate supply and had learned or devised the most effective ways to utilize them
is doubtful. Mounted men were of course more productive hunters and could
range farther afield, and they were better able to defend themselves against
enemies. But the adoption of horses was not an unmixed blessing. Adequate
pasturage for their animals added a new factor affecting the permanence and
location of camps. And the more horses a group had, the more attractive targets
they became for others eager to acquire more horses. Apache attacks forced local
groups to join forces and camp together, at least during the bison-hunting season and perhaps habitually. If the Cantonas, Tusonibis, and the Indians of
Rancherfa Grande were characteristic of these alliances, such groups apparently
numbered about 2,000 persons. This may have represented an optimum number-large enough to discourage Apache assaults, yet not so large as to require
constant movement to find adequate pasturage or game.
Several factors appear to have been involved in what must have been devastating Apache raids into Central Texas in the last decades of the seventeenth
century and on into the following century. By the early years of the eighteenth
century, the easternmost Apaches, who became collectively known as Lipans,
had about 75 years to perfect their martial skills as mounted warriors and to
acquire an ample supply of horses. In the 1760s, they were subdivided into at
least 12 bands, each averaging about 400 persons, several of which sometimes
joined forces for raiding and hunting (Tunnell and Newcomb 1969:150-151).
Assuming such bands existed 40-50 years earlier, it is obvious why they were
able to terrorize Central Texas, particularly when they fell on dispersed, poorly
mounted native or refugee groups.

A variety of forces, then, had a continuing, long-term impact on the native
and refugee Indians of Central Texas. The most impressive, although seldom
noted consequence of population decline, population movements, and the introduction of European cultural elements, particularly the horse complex and firearms, was the continuing amalgamation and consolidation of its peoples. It began
at least as early as the last decades of the seventeenth century and continued
among the survivors into the nineteenth century. Survival forced indigenous and
intrusive groups to merge, and as they in turn declined the process was repeated.
Its surprising feature was that consolidated groups were in some cases drawn from
such varied linguistic, geographic, and cultural backgrounds. The most clear-cut
case is that of the peoples who came to comprise the Tonkawa tribe. But even the
groups that became the Wichita tribe in the nineteenth century also probably had
incorporated some alien, non-Caddoan speaking elements.
During the last half of the eighteenth century, Apache dominance of Central
Texas waned and the Wichita tribes gained ascendancy. But the Wichita tribes had
neither the numbers, cohesion, or the political and economic ties with Europeans
that would ensure their predominance. And by the time Anglo-Americans began
to settle the area the Wichita had neither the numbers, military strength, or
political acumen to contest the invasion and usurpation of their lands. The Wacos
may have been the most adept horse thieves on the Texas frontier, as is often
alleged, but if such talents had any impact on their fortunes it was to hasten their
departure from the region.
The story of the Indians of Central Texas is, then, a complex one, a tale of a
land long inhabited by a shifting assortment of people. Ill-equipped to withstand
the direct and indirect impact of the Euro-American assault, they were felled by
introduced diseases and warfare, seduced by the attractiveness of foreign
possessions and much changed as a consequence. Most ultimately disappeared in
a cultural sense, the few surviving tribes being but a faded vestige of their
forerunners.

enthusiasm have been enlightening, stimulating, and encouraging. Campbellâs
prodigious labors in ferreting out information, and our numerous conversations
through the years about Texas Indians have added immeasurably to my comprehension of them. It would not be far off the mark to list him as co-author of this
