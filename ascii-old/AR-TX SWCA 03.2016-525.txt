ABSTRACT
On behalf of Harris County Precinct 4 (HCP4), SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) has conducted
an intensive archaeological survey of the proposed Spring Creek Greenway Trail, Phase V. The proposed
hike and bike trail will be constructed in four sections, A-D (totaling approximately 7.7 miles,
approximately 93 acres), on lands owned by Harris County and under the control of HCP4, as well as
privately-owned land. The sections connect to portions of the trail previously constructed. The project area
is located on the south side of Spring Creek west of Interstate 45 in northern Harris County, Texas.
Archaeological investigations were conducted pursuant to the acquisition of a USACE Section 404 permit
in accordance with 33 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 325, Appendix C (Processing Department
of Army Permits: Procedures for the Protection of Historic Properties; Final Rule 1990; with current Interim
Guidance Documents dated April 25, 2005 and January 31, 2007); and Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) (16 United States Code [USC] 470) and its implementing regulations 36 CFR
800. As the portions of the project area are owned by a political subdivision of the State of Texas, work
was additionally conducted in compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas Natural Resource
Code, Title 9, Chapter 191) and accompanying Rules of Practice and Procedure (Texas Administrative
Code, Title 13, Chapter 26) under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7791.
The background review identified a number of surveys within 1 mile of the project area, 11 of which
intersect or are located immediately adjacent to (within 100 feet) of the current project area. The southern
one-third of Section C within the D.R. Horton tract was previously surveyed. Additionally, the easternmost portion of Section A is along existing developed trail. No additional survey was completed in these
two areas.
During the current investigation, SWCA identified or revisited eight cultural resources within or
immediately adjacent to the proposed project area. This includes five archaeological sites (41HR625,
41HR981, 41HR1098, 41HR1099, 41HR1140), two isolated finds (Isolated Find 1 and Isolated Find 2),
and one historic cemetery (Bogs-Hufsmith Cemetery).
Sites 41HR625, 41HR981, and 41HR1098 are previously recorded prehistoric sites which were previously
recommended or determined NOT ELIGIBLE for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or for
State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) status. SWCA found no evidence at these sites to suggest an alternate
recommendation and no further work is recommended at these sites.
Site 41HR1099 is a previously identified prehistoric site. During the current investigation, no cultural
materials were identified on the surface or subsurface of site 41HR1099 within the project area. As such,
NRHP and SAL eligibility for site 41HR1099 remains UNDETERMINED; however, SWCA recommends
a finding that the proposed project will have NO ADVERSE EFFECT and no further work is recommended
at this time.
Site 41HR1140 is a previously recorded prehistoric occupation site dating to the Late Archaic to Late
Prehistoric periods. The site has been investigated by the current project and previous survey, testing, and
data recovery by HRA Gray & Pape. The site was previously determined ELIGIBLE for the NRHP. The
subsequent data recovery at the site by HRA Gray & Pape determined that the investigated areas of the site
did not contain intact living surfaces. The current investigation identified three loci of artifact
concentrations within the project area. These concentrations showed limited evidence of occupation and
lacked contextual integrity. As such, SWCA recommends a finding that the current project will have NO
ADVERSE EFFECT at site 41HR1140.

Isolated Find 1 is a single prehistoric chert flake and Isolated Find 2 is a concrete pad possibly associated
with agricultural or industrial activities in the late 1970s/1980s. Both were found insufficient to be
considered as sites and trinomials will not be requested. Isolated Find 1 and Isolated Find 2 are
recommended NOT ELIGIBLE for the NRHP or SAL and no further work is recommended.
The Bogs-Hufsmith Cemetery is an historic cemetery with at least 168 interments dating from 1911 to
present. NRHP and SAL eligibility for the Bogs-Hufsmith Cemetery is UNDETERMINED, as further
archival work would be necessary to assess the cemeteryâs potential to contribute to the understanding of
local or regional history. SWCA recommends surface scraping outside the cemetery area to ensure that no
unmarked graves extend into the proposed construction workspace. An easement in this area is currently
being transferred to Harris County; therefore, this work cannot be completed at this time. Once available,
the surface scraping will be conducted under SWCA oversight to ensure avoidance of the cemetery and will
be reported in an addendum to this report prior to trail construction.
In accordance with Section 106 of the NHPA 36 CFR 800.4 (b)(1) and the Antiquities Code of Texas,
SWCA has made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify significant cultural resources within the
project area. Properties listed or otherwise eligible for the NRHP, or for designation as a SAL, were
identified within the project area. With the exception of the pending further investigation of the BogsHufsmith Cemetery, SWCA recommends a finding that the current project will have NO ADVERSE
EFFECT on any significant portions of these sites under 36 CFR 800.5(b).

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
Project Title. Intensive Archaeological Survey of the Proposed Spring Creek Greenway Trail, Phase V,
Harris County, Texas
SWCA Project Number. 39879
Project Description. On behalf of Harris County Precinct 4 (HCP4) proposes to construct the Spring
Creek Greenway, Phase V hike and bike trail in four sections, A-D (totaling approximately 7.7 miles), on
lands owned by Harris County and under the control of HCP4, as well as privately-owned land. The sections
connect to portions designed or constructed by other projects. The project area is located on the south side
of Spring Creek west of Interstate 45 in northern Harris County, Texas. The present investigation included
a background review and an intensive pedestrian survey augmented with shovel and auger testing in order
to systematically identify, record, delineate, and if possible, determine the significance of any cultural
resources identified within the project area.
Number of Acres Surveyed. 93 acres (100-foot-wide corridor approximately 7.7 miles in length)
Principal Investigator. Todd L. Butler
Dates of Work: September 27 through October 5, 2016
Purpose of Work: Archaeological investigations were conducted pursuant to the acquisition of a USACE
Section 404 permit in accordance with 33 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 325, Appendix C
(Processing Department of Army Permits: Procedures for the Protection of Historic Properties; Final Rule
1990; with current Interim Guidance Documents dated April 25, 2005 and January 31, 2007); and Section
106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) (16 United States Code [USC] 470) and its
implementing regulations 36 CFR 800. As the portions of the project area are owned by a political
subdivision of the State of Texas, work was additionally conducted in compliance with the Antiquities Code
of Texas (Texas Natural Resource Code, Title 9, Chapter 191) and accompanying Rules of Practice and
Procedure (Texas Administrative Code, Title 13, Chapter 26) under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7791.
Number of Sites. During the current investigation, SWCA identified or revisited eight cultural resources
within or immediately adjacent to the proposed project area. This includes five archaeological sites
(41HR625, 41HR981, 41HR1098, 41HR1099, 41HR1140), two isolated finds (Isolated Find 1 and Isolated
Find 2), and one historic cemetery (Bogs-Hufsmith Cemetery).
Eligibility. Sites 41HR625, 41HR981, and 41HR1098 are previously recorded prehistoric sites that had
been recommended or determined NOT ELIGIBLE for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or
State Antiquities Landmark (SAL). SWCA found no evidence at these sites to suggest an alternate
recommendation and no further work is recommended at these sites.
Site 41HR1099 is a previously identified prehistoric site. During the current investigation, no cultural
materials were identified on the surface or subsurface of site 41HR1099 within the project area. As such,
NRHP and SAL eligibility for site 41HR1099 remains UNDETERMINED; however, SWCA recommends
a finding that the proposed project will have NO ADVERSE EFFECT and no further work is recommended
at this time.

INTRODUCTION
On behalf of Harris County Precinct 4 (HCP4), SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) has conducted
an intensive archaeological survey of the proposed Spring Creek Greenway Trail Phase V (âprojectâ). The
proposed trail will be constructed in four sections totaling approximately 7.7 miles, approximately 93 acres
(âproject areaâ) located on the south side of Spring Creek west of Interstate 45 in northern Harris County,
Texas.
Archaeological investigations were conducted pursuant to the acquisition of a USACE Section 404 permit
in accordance with 33 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 325, Appendix C (Processing Department
of Army Permits: Procedures for the Protection of Historic Properties; Final Rule 1990; with current Interim
Guidance Documents dated April 25, 2005 and January 31, 2007); and Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) (16 United States Code [USC] 470) and its implementing regulations 36 CFR
800. As the portions of the project area are owned by a political subdivision of the State of Texas, work
was additionally conducted in compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas Natural Resource
Code, Title 9, Chapter 191) and accompanying Rules of Practice and Procedure (Texas Administrative
Code, Title 13, Chapter 26) under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7791.
A background research and literature review was completed for the project and surrounding area.
Additionally, SWCA archaeologists conducted an intensive archaeological survey of the planned area of
effect of the project area. The background review revealed that the southern one-third of Section C within
the D.R. Horton tract was previously surveyed and the eastern-most portion of Section A is along existing
developed trail. No additional survey was completed in these two areas.
Todd L. Butler served as Principal Investigator and Project Manager for the project. The report was prepared
by Susan E. Butler. Todd McLeod and Jordan Daem conducted the field survey. Geographic information
systems (GIS) support was provided and report graphics were prepared by GIS Specialists Lolita Guarin
and Colleen Kennedy. The report was edited by Joy Hengst. A special thank you to Jim Hughey and Tony
Scott at HRA Gray & Pape for providing SWCA with copies of the Phase I & II and Phase III reports, in
addition to the shapefiles from their investigations at site 41HR1140.

Project Area Description
The proposed hike and bike trail will be constructed in four sections, A-D (totaling approximately 7.7
miles), on lands owned by Harris County and under the control of Harris County Precinct 4, as well as
privately-owned land. The proposed sections connect to previously constructed trail segments.
Sections A, B, and C connect to each other and begin approximately 0.93 mile southeast of the intersection
of Springwoods Village Parkway and Energy Drive, ending just east of the intersection of Gosling Road
and Creekside Forest Drive (approximately 6.0 miles total). Section D begins within Ray Campbell
Burrough Park and ends east of the intersection of Farm-to-Market (FM) 2978 and Stanolind Road
(approximately 1.7 miles). The project sections are illustrated on the Spring, Tamina, and Oklahoma, Texas,
U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute topographic maps (Figure 1).
The proposed hike and bike trail will be constructed within a 12- to 14-foot-wide corridor. To accommodate
potential shifts in the proposed trail alignment, a 100-foot-wide corridor was surveyed. The anticipated
depth of impacts will be from 1 to 2 feet.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Physiographic Region
The project area is located in northern Harris County on the edge of two ecotones, the coastal plains of the
Northern Humid Gulf Coastal Prairies to the south, and the Flatwoods ecotone to the north (Griffith et al.
2007). The Northern Humid Coastal Prairies are gently sloping and relatively flat. Soils are typically wet
because of poor drainage that results from clay subsoils and low relief. The Flatwoods are acidic, clayey,
and generally wet. The proposed hike and bike trail is within the San Jacinto River basin, on the south side
of Spring Creek. Unnamed tributaries to Spring Creek traverse the project area at several locations.

Geology
Geologically, the project area is located on Quaternary Alluvium and the Lissie Formation. Alluvium
consists of clay, silt, and sand, with locally abundant organic matter. It includes point bar, natural levee,
stream channel, and backswamp deposits (Barnes 1982). The Pleistocene Lissie formation contains clay,
silt, sand, and a very minor amount of small siliceous gravels. It is locally calcareous, with concretions of
calcium carbonate, iron oxide, and iron-manganese oxides. The surface is fairly flat and featureless except
for numerous rounded shallow depressions and pimple mounds (Barnes 1982).

Houston-PALM
According to Abbottâs (2001) Houston-PALM, a guide to archaeological potential related to
geomorphology in the Harris County area, the majority of the project area is located in Map Unit 1, with a
few areas within Map Unit 2. Briefly, Map Unit 1 is characteristic of areas underlain by deep Holocene
deposits that exhibit low to moderate surficial disturbance (Abbott 2001:156). Surface survey with shovel
testing and deep testing, if deep impacts are anticipated, is recommended in Map Unit 1. Map Unit 2 is
characterized by Holocene-age, alluvial, eolian, or colluvial veneer deposits that exhibit low to moderate
evidence of disturbance and rest on Pleistocene landforms (Abbott 2001:156). Surface survey with shovel
testing is recommended in Map Unit 2.

Soils
According to the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Web Soil Survey (NRCS 2016), soils
in the area consist of Pleistocene age terrace deposits on upland segments, and sandy and loamy alluvium
in areas adjacent to Spring Creek and its tributaries. The five soil map units within the proposed project
area include: Segno fine sandy loam (1 to 3 percent slopes), Hatliff-Pluck-Kian (0 to 1 percent slopes,
frequently flooded), Sorter silt loam (0 to 1 percent slopes), Kenney loamy fine sand (0 to 2 percent slopes),
and Boy loamy fine sand (1-5 percent slopes). Individual soil series within the proposed project area are
presented in Table 1.

Flora and Fauna
The modern vegetation communities differ slightly from past biotic communities (Griffith et al. 2007).
Vegetation in the area once consisted of piney forests dominated by longleaf pine (Pinus palustris)
intermixed with white oak (Quercus alba), southern red oak (Quercus falcata), willow oak (Quercus
phellos), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), and hollies (Ilex spp.) (Griffith
et al. 2007:92). Pine wetlands included sweetbay (Magnolia virginiana) and wax myrtle (Morella cerifera).
Today, the Flatwoods ecological province is dominated by loblolly (Pinus taeda) and shortleaf (Pinus
echinata) pine plantations.
The project area is located in the southern Austroriparian biotic as defined by Blair (1950). The western
border of the Austroriparian biotic province is largely based on the expansion of the pine and hardwood
forest. As such, the expansion of this timber and the Austroriparian province fluctuates with the amount of
rainfall (Blair 1950).
The province has a high faunal diversity. Blair (1950) identified at least 47 species of mammals, 41 species
of reptiles, and 35 species of amphibians native to the region. Blair (1950) defines the following mammals
as common within the Austroriparian province: white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), muskrat
(Ondatra zibethicus), raccoon (Procyon lotor), coyote (Canis latrans), opossum (Didelphis virginiana),
eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus), eastern pipistrelle bat (Pipistrellus subflavus), red bat (Lasiurus

CULTURAL SETTING
The project area is located within the Southeast Texas archaeological region (Perttula 2004a). Southeast
Texas is identified to include the upper Texas coast, from the Sabine River southwestward to the Brazos
River delta, and including the adjacent inland coastal plain (Ricklis 2004).

Prehistoric Cultural Setting
The prehistoric cultural setting is divided into three primary periods: Paleoindian, Archaic, and Ceramic.
The Protohistoric period bridges the gap to the historic period, with the arrival of Europeans to Southeast
Texas. The following summary draws heavily from regional sources found in The Prehistory of Texas
(Perttula 2004b) and a comprehensive regional summary provided by Story (1990) in The Archaeology and
Bioarchaeology of the Gulf Coastal Plain.

Paleoindian Period
In Southeast Texas, the Paleoindian period (ca. 11,500-8000 years before present [B.P.]) is divided into
Early (ca. 11,500-10,000 B.P.) and Late (10,000-8500 B.P.) subperiods (Perttula 2004a:9). Fluted points are
the most commonly known markers of the Paleoindian period. Early types include Clovis and Folsom
points. Late Paleoindian occupation is generally represented by Dalton, San Patrice, and Scottsbluff, in
addition to Plainview and Angostura points (Bousman et al. 2004; Ricklis 2004; Turner et al. 2011).
Few Paleoindian sites have been identified, and of those, none have been systematically excavated in
Southeast Texas. Paleoindian projectile points have been primarily identified by surface collections in the
region, and only about two dozen Paleoindian sites have been recorded in Harris County (Bousman et al.
2004:64). Paleoindian points have been found in excavated contexts, although these have generally been
mixed with materials from later periods. Most have been identified along major stream drainages (Ricklis
2004). It is thought that one factor in the lack of intact Paleoindian sites is due to the submersion of coastal
occupations by an increase in sea level and the lack of preservation across older upland areas (Aiuvalasit
2007; Aten 1983). Sea levels did not stabilize until the end of the Middle Archaic period, approximately
5000 B.P. (Aten 1983:157).
One of the largest local collections of Paleoindian artifacts comes from the McFaddin Beach site, located
east of the project area in Jefferson County, Texas. Numerous Paleoindian points have been recovered,
along with a significant amount of materials from later time periods. Research at the site, however, indicates
that artifacts have been re-deposited inland from an unknown location offshore (Brown 2009). As no
excavation has been conducted at the site proper, little is known about the lifeways of individuals who
utilized these projectile points. A second significant site is located in northwest Harris County, where for
the first time, Clovis projectile points have been identified in close association with other Paleoindian tool
types (Crook 2016).
Because no discrete Paleoindian components have been directly excavated in Southeast Texas, there is no
direct evidence for Paleoindian subsistence practices. In other parts of Texas and the Southeastern United
States, early discoveries of Paleoindian artifacts in conjunction with now-extinct Pleistocene megafauna,
such as mastodon and Bison antiquus, strongly biased early descriptions of Paleoindian subsistence towards
exploitation of big game animals (Bousman et al. 2004:15; Williams and Stoltman 1965). Continued
evidence from excavated Paleoindian components outside Southeast Texas suggests that Paleoindian
subsistence was more widely varied, though exploitation of big game was certainly a part (Bousman et al.
2004:75; Dunbar and Webb 1996).

One significant line of evidence for understanding Paleoindian lifeways comes from their diagnostic
projectile points; across North America, archaeologists have documented consistent Paleoindian use of
nonlocal raw materials for stone tool manufacture (Bousman et al. 2004). Most of the recovered points in
Southeast Texas are of a high grade lithic material that is scarce or absent in the region, suggesting a
widespread movement of peoples and materials over long distances in a highly mobile lifestyle that likely
depended on a diverse range of food resources (Ricklis 2004). Due to this high-mobility lifestyle, population
densities were likely low and social structure is hypothesized as relatively simple (Ricklis 2004).

Archaic Period
The Archaic period generally dates to the end of the Wisconsin glaciation and the concomitant extinction
of Pleistocene megafauna. The period is often distinguished by the development of a broad subsistence base
and evidence of a more intensive exploitation of regionally specific plant and animal resources. This change
in subsistence is marked by an adaptation in tool production to conform to new hunting techniques, food
preparation, and related activities.
The Archaic period in Texas is generally defined by pre- or non-horticultural adaptations and pre-ceramic
and pre-bow-and-arrow hunting technologies (Story 1990). In Southeast Texas, the Archaic sequence is
separate for inland groups (ca. 8000â1500 B.P.) and coastal groups (ca. 5000â2200 B.P.), due to the fact
that the coastline was not stabilized until the middle of the Archaic period (Ricklis 2004). Numerous
Archaic sites have been found along inland stream courses in Southeast Texas. The Archaic components at
these sites are represented by various types of flaked stone dart points and other lithic tools. For coastal
groups, the Archaic also includes stratified shell midden sites (Ricklis 2004).
For inland groups, a typological cluster of expanded-stem types dominates the Early Archaic (before ca.
6000 B.P.). Included in this group are early side-notched and early stemmed forms and corner-notched
points of the Keithville, Neches River, and Trinity types. These are followed by massively barbed points of
the Bell/Calf Creek series, as well as non-stemmed Tortugas points and stemmed Wells points (Ricklis
2004).
A variety of Middle Archaic tool types is reported from Southeast Texas, including Yarbrough, Bulverde,
Travis, and Pedernales in the western sector. The predominant Late Archaic types are Kent and Gary, with
Ensor and Godley points common in the western reaches of Southeast Texas (Ricklis 2004). A shift to the
use of poorer quality and more local lithic resources in Late Archaic times suggests reduced group mobility
and more tightly defined group territories (Story 1990). Several Middle to Late Archaic cemeteries have
been reported from the coastal prairies of the western part of southeast Texas. By the Late Archaic,
cemeteries were an integral part of cultural behavior along the inland margins of the coastal prairies zone,
further tying groups to specific locations of shared mortuary practice (Ricklis 2004).

Ceramic Period
The Ceramic period in Southeast Texas begins ca. 2200 B.P., with the introduction of ceramics on the Texas
Coast (Ricklis 2004; Aten 1983). Ceramics would not be found in inland southeast Texas for several
centuries (Ricklis 2004). A later, important technological innovation was the introduction of the bow and
arrow (marked by the appearance of small, light straight and expanded-stem stone point types), around
1300 B.P. (Ricklis 2004; Story 1990). The Ceramic period of southeast Texas is further divided into Early
and Late subperiods.

The Early Ceramic subperiod shows a continuation of Archaic period subsistence and settlement patterns
(Ricklis 2004). Gary contracting stem points began to replace earlier Kent points. Tchefuncte and
Mandeville ceramics began to be present in small amounts as one moves east towards the Louisiana border,
but sandy Goose Creek ceramics spread throughout an area bounded by the Brazos River to the west and
extend to the upper reaches of the Neches and Angelina Basins (Ricklis 2004; Story 1990:257). This area
has been called the Mossy Grove culture area, and appears to have been a distinct regional development
that persisted through time until the Protohistoric period (Ricklis 2004:190).
On the central Texas coast, the Late Ceramic/Late Prehistoric subperiod saw an apparent division of Toyah
phase groups in inland areas and the Rockport phase groups (Ricklis 2004). Small, light arrow point types,
such as Scallorn, Alba, and Catahoula appear during this time (Ricklis 2004). Goose Creek ceramics
continue along with the introduction of grog-tempered and some bone-tempered ceramics, and decoration
becomes more elaborate, although grog-tempered ceramics are more common and decorations are less
elaborate inland (Ricklis 2004; Story 1990). Additional characteristics of the Late subperiod include the
appearance of bison bone along with a lithic technocomplex of Perdiz arrow points, unifacial end scrapers,
blade-core lithic technology, thin bifacial knifes (often alternately beveled), and expanded base
drills/perforators made from flakes and prismatic blades (Ricklis 2004). The use of cemeteries continued
through the Ceramic period, with the Harris County Boys School Site, including 29 burials on the western
edge of Galveston Bay, and the Mitchell Ridge Site on Galveston Island, presenting notable examples
(Story 1990:242; Ricklis 1994).

Protohistoric Period
Native groups in the Galveston Bay area, due to their proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, had some of the
earliest contact with European explorers and colonists in the history of Texas. However, this contact was
not sustained or formalized, and Native American lifeways predominated in the area until the late eighteenth
to early nineteenth centuries. The Protohistoric period (A.D. 1528 to 1810) began with several sixteenthcentury expeditions to the area, most notably Alvar NuÃ±ez Cabeza de Vaca's travels stemming from the
failed Panfilo de Narvaez expedition in 1527. Although it is not completely certain where Cabeza de Vaca
landed, evidence points to Galveston Island (Ricklis 1996:107).
The identity of the inhabitants of the area around Houston at that time is unclear; called the Bidai and the
Patiri, their language is unknown, although it may have been a western Atakapan language (Newcomb
2004). The normal range given to the northernmost Karankawa tribe, the Cocos, generally does not extend
past the Brazos River valley (Ricklis 1996:6). The eastern side of Galveston Bay was inhabited by a number
of Atakapan-speaking groups, including the Atakapans (proper) and the Akokisa (Newcomb 2004).
Galveston Bay may have been a dividing line between the Karankawan and Atakapan groups, with
settlements around the bay shifting and levels of interaction changing over time. However, by the later part
of the Protohistoric period, Akokisa villages were recorded up to halfway between the San Jacinto and
Brazos rivers (Aten 1983:35).
Archaeological sites from this period are characterized by a near-disappearance of native-made pottery,
except for Goose Creek Plain (Story 1990:260). Sites 41CH110 and 41CH32 in Chambers County, in the
Trinity River area, both appear to date to this period (Aten 1983:283). At Mitchell Ridge, groups continued
to bury their dead on Galveston Island throughout the Protohistoric period, suggesting little change in
lifeways throughout the period. Conclusively-dated European artifacts do not appear at Mitchell Ridge until
the middle of the eighteenth century (Ricklis 1994:470). Subsistence did not change much during this
period. Hunting, gathering, and fishing still provided the main source of sustenance; however, the
Atakapans and Akokisa appear to have slowly begun to incorporate horticulture into their subsistence
patterns (Newcomb 2004:661).

Historic Cultural Setting
Earliest Contact/Colonial Era
European documentation, control, and exploitation of Texas grew slowly after initial contact in 1528. As
noted, Cabeza de Vaca was shipwrecked near Galveston Bay in 1528, and began a years-long odyssey
living among and documenting the Native American groups of Texas (Hester 1999). Soon afterwards,
remnants of the Hernando de Soto expedition, led by Luis de Moscoso Alvarado, crossed through central
Texas in 1542, but found the country âuninvitingâ (Hudson 1997). As such, there was little interest or
pressure for colonization and Europeans largely avoided the area.
For approximately 150 years, contact between Native American groups and Europeans was sporadic, until
the French began to make incursions into the western Gulf of Mexico. French explorer Robert Sieur de La
Salle wrecked in Matagorda Bay in 1685, during an attempt to colonize the area (Weddle 2010). This
earliest French presence in Texas proved short-lived, as La Salleâs settlement in Matagorda Bay was
attacked and destroyed, likely by the Karankawa, in 1688. The French incursion into the region provoked
Spanish retaliation, resulting in the spread of the Spanish mission system into South Texas (Weddle 2010).
The Spanish utilized a system of missions and forts to convert and pacify the native populations in eastern
Texas. The first mission to the Caddoan speaking peoples of east Texas, San Francisco de los Tejas was
founded along the Neches river in 1690 (Chipman and Joseph 2010:86). Efforts along the coastal plain
continued through the 1700s. These included Mission EspÃ­ritu Santo de Zuniga, established in 1722 near
Matagorda Bay and then moved to Victoria County in 1726 (Walter 1999); Presidio La Bahia and Mission
Rosario, established in 1749 and 1754, respectively, in Goliad County (Ricklis 1999); and Mission Nuestra
SeÃ±ora de Refugio, which was built on the mouth of the Mission River and lasted until 1828 (Newcomb
1961:63). Missions located on the San Gabriel River, near present-day Rockdale, Texas, attracted some of
the displaced Atakapan inhabitants of the Galveston Bay area.
In response to increasing French fur-trading expeditions west from the Louisiana Territory, the Spanish
established a small mission and presidio at San AgustÃ­n de Ahumada, near the village of El Orcoquisac on
the Trinity River between 1756 and 1771 (Newcomb 2004). Though the missions continued operating
throughout the Spanish Colonial period, they were often impermanent, due to consistent antagonism
between the missions and local populations, as well as often receiving poor support from the far-removed
colonial government (Ricklis 1999; Newcomb 2004; Carlson and Corbin 1999). Though the Spanish
claimed the area, the Texas coastal plain would remain mostly native until the Mexican revolution and the
enticement of empresarios and colonists to the area. Even by 1804, the total non-native population of Texas,
even including better populated parts of central Texas at San Antonio, were likely less than 4,000 (Chipman
and Joseph 2010:219).
After Mexico gained independence from Spain, Mexico attempted to create a more populated buffer state
in Texas, in an effort to protect against encroachments by the nascent United States of America. To this
end, Mexican officials invited colonization of Texas, doling out land to farmers and ranchers and deferring
payment for several years (Henderson 1928). These policies also continued the Spanish system of
empresarios, by which land agents could obtain large grants of lands, which could then be separately
divided, instead of individual families petitioning the Mexican authorities. The area around Houston was
not initially included in any empresario grant, but petitions from new colonists soon had the area, which
was valued for the ease of transportation on the San Jacinto and Trinity River watersheds, added to Stephen
F. Austinâs grant (Henson 2010).

A majority of the empresarios and colonists were Anglo-American and white settlers (Henderson 1928).
Slavery was allowed within Mexico, until banned by President Guerrero in 1829; however, Texas was
specifically exempted (De LeÃ³n 2010). Despite this favorable treatment, suspicions of the increasingly
Anglo-American character of Texas and the increasing power and autonomy of Anglo-Americans in Texas
led to pushes by the Mexican central authorities under General Santa Ana to revoke the colonization laws
and promote a general trend of de-federalization of political control (De LeÃ³n 2010). Viewing these
capricious changes to law as tyranny, a number of Texans, including several former empresarios, convened
and declared independence for the Republic of Texas on March 2, 1836 (De LeÃ³n 2010).

Republic of Texas/Pre-Civil War
After the defeat of Santa Anna at the Battle of San Jacinto, the new Texan Congress settled on the nascent
town of Houston as the first national capital, and formed the county of Harrisburg (later to be renamed
Harris) in late 1836 and Montgomery County in 1837 (Henson 2010; McComb 1969). Although the capital
was short-lived, and relocated to Austin in 1839, the new city continued to grow, albeit slowly.
For a new, small, and relatively poor nation, protection and recognition by foreign nations was vitally
important. Annexation by the United States had always been one distinct possibility for Texas, and one that
was promoted by Sam Houston during his first term as president (Nance 2010). By the 1844 United States
presidential election, the question of Texas annexation was also on the front of the United Statesâ national
mind. The election of expansionist President James K. Polk was taken as a good sign of the desire of the
United States to include another slave state in the nation and Texas President Anson Jones pushed for
Texans to vote on the issue (Nance 2010). On October 13, 1845, annexation and the new Texas State
Constitution were accepted by overwhelming popular vote, and Texas became a part of the United States
on December 29, 1845 (Nance 2010).
The subsequent years leading up to the Civil War were generally a time of expansion and consolidation of
the primarily plantation-based farming economy, especially within the coastal plain region. Cotton
production increased over 600 percent between 1849 and 1859 (Britton et al. 2010). Slavery also expanded
at an astounding rate. Between 1850 and 1860, the overall number of slaves increased by 130,000,
expanding from 27 percent of the population to 30 percent of the population in the years just before the
Civil War (Campbell 2013). At the same time, other industries grew slowly, possibly due to the
overwhelming reliance on âKing Cotton.â Only 5 percent of Texans were involved in commercial activity
and only 1 percent involved in manufacturing (Campbell 2013). Transportation technology represented one
of the few areas of industrial development. By 1850, Houston was the home to the first railroad in Texas,
the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos, and Colorado (later to be known as the Galveston, Harrisburg, and San Antonio)
ran a line west through Houston (Werner 2010). A second line opened to the northwest in 1856, and by
1861, there was around 470 miles of track already laid in Texas (Werner 2010).

Civil War Period
Although Governor Sam Houston opposed any step that might lead Texas to break from the Union that he
had fought so hard to join, Texans voted to secede from the United States in February of 1861 (Wooster
2010). Up to 90,000 Texans served in the Confederate forces, mostly fighting outside the state boundaries.
Only the seacoast saw significant fighting during the war and most action focused on Galveston (Wooster
2010). Although Houston was not directly affected by fighting during the Civil War, prices rose and
hardship increased (McComb 1969:75). In June of 1865, two U.S. regiments reoccupied Houston, installing
a military government in the city (McComb 1969:77).

Post-Civil War/Reconstruction
Reconstruction brought massive changes to the economic and cultural systems of Texas. Many of the
former agricultural elites lost much of their wealth as a result of the abolition of slavery (Moneyhon 2010).
At the same time, former slaves, now emancipated, were provided with little support from their former
masters. There was some political advancement, including the election of black aldermen in Houston for
the first time (McComb 1969:81). Change was relatively slow, otherwise. The railroads slowly expanded
throughout the postwar period, with the Houston East and West Texas Railway crossing north and east of
Houston completed between 1876 and 1886 (Young 2010). Cotton remained the most significant cash crop
(Moneyhon 2010). Northeast of the Houston area, lumber exploitation was an important industry, spurred
on by the expanding railway supply lines (Long 2016).

Late Nineteenth/Early Twentieth Century
After 1880, rail transportation in the region increased significantly, principally following the introduction
of the Texas and New Orleans Railroad (now the Southern Pacific Transportation Company) in 1860, which
linked Houston to Orange. This railroad was later linked to the Louisiana and Western Railroad with
through service to the City of New Orleans in 1881 (Kleiner 2008). By 1890, Midwestern developers had
purchased land along the new North Galveston, Houston, and Kansas City Railroad, which headed east
from Houston along the southern side of Buffalo Bayou towards Morganâs Point. This was done to attract
other out-of-state farmers to raise fruit, berries, and vegetables, or just to seek a more temperate climate
(Henson 2008).
Oil exploration in the early-twentieth century generated a population explosion in the region, particularly
in Humble with the oil boom at Moonshine Hill in 1905. Oil was also discovered at Goose Creek and Tabbs
Bay, which led to the establishment of a temporary boomtown from 1915 to 1917. In 1919, Ross Sterling
and the Humble Oil and Refining Company (now Exxon) built a refinery near the oilfield on the San Jacinto
above the mouth of Goose Creek. The development of the area as an industrial hub really began in 1911,
when the formation of the Houston Ship Channel Navigation District was approved. The 50-mile-long
channel was deepened and eventually widened to allow oceangoing vessels. Petroleum and other refineries
popped up all along Buffalo Bayou and the San Jacinto River (Henson 2008; Kleiner 2008). In modern
times, the regionâs economy continues to center around the shipping, agricultural, and petroleum industries.
Many residents of the region find employment in the Houston metropolitan area.

BACKGROUND REVIEW
The background review consisted of a cultural resources and environmental literature review of the
proposed project area, as well as a 1-mile radius around the project area. An SWCA archaeologist reviewed
the corresponding USGS 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle map on the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
(TASA), a restricted online database, for any previously recorded surveys and historic or prehistoric sites
located in or near the project area. Site files, relevant maps, National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
properties, State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) listings, Registered Texas Historic Landmarks, cemeteries,
and local neighborhood surveys were also examined. Listings on TASA are limited to projects under
purview of the Antiquities Code of Texas or the NHPA of 1966. Therefore, all work conducted in the area
may not be available. The Texas Historic Sites Overlay, aerial photographs, Bureau of Economic Geology
Maps, and the NRCS Web Soil Survey were also examined for historical and environmental information
related to the project area.

Previous Investigations
The background review revealed that at least 37 previous archaeological surveys have been conducted
within 1 mile of the proposed project area (Appendix A). Nine of these surveys intersect with the proposed
project area and two are within 100 feet (Figure 2 and Figure 3). For brevity, only these 11 surveys will be
discussed below.
No previously conducted cultural resources surveys intersect with Section A of the proposed project. A
2013 survey by SWCA for the Rothwood Tract Mitigation Bank intersects Section B of the proposed project
area; no cultural resources were identified (THC 2016).
Horizon conducted two surveys for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2002. Both surveys
intersect Section C of the proposed project area; neither identified any cultural resources (THC 2016). In
2012, HRA Gray & Pape conducted a development survey along Spring and Willow creeks that intersects
the southern one-third of Section C. Two sites (41HR1127 and 41HR1128) were identified; however,
neither is within or adjacent to the proposed project area (THC 2016). In 2013, HRA Gray & Pape
conducted a residential survey that also intersects Section C. This project identified one site (41HR1137),
which is within 200 feet of the project area. The site was previously determined not eligible for the NRHP
(THC 2016). Perennial Environment conducted a survey in 2013 along Willow Creek where it intersects
Section C (THC 2016). One site (41HR1138) was identified; however, the site is not within or adjacent to
the proposed project area.
Five previous surveys intersect or are immediately adjacent to Section D of the proposed project. A 1989
survey of Burrough Park by Moore Archeological Consultants intersects the project area. Three sites
(41HR625, 41HR626, and 41HR627) were identified; however, all are more than 300 feet from the
proposed project area and will not be impacted (THC 2016). A 2004 survey by Lopez Garcia Group for the
widening of FM 2978 intersects Section D. One site (41HR981) was identified and is located within the
proposed project area. Site 41HR981 was determined not eligible for the NRHP (THC 2016) and is further
discussed in the next section. The 2013 Fairway Farm residential survey completed by HRA Gray & Pape
intersects Section D (THC 2016). Two sites (41HR1139 and 41HR1140) were identified. Site 41HR1139
is not within or adjacent to the proposed project area. Site 41HR1140 is located within the proposed project
area and has been recommended eligible for the NRHP. This site is further discussed in the next section.
Two projects, a 2012 East Texas Region survey by Atkins and a 2013 FM 2978 expansion survey by HRA
Gray & Pipe pass within 100 feet of Section D; neither project identified cultural resources (THC 2016).

Previously Recorded Cultural Resources
The background review identified 42 previously recorded cultural resources within 1 mile of the proposed
project area (see Figure 2 and Figure 3). This includes 33 previously recorded archaeological sites, 6
cemeteries, and 3 historical markers (Appendix B).

Archaeological Sites
A total of 33 archaeological sites have been previously recorded within 1 mile of the proposed project area
(see Appendix B). This includes 26 prehistoric sites, 4 historic sites, and 3 multicomponent (both historic
and prehistoric) sites. Five of these sites (41HR625, 41HR981, 41HR1098, 41HR1099, and 41HR1140) are
within or immediately adjacent to (within 100 feet of) the proposed project area and will be discussed
below.
SITE 41HR625

Site 41HR625 was identified by Moore Archaeological Consulting during the 1989 survey of the Burroughs
Park Tract. The site was described as being located on the summit edge of a bluff above Spring Creek. The
site was estimated to be at least 35 m north-south by 20 m east-west and was noted to be bisected by a
logging road. Artifacts, including plain ceramic sherds, a probable Perdiz point, lithic debitage, and charcoal
were identified between 30 and 100 cmbs. The original recorder recommended the site not eligible for the
NRHP (THC 2016). As recorded, the site is located approximately 58 feet from the proposed project area.
As such, SWCA proposed additional testing along the portion of the current project area adjacent to the
site. This included shovel testing at 20-m intervals or less, and deep testing with augers, as appropriate.
SITE 41HR981

Site 41HR981 was identified by the Lopez Garcia Group in 2004, during the FM 2978 widening survey
(THC 2016). The site was described as a prehistoric lithic scatter containing 41 pieces of chert debitage and
1 biface fragment; no features or diagnostic artifacts were identified (THC 2016). The site was noted to be
disturbed, as it was being used as a staging area for construction and storage area for portable toilets (THC
2016). On October 28, 2004, the THC determined that the site was not eligible for the NRHP (THC 2016).
SITE 41HR1098

Site 41HR1098 was identified by HRA Gray & Pape in 2011, during survey for a 315-acre development
near Spring, Texas (Nash and Spalding 2011). The site was described as a prehistoric occupation site which
yielded chert flakes and some ceramics. Phase II eligibility testing was conducted at the site and deep testing
identified artifacts down to 230 cmbs. Based on the types and distributions of artifacts, the investigators
determined that the site was largely eroded or a very brief occupation (Nash and Spalding 2011). The site
was recommended not eligible for the NRHP and the THC concurred on July 27, 2011 (Nash and Spalding
2011; THC 2016). The proposed project in this area will be along existing pathway; no additional
disturbances are anticipated to the site.

SITE 41HR1099

Site 41HR1099 was identified by HRA Gray & Pape in 2011, during survey for a 315-acre development
near Spring, Texas (Nash and Spalding 2011). The site contained two pieces of lithic debitage, one in each
of two positive shovel tests located 15 m apart. One flake was identified between 40 and 50 cmbs and the
other between 60 and 70 cmbs. No deep testing was conducted at the site. No development was planned for
this area; therefore, no NRHP eligibility was recommended for the site (Nash and Spalding 2011). As such,
SWCA proposed additional testing along the portion of the proposed project within the site area. This
included shovel testing at 20-m intervals or less, and deep testing with augers, as appropriate.
SITE 41HR1140

Site 41HR1140 was identified by HRA Gray & Pape in 2013, during the Fairway Farms residential survey
(Hughey et al. 2015). The site is described as a large prehistoric occupation area located on the south bank
of Spring Creek and dating to the Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric time periods. Further testing was
conducted and the site was determined eligible for the NRHP (Hughey et al. 2015).
In 2014, HRA Gray & Pape completed a data recovery within the areas of the site that would be impacted
by the proposed residential development (Scott et al. 2014). Based on evidence of pedogenic processes,
lack of features, comingling of components, and evidence of natural and man-made disturbances, HRA
Gray & Pape determined that these portions of the site do not appear intact (Scott et al. 2014). Further work
was recommended in any areas of the site located outside the area of impact noted for the residential
construction (Scott et al. 2014).
The portion of the site area nearest Spring Creek was investigated by HRA Gray & Pape during the initial
discovery and eligibility testing stages (Hughey et al. 2015); however, this portion was âpreserved in placeâ
during the data recovery (Scott et al. 2014). This portion of the site is within the disturbed berm and highly
sloped bank of Spring Creek and is unlikely to contain any intact deposits. For this portion of the site,
SWCA recommended shovel testing at 20-m intervals or less, and deep testing with augers, as appropriate.
The northern site boundary had not been clearly established, as it was located outside the residential survey
area. The adjacent area within the known site area showed a number of positive shovel tests and test units,
indicating the site could extend to the northeast, likely to the low-lying area to the north. SWCA proposed
to systematically survey and shovel test to define the northern boundary of the site outside of the previously
investigated area and within the current project area.

Cemeteries
Six cemeteries are located within 1 mile of the proposed project area (see Appendix B). Five of the
cemeteries (McCall, Zion Lutheran, Bonin Family, Pevateaux, and an unnamed cemetery) are
approximately 0.4 to 0.9 mile from the proposed project area and will not be impacted.
The Bogs-Hufsmith Cemetery (also known as Bogs Cemetery) is located on the north side of Bogs Road,
approximately 0.3 mile east of the intersection of Hufsmith Road (FM 2978) and Bogs Road in Tomball. It
should be noted that the location of this cemetery is incorrect as currently displayed on TASA (THC 2016).

Historical Markers
Three historical markers are located within 1 mile of the proposed project area (see Appendix B). The
Oklahoma School (Marker No. 13122) was erected in 2002 and commemorates the early settlement of the
Oklahoma Community and the early education efforts of the communityâs pioneer farm families (THC
2016). The Zion Lutheran Church (Marker No. 15739) was erected in 2009 and commemorates the early
German settlements of Stuebner and Hufsmith, as well as the cemetery adjacent to the church where many
early settlers are buried (THC 2016). The Bonin Family Cemetery (Marker No. 16747) was erected in 2010
to commemorate the Bonin family, who were early French settlers in the area (THC 2016).

Potential Cultural Resources
Historical topographic maps (USGS 1920, 1960, 1961, 1962), aerial photographs (NETR 1957, 1964, 1973,
1981), and historical maps on the Texas Historical Overlay (Foster et al. 2006) were also examined. No
additional potential cultural resources were identified within or immediately adjacent to the project area
during the review of these sources.

FIELD INVESTIGATIONS
Field Methods
The archaeological investigation of the proposed project area was designed to be of sufficient intensity to
determine the nature, extent, and if possible, significance of any cultural resources located within the project
area. An intensive pedestrian survey with systematic shovel testing was conducted within the project area.
The survey met all THC minimum archaeological survey standards for such projects with any exceptions
thoroughly documented. The field survey consisted of two archaeologists walking one transect within a
100-foot-wide survey corridor. During the survey, the archaeologists examined the ground surface and
erosional profiles for cultural resources. This examination included pedestrian survey with shovel testing
within the proposed project area.
Shovel tests were 30 cm in diameter and excavated in 20-cm arbitrary levels to 1 m in depth, to culturally
sterile deposits, or to the anticipated depth of disturbance for the project, whichever came first. The matrix
was screened through Â¼-inch hardware mesh. The location of each shovel test was plotted using a global
positioning system (GPS) receiver, and each test was recorded on appropriate project field forms.
A review of the soils in the project area indicated there are deep Holocene alluvium; therefore, backhoe
trenching would normally be required. However, due to the nature of the proposed project, SWCA assumes
that the depth of project impacts will be shallow (2 feet or less); therefore, no backhoe trenching was
necessary. Additionally, the trail crosses through heavily wooded areas which would prohibit access with
heavy machinery.
If an archaeological site was encountered in the proposed project area during the investigation, it was
explored as much as possible with consideration to land access constraints. Any discovered sites were
assessed in regard to potential significance so that recommendations could be made for proper management
(avoidance, non-avoidance, or further work). Additional shovel tests would be conducted per THC
standards to define horizontal and vertical boundaries for each site. State of Texas Archeological Site Data
Forms would be filled out for each archaeological site discovered during the investigation. A detailed plan
map of each site would be produced, and site locations would be plotted on USGS 7.5-minute topographic
maps and other relevant project maps.
As noted previously, additional testing was proposed within portions of the project intersected by or
immediately adjacent to sites 41HR625 and 41HR1099. This included shovel tests at 20-m intervals or less
and deep testing by augering, where appropriate. Additional testing was also proposed for portions of site
41HR1140, including additional testing along the western side of the site along the creek and to delineate
the extent of the northern boundary of the site within the project area.
SWCA conducted a non-collection survey. Artifacts were tabulated, analyzed, and documented in the field,
but not collected. Temporally diagnostic artifacts were described in detail and photographed. Only
especially rare artifacts or discoveries were collected.

Results of Field Investigations
Intensive archaeological survey was conducted throughout the entirety of the project area from September
27 through October 5, 2016. A total of 149 shovel tests were excavated throughout the project area and to
delineate cultural resources within the survey corridor. Six additional shovel tests were attempted, but not
excavated due to areas of disturbances or excessive slope. The results for all shovel tests are presented in
Appendix C.
The investigation was conducted in four segments, identified as Sections A through D. During the current
investigation, SWCA revisited five previously identified site locations (41HR625, 41HR981, 41HR1098,
41HR1099, and 41HR1140), identified two isolated finds, and preliminarily surveyed an historic cemetery
(Bogs-Hufsmith Cemetery). Discussion of the investigations at these locations follow.

Section A
Approximately 25 percent of Section A follows existing an unimproved pathway, requiring no additional
testing (Figure 5 and Figure 6). The remainder of the section is in forested areas on terraces and slopes
adjacent to Spring Creek (Figure 4 and Figure 7), with a small portion crossing the existing right-of-way
for an overhead transmission line. Ground surface visibility in this section was generally low,
approximately 5 percent or less. Soils in the area tended to be compact and contain hydric soils in most
areas.

Figure 4. Overview of Section A, near Shovel Test (ST) 10, view west.

No cultural materials or features were identified on the surface of Section A. A total of 26 shovel tests were
excavated within Section A; all were negative for cultural materials. This portion of the project area crosses
through two previously recorded sites, 41HR1098 and 41HR1099, which are discussed below.

SITE 41HR1098

Site 41HR1098 is a previously identified prehistoric site located within Section A. The site contained lithics
and some ceramics. The site was determined NOT ELIGIBLE for the NRHP on July 27, 2011 (THC 2016).
The current project in this area will be along existing pathway and no disturbances are anticipated to the
site; therefore, no additional subsurface testing was conducted in this portion of the project area. As such,
SWCA found no evidence to suggest an alternative recommendation and no further work is recommended.
SITE 41HR1099

Site 41HR1099 is a previously identified site located within Section A. The site contained two pieces of
lithic debitage, one in each of two positive shovel tests located 15 m apart (THC 2016). One flake was
identified between 40 and 50 cmbs and the other between 60 and 70 cmbs. No deep testing was conducted
at the site and no NRHP eligibility was recommended.
During the current investigation, the site area was within a dense hardwood forest with very dense
underbrush (Figure 8). No cultural materials were identified on the surface of site 41HR1099. Four shovel
tests were excavated in the vicinity of site 41HR1099 within the survey corridor; all were negative for
cultural materials or cultural features. It is possible that the site is mis-mapped or does not extend into the
current project area. As such, NRHP and SAL eligibility for the site 41HR1099 remains
UNDETERMINED; however, SWCA recommends a finding that the proposed project will have NO
ADVERSE EFFECT on any significant deposits at the site and no further work is recommended at this
time.

Section B
Section B crosses areas of scrub shrub uplands and bottomland terraces with hardwood forests (Figure 9,
Figure 10, and Figure 11). Portions of this section were adjacent to existing trails/paths. Ground surface
visibility in this section was low, approximately 5 percent or less. Soils in the section ranged from deep
sands to frequently inundated hydric clays.
No cultural materials were identified on the surface in Section B. A total of 22 shovel tests were excavated
within Section B; all were negative for cultural materials. One cultural feature, a concrete foundation, was
identified as Isolated Find 2, and is discussed below.
ISOLATED FIND 2

A concrete foundation measuring 40 x 46 feet was identified on the east side of an old access road where it
previously crossed the proposed project area (Figure 12). A few wire nails and iron fragments were noted,
in addition to one cinder block. A review of USGS maps (USGS 1916, 1920, 1942, 1960, 1973, 1982, 1995,
2002) shows no structure in that location; however, beginning with the 1982 map, a built-up area adjacent
to an access road is visible. Aerial photographs (NETR 1957, 1964, 1973, 1981, 1995, 2002) show the
adjacent access road through a forested area beginning in 1973. The area containing the structure is
indistinct on the 1981 and 1995 aerials, but it appears that the area has been cleared. The pad is visible with
associated sheds, tanks, and/or trucks on both aerial photographs and topographic maps in 2002. Only the
concrete pad was in evidence during the current investigation.
The concrete foundation likely represents some type of minor agricultural or industrial use from the late
1970s/early 1980s. Based on the presumed age and the lack of remains other than the concrete pad, the
isolated find does not constitute an historic-age site and no trinomial will be requested. Isolated Find 2 is
recommended NOT ELIGIBLE for the NRHP or SAL and no further work is recommended.

Section C
Approximately one-third of Section C (Figure 13), the southern-most portion of the section, was previously
surveyed by HRA Gray & Pape in 2012 (Scott and Spalding 2014). The survey was completed for a
residential development within the 366-acre tract owned by D.R. Horton-Texas, Ltd. Under U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers (USACE)-Galveston District File No. SWG-2014-00043 (USACE 2015). No cultural
resources were identified within or immediately adjacent to (within 100 feet of) the current project area
(Scott and Spalding 2014). Much of the residential development has been completed, as can be seen in
Figure 14. As such, no further survey was conducted in this area during the current investigation.
The remainder of Section C was surveyed during the current investigation. The section crosses low-lying
areas, a disc golf course, a golf course, and a terrace with hardwoods and very dense underbrush (see Figure
13, Figure 15, and Figure 16). Ground surface visibility was low, approximately 5 percent or less. Soils in
the surveyed area were generally deep, loose sandy loams, with some areas frequently inundated.
No cultural materials or features were identified on the surface. A total of 38 shovel tests were excavated
within Section C. One test was positive and identified as Isolated Find 1, discussed below.

ISOLATED FIND 1

Isolated Find 1 is a single prehistoric chert flake found within ST 63 between 0 and 20 cmbs. The location
is on a terrace overlooking the west bank of Spring Creek. Vegetation in the area consisted of a hardwood
forest with a relatively dense underbrush (Figure 17). An additional eight shovel tests were excavated to
delineate the find; all were negative for cultural materials. No diagnostic artifacts or cultural features were
identified. Due to the limited cultural material identified, the area was found insufficient to be considered
as a site and a trinomial will not be requested. As such, Isolated Find 1 is recommended NOT ELIGIBLE
for the NRHP or SAL and no further work is recommended.

Figure 17. Overview of Isolated Find 1, near ST 63, facing north.

Section D
Section D crosses forested slopes and terraces. A large portion of the proposed trail in this area is adjacent
to a residential development that is currently under construction (Figure 18, Figure 19, and Figure 20).
Ground surface visibility within Section D was low, approximately 5 percent or less. Soils were generally
deep, fine sandy loams throughout the section.
No cultural materials were identified on the surface. A total of 63 shovel tests were excavated within Section
D. An additional 6 shovel tests were attempted, but not completed due to locations within drainage areas or
active construction areas. A total of 8 shovel tests were positive for cultural materials; all were within the
recorded boundaries of site 41HR1140. These results, as well as the results of survey for sites 41HR625,
41HR981, and the Bogs-Hufsmith Cemetery are discussed below.

SITE 41HR625

Site 41HR625 is a previous identified prehistoric site described as being located on the summit edge of a
bluff above Spring Creek. The site was estimated to be at least 35 m north-south by 20 m east-west and was
noted to be bisected by a logging road. Artifacts, including plain ceramic sherds, a probable Perdiz point,
lithic debitage, and charcoal, were identified between 30 and 100 cmbs (THC 2016).
As the recorded centroid for the site location is within 17 m (58 feet) of the site, SWCA conducted additional
tests within the survey corridor adjacent to the site (see Figure 19). No cultural materials or features were
identified on the surface. Four shovel tests were excavated within the survey corridor adjacent to the site
area; all were negative for cultural materials. It appears the site does not extend into the current project area.
The original recorder recommended the site NOT ELIGIBLE for the NRHP. SWCA found no evidence to
suggest an alternative recommendation and no further work is recommended within the survey corridor.
SITE 41HR981

Site 41HR981 is a previously identified prehistoric site containing 41 pieces of chert debitage and 1 biface
fragment; no features or diagnostic artifacts were identified (THC 2016). The site was noted to be disturbed,
as it was being used as a staging area for construction and storage area for portable toilets (THC 2016). On
October 28, 2004, the THC determined that the site was NOT ELIGIBLE for the NRHP (THC 2016).
SWCA excavated two shovel tests in the vicinity of the recorded site area (see Figure 20); both were
negative for cultural materials. As such, SWCA found no evidence to suggest an alternative
recommendation and no further work is recommended.
SITE 41HR1140

Site 41HR1140 is a previously recorded prehistoric campsite dating to the Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric
time periods. The site is located on the southern bank of Spring Creek (Figure 21). Previous work at the
site by HRA Gray & Pape included survey and site testing that resulted in a determination that the site is
eligible for the NRHP (Hughey et al. 2015). In 2014, HRA Gray & Pape completed a data recovery within
portions of the site that would be impacted by the proposed Fairway Farms residential development (Scott
et al. 2014).
Materials identified at the site included lithic tools and debitage, prehistoric ceramics, fired clay, some small
mammal bone, and fire-cracked rock (FCR). Lithic raw materials include chert, quartzite, and petrified
wood. Projectile points identified at the site included Archaic points (Gary and Kent), Late Prehistoric
points (Clifton/Perdiz, Perdiz, Friley, or Catahoula), as well as numerous untyped points (Scott et al. 2015).
Prehistoric ceramics included Goose Creek Plain and Goose Creek Incised, as well as numerous
indeterminate types with sandy pastes or sand, sand and grog, or sand and grit tempering (Scott et al. 2015).
Based on evidence of pedogenic processes, lack of features, comingling of components, and evidence of
natural and man-made disturbances within the area of the data recovery, HRA Gray & Pape determined
that the portion of the site within the assumed disturbance area for the residential development does not
appear intact (Scott et al. 2014). No further work was recommended for the area to be disturbed by the
residential development. The remainder of the site was âpreserved in placeâ and further work was
recommended for any areas of the site located outside the area of impact noted for the residential
construction (Scott et al. 2014).

Site 41HR1140 is naturally segmented into three areas (northern, central, and southern), with the areas
being separated by deep, narrow drainages for intermittent streams that lead to Spring Creek (Hughey et al.
2015). The portion of the site within the current project area is within a forested area with oak, sweetgum,
yaupon, and pine; a thick humus layer of leaf litter was noted. The area to the east of the project area is in
active construction for the residential development (Figure 22).

Figure 22. Construction of residential development within site 41HR1140, east of
the project area, near ST 127, facing east.

The current investigation did not find evidence of the site continuing to the north within the proposed project
area. Only debitage was identified during the current investigation, no ceramics or cultural features were
identified. A few pieces of historic materials were identified as disturbances. Overall, the results of the
current investigation within the proposed trail appears to coincide closely with the results from HRA Gray
& Pape. Three small clusters of positive shovel tests were identified within the project area and will be
discussed below.
Locus 1

Locus 1 includes positive STs 99 and 100 within a forested area in the northern portion of the site,
approximately 35 m northwest of the estimated area of impact for the residential development (Figure 23
and Figure 24). Locus 1 is in the middle of HRA Gray & Papeâs ST C1, Test Unit (TU) 6, and Data Recovery
Unit (DRU) 40 within HRA Gray & Papeâs site Area C (Scott et al. 2014).

(69 percent) of all artifacts recovered were below 80 cmbs, and up to 150 cmbs (Scott et al. 2014:48).
Approximately 91 percent of flakes larger than 15 mm in dimension were recovered below 80 cmbs. The
disproportionate number of larger flakes at greater depth suggests evidence of post-depositional sorting by
water or eolian forces (Scott et al. 2014:54). Additionally, the larger flakes found together at lower levels
were of different materials, suggesting multiple events that have been combined together post deposition
(Scott et al. 2014:54).
As seen by the metal fragment identified 20-40 cmbs within ST 100, there is some additional disturbance
of the site near the surface. HRA Gray & Pape (Hughey et al. 2015:52) noted that piles of modern brick,
mortar, and concrete, as well as fence posts and barbed wire, were scattered throughout the site area,
indicating the area may have been developed in the past.
Limited materials were identified in the shovel tests in Locus 1 within the project area. The HRA Gray &
Pape investigations determined that post-depositional sorting has occurred within the area, leaving the
majority of the artifacts below 80 cmbs and in a secondary context (Hughey et al. 2015; Scott et al. 2014).
Based on the lack of primary context for the artifacts and lack of cultural features identified within the
current and previous investigations, Locus 1 is unlikely to contain any significant deposit at the site which
would merit further examination or avoidance.
Locus 2

Locus 2 includes positive STs 110 and 153 and is within a forested area in the central portion of the site,
approximately 25 m northwest of the estimated area of impact for the residential development (see Figure
23 and Figure 26). Locus 2 is immediately southwest of HRA Gray & Papeâs ST C3.

SWCA identified 6 artifacts within Locus 2 (Table 3). Within ST 110, three chert flakes were recovered
from 40 to 60 cmbs and 1 chert flake and 1 quartzite flake were recovered from 60 to 80 cmbs (Figure 27).
Within ST 153, 1 petrified wood flake was recovered between 0 and 20 cmbs. HRA Gray & Pape identified
1 debitage within ST C3 between 90 and 100 cmbs (Hughey et al. 2015:54).

The remaining shovel tests in this locus, including those from SWCA and HRA Gray & Pape, were negative
for cultural materials. Overall, this locus is very small and contains minimal evidence of occupation. As
such, Locus 2 does not represent a significant deposit at the site which would merit further examination or
avoidance.

Locus 3

Locus 3 includes positive STs 113, 114, 115, and 148 in a forested area within the central portion of the
site, immediately adjacent to a steep slope leading to Spring Creek, and approximately 35 m west of the
estimated area of impact for the residential development (see Figure 23 and Figure 28). Locus 3 is located
intermixed with HRA Gray & Pape STs A7 and J23; and TUs 3 and 4, approximately 100 m northwest of
HRA Gray & Pape site Area B (Scott et al. 2014).
SWCA identified 15 artifacts in Locus 3, including 11 prehistoric and 4 historic artifacts (Table 4). Within
ST 113, 1 projectile point and 7 chert flakes were fairly evenly distributed between 0 and 100 cmbs (Figure
29). The chert projectile point is identified as a heavily re-worked Gary or Kent point (Figure 30), which
date from the Middle to Late Archaic periods (Turner et al. 2011:107, 120). ST 114 contained historic red
brick fragments from 20-40 cmbs. ST 115 contained 2 chert flakes between 20 and 80 cmbs and ST 148
contained 1 petrified wood flake from 40-60 cmbs.

HRA Gray & Pape also recovered limited materials in the area. ST A7 contained 2 debitage and 1 ceramic
from 20-60 cmbs (Hughey et al. 2015:54). ST J23 contained 2 debitage from 40-60 cmbs (Hughey et al.
2014:54). TU 3 contained 17 debitage, 1 core, and 1 FCR between 0 and 67 cmbs, with amounts decreasing
with depth (Hughey et al. 2015:63-64). Materials were not recovered in TU 4 until 40 cmbs, when 13
debitage and 2 ceramics were found between 60 and 100 cmbs (Hughey et al. 2015:64-66). Artifact density
was low in TU 3 and TU 4 had the lowest artifact density at the site during the Phase II testing (Hughey et
al. 2015:63-66).
Both TU 3 and TU 4 were excavated into sterile soils, with no materials found below 80 cmbs and 100
cmbs, respectively. TU 3 was further augered to 341 cmbs and TU 4 to 355 cmbs (Hughey et al. 2015:6366). TU 4 contained a burned area approximately 30-50 cmbs, but no cultural materials were found
associated and it is likely the result of a naturally-occurring event (Hughey et al. 2015:64-66).
The red brick fragments identified in ST 114 indicate there has been some disturbance in the upper levels
of the site area. As noted previously, similar materials were found throughout the site area by HRA Gray
& Pape, indicating that the site area may have been developed previously (Hughey et al. 2015:52).
Based on the results of the current investigation and the results of the HRA Gray & Pape Phase I and II
investigations, this locus appears to contain minimal evidence of occupation and no cultural features were
identified. As noted, there appears to be disturbance in the area and the recovered materials were found at
varying depth, indicating that there is not an intact living surface in this area. As such, Locus 3 appears
unlikely to contain a significant deposit at the site which needs to be further examined or avoided.

Summary

Site 41HR1140 is a previously recorded prehistoric occupation site dating to the Late Archaic to Late
Prehistoric periods. The site has been investigated for the current project and previous survey, testing, and
data recovery by HRA Gray & Pape. The site was previously determined ELIGIBLE for the NRHP. The
subsequent data recovery at the site by HRA Gray & Pape determined that the investigated areas of the site
did not contain intact living surfaces. The current investigation identified three loci of artifact
concentrations within the project area. These sparse concentrations contained limited evidence of
occupation and/or were also in secondary contexts. As such, SWCA recommends a finding that the current
project will have NO ADVERSE EFFECT on any significant deposits at site 41HR1140.
BOGS-HUFSMITH CEMETERY

The Bogs-Hufsmith Cemetery (also known as Bogs Cemetery) is located on the north side of Bogs Road,
approximately 0.3 mile east of the intersection of Hufsmith Road (FM 2978) and Bogs Road in Tomball. It
should be noted that the location of this cemetery is incorrect as currently displayed on TASA (THC 2016).
The cemetery has at least 168 interments dating from 1911 to present (Find A Grave 2016). The most
common surnames include Blackshear, Lackey, and Smith (Find A Grave 2016).
The overall estimated size of the cemetery is approximately 265 x 265 feet (approximately 1.6 acres).
During the current investigation, the grass within the cemetery had been recently mowed/manicured in an
area approximately 250 feet north-south by 230 feet east-west (approximately 1.0 acre) (Figure 31).
Headstones/graves were visible outside the mown area (Figure 33 and Figure 34), but no evidence of
headstones/graves were visible within the outer treeline.

The Bogs-Hufsmith Cemetery is an historic cemetery with at least 168 interments dating from 1911 to
present. NRHP and SAL eligibility for the Bogs-Hufsmith Cemetery is UNDETERMINED, as further
archival work would be necessary to assess the cemeteryâs potential to contribute to the understanding of
local or regional history. SWCA recommends surface scraping outside the cemetery area to ensure that no
unmarked graves extend into the proposed construction workspace. An easement in this area is currently
being transferred to Harris County; therefore, this work cannot be completed at this time. Once available,
the surface scraping will be conducted under SWCA oversight to ensure avoidance of the cemetery and will
be reported in an addendum to this report prior to trail construction.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On behalf of HCP4, SWCA has conducted an intensive archaeological survey of the proposed Spring Creek
Greenway Trail, Phase V. The proposed hike and bike trail will be constructed in four sections, A-D
(totaling approximately 7.7 miles, approximately 93 acres), on lands owned by Harris County and under
the control of HCP4, as well as privately-owned land. The sections connect to portions of the trail previously
constructed. The project area is located on the south side of Spring Creek west of Interstate 45 in northern
Harris County, Texas.
Archaeological investigations were conducted pursuant to the acquisition of a USACE Section 404 permit
in accordance with 33 CFR Part 325, Appendix C (Processing Department of Army Permits: Procedures
for the Protection of Historic Properties; Final Rule 1990; with current Interim Guidance Documents dated
April 25, 2005 and January 31, 2007); and Section 106 of the NHPA (16 USC 470) and its implementing
regulations 36 CFR 800. As the portions of the project area are owned by a political subdivision of the State
of Texas, work was additionally conducted in compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas
Natural Resource Code, Title 9, Chapter 191) and accompanying Rules of Practice and Procedure (Texas
Administrative Code, Title 13, Chapter 26) under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7791.
The background review identified a number of surveys within 1 mile of the project area, 11 of which
intersect or are located immediately adjacent to (within 100 feet) of the current project area. The southern
one-third of Section C within the D.R. Horton tract was previously surveyed. Additionally, the easternmost portion of Section A is along existing developed trail. No additional survey was completed in these
two areas.
During the current investigation, SWCA identified or revisited eight cultural resources within or
immediately adjacent to the proposed project area. This includes five archaeological sites (41HR625,
41HR981, 41HR1098, 41HR1099, 41HR1140), two isolated finds (Isolated Find 1 and Isolated Find 2),
and one historic cemetery (Bogs-Hufsmith Cemetery).
Sites 41HR625, 41HR981, and 41HR1098 are previously recorded prehistoric sites which were previously
recommended or determined NOT ELIGIBLE for listing in the NRHP or for SAL status. SWCA found no
evidence at these sites to suggest an alternate recommendation and no further work is recommended at these
sites.
Site 41HR1099 is a previously identified prehistoric site. During the current investigation, no cultural
materials were identified on the surface or subsurface of site 41HR1099 within the project area. As such,
NRHP and SAL eligibility for site 41HR1099 remains UNDETERMINED; however, SWCA recommends
a finding that the proposed project will have NO ADVERSE EFFECT and no further work is recommended
at this time.
Site 41HR1140 is a previously recorded prehistoric occupation site dating to the Late Archaic to Late
Prehistoric periods. The site has been investigated by the current project and previous survey, testing, and
data recovery by HRA Gray & Pape. The site was previously determined ELIGIBLE for the NRHP. The
subsequent data recovery at the site by HRA Gray & Pape determined that the investigated areas of the site
did not contain intact living surfaces. The current investigation identified three loci of artifact
concentrations within the project area. These concentrations showed limited evidence of occupation and
lacked contextual integrity. As such, SWCA recommends a finding that the current project will have NO
ADVERSE EFFECT at site 41HR1140.

Isolated Find 1 is a single prehistoric chert flake and Isolated Find 2 is a concrete pad possibly associated
with agricultural or industrial activities in the late 1970s/1980s. Both were found insufficient to be
considered as sites and trinomials will not be requested. Isolated Find 1 and Isolated Find 2 are
recommended NOT ELIGIBLE for the NRHP or SAL and no further work is recommended.
The Bogs-Hufsmith Cemetery is an historic cemetery with at least 168 interments dating from 1911 to
present. NRHP and SAL eligibility for the Bogs-Hufsmith Cemetery is UNDETERMINED, as further
archival work would be necessary to assess the cemeteryâs potential to contribute to the understanding of
local or regional history. SWCA recommends surface scraping outside the cemetery area to ensure that no
unmarked graves extend into the proposed construction workspace. An easement in this area is currently
being transferred to Harris County; therefore, this work cannot be completed at this time. Once available,
the surface scraping will be conducted under SWCA oversight to ensure avoidance of the cemetery and will
be reported in an addendum to this report prior to trail construction.
In accordance with Section 106 of the NHPA 36 CFR 800.4 (b)(1) and the Antiquities Code of Texas,
SWCA has made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify significant cultural resources within the
project area. Properties listed or otherwise eligible for the NRHP, or for designation as a SAL, were
identified within the project area. With the exception of the pending further investigation of the BogsHufsmith Cemetery, SWCA recommends a finding that the current project will have NO ADVERSE
EFFECT on any significant portions of these sites under 36 CFR 800.5(b).

Early residents of what would become the Oklahoma settlement moved into the area in the middle to late 19th century. Families farmed,
raised livestock and used the rail station at nearby Hufsmith for shipment of local products. Because early settlers were interested in the
education of their children, they built the first Oklahoma Community School by 1880 with a $300 donation and property from the G.V. Leslie
family, adjacent to what would become the Oklahoma Cemetery. This one-room building was used as a school and church house. In July
1923, residents constructed a two-room school building on two acres purchased from John and Ida Hirsch for $90. It burned in 1930, and later
that year, the Montgomery County School District erected another two-room schoolhouse in its place, with A.l. Standard as contractor.
Students held box suppers to raise money for playground and sports equipment. Beginning in 1936, students in the seventh grade and higher
attended school in Tomball, and in 1944, all students transferred to Magnolia Schools. The schoolhouse never reopened, serving instead as a
community center and election polling place. Today, the Oklahoma School remains a focal point for the area, serving as an important
reminder of the early education efforts of the community's pioneer farm families. As the area's population continues to grow as a result of its
proximity to an expanding urban center, the historic schoolhouse reflects community pride, identity, and heritage.

This area of North Harris County was settled by Germans in the 1850s and was first known as Stuebner. Adolph Stuebner was the
Postmaster from 1885 until mail service was transferred to Hufsmith in 1911. The International & Great Northern Railroad founded the town of
Hufsmith in 1902 on property conveyed by the Bogs, King and Silas families, and it was named after company executive Frank Hufsmith
(1853-1927). A post office was established upon the arrival of the railroad; Henry L. Mueller was the first postmaster, and Fred C. Bogs
served as postmaster 1912 to 1951. The three postmasters are buried in Zion Lutheran Cemetery. The cemetery began as a family burial
ground in 1873, upon the death of one-year-old Bertha Mueller, daughter of Juliane and Wilhelm Mueller. Additional Mueller and Stuebner
family members were soon interred at the site, which was later known as Mueller-Stuebner Cemetery, Stuebner Cemetery, and Hufsmith
Lutheran Cemetery. In 1905, the Muellers and Stuebners and other Hufsmith area families joined together under the leadership of Pastor
G.W. Fischer to form the Evangelical Lutheran Zion Church. Henry and Mary Mueller donated approximately three acres encompassing the
already existing cemetery to trustees of the church in 1907. Numerous grave markers in the cemetery reflect birth in Germany, and many of
the marker inscriptions are written in German. Burials in the cemetery include those of veterans of the Civil War, World War I and World War
II. Although Zion Lutheran Church outgrew its 1907 building and relocated to Tomball in 1959, the church continues to care for the cemetery.

Paul Norval Bonin was born on September 2, 1814 in Fausse Pointe, Iberia Parish, Louisiana to Joseph Baron Bonin and Euphrosine Louise
(Borel) Bonin. Norval married Marie Coralie Hayes in Louisiana in 1835, and in 1852, the Bonins moved with several of their children and
approximately fifty other French families to North Harris County, Texas. Bonin purchased 1253 acres, including this site, for $1250 in 1857.
The Bonin familyâs property was located at the heart of the areaâs French settlement, and families such as Leleux, Melancon, and Pevateaux
were neighbors. A 500-acre parcel was sold to Norvalâs son-in-law Leon Leleux in 1859. Those buried here are descendants of Norval and
Coralie Bonin and their spouses and in-laws. The earliest known grave marker in the cemetery states that Ofelait Bonin, three-year-old
daughter of Joseph Telesphore Bonin and Marie Gertrude (Arceneaux) Bonin, died on September 9, 1865. Norval Bonin died in November
1868 and his wife, Coralie, died in February 1871; both were buried here. After the deaths of Norval and Coralie, the remaining family
property passed to the five Bonin sons who survived their parents â Telesphore, Oneziphore, Zepherin, Ernst Adness and Alcide â and each
received approximately 150 acres to farm. In 1987, Vernon Roland and Freddie Brill, together with other Bonin descendants, formed the
Bonin Cemetery Association to oversee care and preservation of the site. The Bonin family cemetery remains active, and descendants meet
each April to remember and honor their ancestors.
