Abstract
At the request of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD), Cultural Resources Program,
archaeologists from the Center for Archaeological Studies at Texas State University-San Marcos
conducted a cultural resources inventory at Lake Corpus Christi State Park, San Patricio County, Texas.
Field investigations were conducted between June 7 and 18, 2010, under Texas Antiquities Permit No.
5652. Carole Leezer served as Principal Investigator, and the field crew of consisted of Julian A. Sitters,
Robert Z. Seldon, Sarah Scogin, and Jacob Hooge. CAS archaeologists conducted a pedestrian survey
and excavated 128 shovel test units within the 368-acre project area. This cultural resources inventory
identified and evaluated five previously recorded sites (41SP116, 41SP178, 41SP202, 41SP227, and
41SP228), two newly recorded sites (41SP234 and 41SP235), and three possible Civilian Conservation
Corps (CCC) features (a water tower, a culvert, and a road segment). Investigations were conducted
with the goal of determining eligibility status for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) and designation as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL). Resulting data will also be used by
TPWD to address long-term stewardship and management of the resources, and to augment a detailed
resource management plan for Lake Corpus Christi State Park. Additional testing investigations are
recommended for sites 41SP178, 41SP228, and 41SP234 to aid in the determination of eligibility for
NRHP/SAL nomination. Site 41SP227 is recommended for SAL status due to the high likelihood
of current and future vandalism and looting at this site. The potential for the newly identified CCC
features to be recommended for NRHP nomination and for listing as an SAL is currently unknown.

Introduction
Lake Corpus Christi State Park is located on
the southeastern shore of Lake Corpus Christi,
approximately one mile north of the Seale Dam
(Figure 1-1). The park is
located on Park Road 25,
four miles southwest of
Mathis off State Highway
359, and 35 miles northwest
of Corpus Christi, Texas.
The park consists of 418
acres, 368 acres of which
are under lease to the
Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department (TPWD) by
the City of Corpus Christi.
This lease agreement was
negotiated in 1934 prior
to the construction of
the park by the Civilian
Conservation
Corps
(CCC), and will expire
in 2032. An additional
50 acres located in the
northern portion of the
park was acquired in 2002
and is owned by TPWD.
TPWD
contracted
with the Center for
Archaeological
Studies
(CAS) at Texas State
University-San Marcos to
conduct a cultural resources
inventory of archaeological

sites within the park. The purpose of the inventory
was to identify and evaluate new prehistoric and
historic sites and reassess all previously recorded

sites. Results from the survey will be used to
determine State Archeological Landmark (SAL)
and National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
eligibility status of any cultural resources.
Resulting data will also be used by TPWD to

address long-term stewardship and management
of the resources, and to augment a detailed
cultural resources management plan for Lake
Corpus Christi State Park. All project documents
and artifacts collected are curated at TPWD.

Environmental Background
Lake Corpus Christi State Park is located in
the eastern extremity of the South Texas Brush
Country, not far from the western border of
the Gulf Coast Prairie and Marsh Zone (Figure
2-1). Two geologic-edaphic habitat types occur
within the park. These are sugarberry-mesquite
woodland located above alluvial deposits, and
a mixed-brush shrub land on soils covering
limestone outcrops (Ralph 1997).

Coastal Corridor, including portions of the
project area.

Soils
As described by the US Department of
Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation
Service (2009), soils within Lake Corpus Christi
State Park include: Comitas loamy fine sand
(Cs); Delfina loamy fine sand (Dn); Papalote fine
sandy loam, 0–1 percent slopes (PaA); Papalote
fine sandy loam, 1–3 percent slopes (PaB); Pettus
loam, 0–3 percent slopes (PeB); Pharr fine sandy
loam, 1–5 percent slopes (PfC); Raymondville
clay loam, 0–1 percent slopes (RaA);
Raymondville clay loam, 1–3 percent slopes
(RaB); Orelia fine sandy loam (Or); Orelia sandy

Vegetation
The project area lies within the portion of
the Southern Coastal Corridor characterized
by terrestrial floodplains and adjacent prairies
(Mercado-Allinger and Ricklis 1996). Prominent
vegetation includes live oak, blackjack oak,
hackberry, pecan, mesquite,
and a variety of grasses (Jones
1982). Medium to tall grasses,
forbs, mesquite and acacia
are supported by the clayey
soils of the inland prairie, and
characterize the majority of the
project area. Sandier soils in the
northern portion of the project
area support live oaks, medium
to tall grasses, mesquite,
acacia, and spiny hackberry
understory
communities.
Natural vegetation of the
region is quickly succumbing
to land clearing and cultivation
throughout
the

clay loam (Os); Victoria clay, 0–1 percent slopes
(VcA); Willacy fine sandy loam, 0–1 percent
slopes (WfA); and Willacy fine sandy loam 1–3
percent slopes (WfB; Figure 2-2). Generally,
soil formation and subsequent taxonomic
classification/differentiation
depends
upon
climate, organisms, topography, parent material,
and time. Topography, parent material, and time
are the most influential factors for differentiation

among the variety of soils present in the park.
Parent materials of these soils are characteristic
of a terrestrial-marine water interface, or in
other words, the mouth of the Nueces River and
a fluctuating sea level. Ages of the deposits may
indicate the type and nature of the archaeological
deposits potentially contained therein. The mode
of deposition, alluvial versus fluviomarine, will
differentially preserve archaeological deposits.

Methods
A cultural resources survey of Lake
Corpus Christi State Park was conducted by
archaeologists from CAS between June 7 and
June 18, 2010, following guidelines established
by the Texas Historical Commission (THC),
the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA), and
TPWD. Approximately 368 acres of park land
were subject to pedestrian survey and excavation
of shovel tests to identify previously unknown
cultural resources. Previously identified sites
within the park were reassessed and their records
were updated accordingly. Locations of possible
CCC structures were also investigated.

surface inspection was conducted. With the
exception of revisited sites and identified possible
CCC structure locations, shovel tests were not
excavated in disturbed areas.
Shovel tests were excavated in 20-cm
levels to 40–60 cm below surface (cmbs), upon
which sterile soils were encountered. Soils were
screened through a ¼-inch mesh, and all cultural
materials were collected. Soil descriptions and
recovered materials were noted on standardized
shovel test forms. All shovel test locations were
recorded with a handheld Global Positioning
System (GPS) unit with sub-meter accuracy.
Temporally diagnostic artifacts encountered
on the surface during pedestrian survey were
collected and their locations were also recorded
with a handheld GPS unit.

Field Methods
In all, 128 shovel test were excavated within
the 368-acre project area, exceeding minimum
survey standards established by the THC and
CTA for project areas less than 200 acres. In
2002, Marianne Marek surveyed a 50-acre
portion of park (Marek 2002). The majority of this
previously investigated land was omitted from the
current investigation, as there is a low probability
of identifying any unknown cultural resources
within this area. However, archaeological site
41SP202, which was identified during Marek’s
survey, was revisited and reassessed.

Digital photography was used to document all
sites, including two general overviews of the site
illustrating the site setting (terrain, vegetation,
etc.). A photographic log was maintained and
completed in the field. Texas Archeological Site
Data Forms were completed for all revisited and
newly encountered archaeological sites.

Site Evaluations

Pedestrian survey transects were placed
and walked approximately 30 meters (m) apart.
Shovel test excavations were concentrated in
undisturbed, uncleared, and/or unmodified
areas. For areas that were disturbed by modern
construction and/or clearing, a cursory visual

Each site discovered or revisited during the
survey was evaluated for eligibility for SAL
designation with reference to the criteria in
Sections 26.7 and 26.8 of the Rules of Practice
and Procedure for the Antiquities Code of Texas.
If possible, they were also assessed for potential
5

eligibility for nomination to NRHP following the
National Register Criteria for Evaluation (36CFR
60). Additionally, each prehistoric and/or historic
archaeological site discovered or reassessed
during the inventory survey was evaluated with
regard to specific TPWD management priorities
and recommendations for TPWD management
practices. Resulting data will be used by
TPWD to address long-term stewardship and
management of the resources and to augment
a detailed resource management plan for Lake
Corpus Christi State Park.

(E) embodies
the
distinctive
characteristics of a type, period,
or method of construction,
possesses high aesthetic value,
or represents a significant and
distinguishable entity whose
components may lack individual
distinctions;
(F) has yielded or may be likely to
yield information important
to the understanding of Texas
culture or history.

Evaluation Criteria

The THC uses Section 26.8, Criteria for
Evaluating Archeological Sites, when assessing
the appropriateness of official landmark
designation, and/or the need for further
investigations under the permit process:

There are two main cultural properties
categories, historic structures and archaeological
sites, that are utilized in the evaluation of sites
for SAL designations. The evaluation criteria are
found in Chapter 26 Rules and Procedures for
administering the Antiquities Code of Texas.

(1) the site has the potential to contribute to
a better understanding of the prehistory
and/or history of Texas by the addition of
new and important information;

Historic structures may be designated as
SALs following the criteria in Section 26.7,
Criteria for Evaluating Historic Structures,
provided that the following conditions are met:

(2) the site’s archaeological deposits and the
artifacts within the site are preserved and
intact, thereby supporting the research
potential or preservation interests of the
site;

(1) the structure, or building is listed in the
National Register of Historic Places; and
(2) the structure, or building fits within at
least one of the following criteria:

(3) the site possesses unique or rare
attributes concerning Texas prehistory
and/or history;

(A) is associated with events
that have made a significant
contribution to the broad
patterns of our history;

(4) the study of the site offers the
opportunity to test theories and methods
of preservation, thereby contributing to
new scientific knowledge;

(B) is associated with the lives of
persons significant in our past;

(5) the high likelihood that vandalism and
relic collecting has occurred or could
occur, and official landmark designation
is needed to insure maximum legal
protection, or alternatively further
investigations are needed to mitigate the

cultural or ethnic group;
(D) is the work of a significant
architect, master builder, or
craftsman;

context, location, and condition to be considered
eligible. Properties are nominated to the NRHP
by the State Historic Preservation Officer in
consultation with the National Park Service.

Properties listed or potentially eligible for
listing on the NRHP fall under the jurisdiction of
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation
Act of 1966. The criteria for nominating properties
and determining NRHP eligibility is contained
in 36CFR60 (United States Congress 2004). The
NRHP evaluation criteria attempt to address
the historical significance of a wide variety of
properties, both historical and archaeological,
including places, structures, and objects as stated
in 36CFR60.4:

Assessment of Site Management Priority
Each
prehistoric
and/or
historic
archaeological site discovered or reassessed
during the inventory survey was evaluated with
regard to specific management priorities and
recommendations for management practices.
Each site’s research potential and suitability for
designation as an SAL and/or nomination to the
NRHP lead directly to its management priority
ranking, while each site’s susceptibility to natural
and cultural impacts were used to recommend
particular management practices. Sites that are
designated as SALs are ranked as Management
Priority 1, and sites that are recommended for
official designation as SALs and/or recommended
as eligible for listing on the NRHP are ranked as
Management Priority 2, in order to focus efforts
on preventing impacts on these sites. Sites whose
SAL status and eligibility for listing on the NRHP
are undetermined are ranked at Management
Priority 3, so that additional efforts (i.e., further
archaeological investigations) may be directed
at them. Sites that have been determined to be
ineligible for SAL status and/or recommended as
not eligible for listing on the NRHP are ranked
at Management Priority 4, and have the lowest
priority for management and protection.

The quality of significance in American
history,
architecture,
archeology,
engineering, and culture is present in
districts, sites, buildings, structures, and
objects that possess integrity of location,
design, setting, materials, workmanship,
feeling, and association and
(a) that are associated with events that
have made a significant contribution
to the broad patterns of our history; or
(b) that are associated with the lives of
persons significant in our past; or
(c) that
embody
the
distinctive
characteristics of a type, period,
or method of construction, or that
represent the work of a master, or
that possess high artistic values,
or that represent a significant
and distinguishable entity whose
components may lack individual
distinction; or

Laboratory Procedures and
Curation Preparation
A temporary field laboratory was established
at the project location and artifacts and forms were
accounted for on a daily basis. At the completion
of fieldwork, all collected cultural materials and
field forms were transported to the CAS lab in
San Marcos for processing and inventory. All
recovered artifacts were processed in accordance

(d) that have yielded, or may be likely
to yield, information important in
prehistory or history.
Buildings and structures generally have
to be at least 50 years old and in their original

with the TPWD Archeology Lab Manual, and
analysis was conducted during processing. All
collected cultural materials were prepared for
curation in accordance with federal regulation
36 CFR 79, current guidelines of the CTA,
TPWD Archeology Lab Manual, and with Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL)

guidelines. Processed artifacts were stored in
archival-quality bags and acid-free labels were
placed in all bags. Artifacts were individually
labeled and coated with PVA when appropriate.
Processed materials were then stored in acid-free
boxes with standard labels.

Previous Investigations

which recovered both modern/historic debris
and prehistoric lithic debris. While the presence
of a light lithic scatter suggested that the area
was once the locus of prehistoric activity, the
extensive land modifications and the mixing of
prehistoric and modern/historic debris led to the
conclusion that no further investigations were
warranted at the site. 41SP116 was recommended
as not eligible for SAL or NRHP listing.

Five archaeological sites within the
boundaries of Lake Corpus Christi State Park
were identified during previous investigations
(Figure D-1, Appendix D). These previously
recorded sites include 41SP116, 41SP178,
41SP202, 41SP227, and 41SP228. In addition,
Quimby McCoy Preservation Architecture,
LLP, conducted an inventory and assessment of
the CCC structures located within Lake Corpus
Christi State Park and prepared a report in
September of 2008.

A subsequent cultural resources survey of
four water well drilling sites within the park
by James E. Warren (1984) reassessed 41SP116.
The proposed location of Well Pad No. 2 was
surveyed in October of 1984 just to the north of
the 41SP116 site boundary. Survey consisted of
pedestrian survey and the excavation of “random
shovel tests” (Warren 1984). No evidence of
previous occupations was noted by either surface
inspection or shovel test excavation at the
proposed location of Well Pad No. 2. However,
due to the dense nature of the vegetation in the
proposed location and the proximity of 41SP116,
monitoring of construction activities at this
location was recommend (Warren 1984).

41SP116
In October of 1982, the Center for
Archaeological Research at The University of
Texas at San Antonio conducted a pedestrian
survey of a proposed well pad site within Lake
Corpus Christi State Park (Lukowski 1984). The
project location was described to be positioned
on a ridge that extended out into Lake Corpus
Christi, slightly north of the Wesley Seale Dam.
According to Lukowski, the area was cleared
of mesquite and prickly pear and extensively
modified to serve as a fishing resort camp. Three
standing structures or cabins were noted, in
addition to concrete foundations that marked
the locations of recent structures. Noted nonnative vegetations included mulberry bushes,
palms, and grasses. A light lithic scatter was
documented on the surface over the ridge
containing the proposed well pad site. Two shovel
tests were excavated during the 1982 survey,

In January of 1985, TPWD archaeologist
Ron Ralph conducted additional investigations
at 41SP116. Ralph (1997) concluded that the
historic component at 41SP116 was too recent to
be a by-product of the CCC and that it postdated
WWII. According to Ralph, the area was an old
park dump. Ralph stated that the area had been
bulldozed pushed and burned repeatedly in the

9

past. However, a triangular Tortugas projectile
point was recovered from site during Ralph’s
visit. It was recommended that the area be seeded
with rye grass to retard erosion (Ralph 1997).

modern well constructed with PVC pipe was
identified and believed to be associated with
former irrigation of the area. Due to its recent
origin, it was not classified as an archaeological
site. A lithic scatter of unknown age, designated
41SP202, was also identified. Marek states
that only a portion of this site is located within
the 50-acre parcel; the boundaries of the site
extend to the south into a wooded section of
park property. Artifacts encountered during the
survey of this area were generally located on the
surface and were noted as widely dispersed by
plowing (Marek 2002). While the portion located
within the 50-acre parcel was determined to be
ineligible for SAL or NRHP listing, the portion
extending southward was not evaluated. Marek
recommended avoidance of the site until the
entire site can be evaluated (Marek 2002).

41SP178
A historic foundation, 41SP178, was
discovered in November of 1991 by TPWD
archaeologists monitoring utility line repairs in
the Utility Camping Loop area (Boes 1991). The
concrete foundation was located in a small growth
of scrub 30 m south-southwest of Campsite No.
5. An inspection of the surrounding ground
surface uncovered brick, glass, and historic
ceramic debris. Four shovel tests were excavated
around the sides of the structure. These shovel
tests yielded historic debris consisting of brick,
glass, nails, mortar, and ceramics. TPWD
archaeologists concluded that this was a historic
site, and the location was registered with TARL.

41SP227
Archaeological site 41SP227 was identified
during an archaeological survey by TPWD
archaeologist Chris Ringstaff in 2007 (Ringstaff
2007a). 41SP227 was described as a Late
Archaic lithic procurement site and possible
open campsite. The site is located atop a gravelcapped point immediately south and west of the
park’s Depression-era CCC pavilion. Ringstaff
noted that the site is located approximately 150 m
east of the river channel, and its location would
have afforded a considerable view of the Nueces
River Valley. An Ensor point was recovered
during investigations, suggesting a Late Archaic
occupation. Additional recovered artifacts
included lithic debitage, biface fragments, and
tested cobbles. Ringstaff concluded that based on
the recovery of siliceous gravels, tested cobbles,
and debitage, the site appears to have been
primarily utilized as a lithic procurement site. As
the majority of the site lies within dense brush,
additional investigations of the area would be
needed to determine any additional function. The

A State of Texas Archeological Site Data
Form was submitted to TARL in November
of 1991 naming the site the “Farm House
Site” (Boes 1991). According to the form, the
structure appeared to have been destroyed by
fire prior to the construction of the camping area
and subsequently covered with dirt, leveling
its surface with the surrounding hillside, and
ultimately resulting in the protrusion of the
northern portion from the surrounding ground
surface. The form states that “a 1920s farm is said
to have been here but the whereabouts of those
structures has since been forgotten” (Boes 1991).
The site was recommended for preservation via
avoidance (Boes 1991).

41SP202
An archaeological survey of the 50-acre
addition to Lake Corpus Christi State Park was
conducted by Marek (2002). Cultural remains
were identified in two areas of the parcel. A
10

northern portion of the site was impacted by the
construction of the CCC Refectory Building in
1935, and the site continues to be heavily impacted
by a pedestrian trail that bisects it. Ringstaff
recommended additional investigation of this site
to determine its research value (Ringstaff 2007a).

Superintendent’s Residence, two Concrete
Benches at the Park Superintendent’s Residence,
a Stone Pile near the Park Superintendent’s
Residence, the Park Entrance, the Well House,
the Overlook, and six Culverts. The inventory
and assessment consisted of a description of each
structure/feature, an assessment of its current
condition, recommendations, and probable
construction cost summary. Photographs, GPS
location information, and historic drawings of
the CCC features were also presented (Quimby
McCoy 2008).

41SP228
41SP228 consists of a scatter of historicera artifacts and a prehistoric lithic scatter/
open campsite recorded by TPWD archaeologist
Chris Ringstaff in 2007 (Ringstaff 2007b). This
site is located in a cleared field within the south
camping loop, approximately 170 m northeast
of a fishing pier. Investigation of this location
included pedestrian survey and shovel test
excavation. The prehistoric component of the site
dated to the Archaic based on the recovery of a
Martindale-like dart point. Additional recovered
artifacts included lithic debitage, solarized
glass, whiteware, chert cores, biface fragments,
and mussel shell fragments. An area of dense
lithic debitage was noted by Ringstaff in the
southern portion of the site and may represent a
lithic reduction feature or overlapping features
(Ringstaff 2007b). Ringstaff recommended
limited trench investigations in this area due to
the presence of sandy deposits, which suggest the
possibility of intact buried features or materials.
In addition, he recommended further exploration
of the wooded section in the western portion of
the site (Ringstaff 2007b).

Cultural History
Previous archaeological research is limited
in the area of Lake Corpus Christi, where the
three counties of San Patricio, Jim Wells, and
Live Oak meet. Therefore, not much is known
about the cultural history of the area. The lake
itself was constructed prior to state or federal
regulations requiring archaeological studies.
The project area is located within the Southern
Coastal Corridor Archeological Region of Texas
(Mercado-Allinger et al. 1996). The cultural
chronology of this region includes the following
periods: Paleoindian (9200–6000 BC), Archaic
(6000 BC–AD 800), Late Prehistoric (AD 800–
1600), and Historic (AD 1600–1940).

Paleoindian
Sites dating to the Paleoindian period
(9200–6000 BC) are uncommon in the area, but
limited numbers of Clovis, Folsom, Plainview,
Golondrina, Scottsbluff, and Angostura
projectile points have been identified (Hester
1975). Occupations of the region during this time
are characterized as low population density and
small-sized bands with extremely large territorial
ranges (Black 1989). What few Paleoindian
sites that have been identified are located in the
uplands or on high terraces.

Inventoried/Assessed Civilian
Conservation Corps Structures
Fourteen CCC structures and/or features
were inventoried and assessed by Quimby McCoy
Preservation Architecture, LLP, in November of
2008 (Quimby McCoy 2008). These structures
and/or features included: the Refectory, the
concrete Water Tank at the Superintendent’s
Residence, a Road Remnant near the Park
11

Archaic

notched dart points are common for this period.
Late Archaic sites have been found in all settings,
including cemeteries along the coastline.
Subsistence strategies include the exploitation of
shellfish, fish, and small mammals in addition to
the continued use of plant resources (MercadoAllinger et al. 1996).

The Archaic period is divided into the Early
Archaic (6000–2500 BC), Middle Archaic
(2500–400 BC), and Late Archaic (400 BC–AD
800; Mercado-Allinger et al. 1996). While there
appears to be little information on the transition
from the Paleoindian period to the Archaic
period, evidence gathered from the area indicates
a shift in subsistence from big game hunting to
exploitation of estuarine resources (MercadoAllinger and Ricklis 1996).

Late Prehistoric
The Late Prehistoric (AD 800–1600) is
characterized by the appearance of pottery and
the use of the bow and arrow (Mercado-Allinger
and Ricklis 1996). This period is the most well
understood in the region. The transition to the
Late Prehistoric appears to be rapid, evidenced
by a shift to very small, expanding-stemmed
projectile points. The Rockport complex begins
in the region by AD 1200, and is defined by the
presence of Rockport pottery, which is a thin,
grey, sandy-paste ware. Other distinctive artifact
types and evidence of the Late Prehistoric
include beveled knives and small endscrapers,
and evidence of long-distance trade. Sites from
this period are common along the Texas coast,
with the majority of them located within 50 m of
a water source along bays, brackish water streams
leading to bays, and barrier islands (Black 1989).

The Early Archaic in this region is
characterized by the appearance of shell
middens, dart points, large thin triangular
bifaces, and beveled tools. Archaeological data
suggest that low population density with large
territorial ranges continues from the Paleoindian
period (Mercado-Allinger et al. 1996). While the
majority of cultural deposits dating from this
period occur in upland locations, some alluvial
and coastal sites have been recorded (Scott and
Fox 1981).
The Middle Archaic is characterized by
stemmed projectile points, medium-sized
triangular bifaces, and beveled tools in addition
to ground stone artifacts such as manos, grinding
slabs, and tubular stone pipes (Black 1989).
Middle Archaic sites are found in a greater range
of topographic settings, including along estuary
bays, further inland and upland, and alluvial
and tributary settings. This change in location
may indicate a shift in subsistence that includes
more plant resources. Increased populations are
suggested in this phase by evidence of large
interaction spheres as well as the presence of
cemeteries (Mercado-Allinger et al. 1996).

Historic
Several Spanish and French explorers,
including Alonso Álvarez de Pineda, Alonso
De León, Jean Béranger, Diego Ortiz Parrilla,
and José de Evia, traveled through what is now
San Patricio County. Mexican sheepherders also
camped in the area before the era of European
colonization. Colonization of the county begin in
1828 with empresarios John McMullen and James
McGloin, who contracted with the government of
Mexico to settle 200 Irish Catholic families on
80 leagues of land. The first groups of families,
recruited from the Irish population of New York,
landed at El Cópano and Matagorda in late 1829;

Large, thick, shell midden deposits are
characteristic of the Late Archaic and appear
to be more common and visible than at Early
or Middle Archaic sites. Small corner- or side12

two other groups soon followed. The colonists
proceeded to the east side of the Nueces River
and established the town of San Patricio de
Hibernia, named after the patron saint of Ireland.
In 1834, the colony was legally established as the
Municipality of San Patricio in the Mexican state
of Coahuila and Texas (Guthrie 2010a).

Gulf Pacific Railroad reached Mathis in 1913,
and a chamber of commerce was organized the
same year. Mathis grew as a trading center for
a large ranching area reaching into Nueces, Jim
Wells, Live Oak, and Bee counties. Ranching
and cotton and corn farming were the basis of
the city’s economy until the early 1930s, when
vegetable production began on a large scale.
The construction of Lake Corpus Christi on the
Nueces River four miles from Mathis opened
a new area of development in the early 1930s.
(Guthrie 2010b).

By 1836, 84 land grants had been made in
the colony, and about 500 people were living
there. The colonists eventually became engulfed
in fighting during the early stages of the Texas
Revolution. San Patricio County was established
by the Congress of the new Republic of Texas
following the Texas Revolution in 1836. The
original San Patricio County included territory
later incorporated into other counties. The area
was not really stabilized, however, until General
Zachary Taylor moved his army into the region
after Texas was annexed by the United States in
1845. By 1850, cattle ranching was the focus of
the local economy, with further changes resulting
from the Civil War. While far removed from
the main battle lines, the area became a major
center of cotton smuggling on the Cotton Road to
Matamoros, Mexico, after the Union government
imposed a blockade on the South (Guthrie 2010a).

The land upon which Lake Corpus Christi
State Park is located was leased from the City of
Corpus Christi in 1934. The park opened in 1934,
and many of the park’s facilities were built by the
CCC during the 1930s. Buildings constructed
included a bathhouse, park residence, and a
refectory, but only the refectory remains. This
Mediterranean-style building was built from
casts of local caliche. The blocks were cast in
various sizes and laid in a random-ashlar pattern,
closely resembling cut limestone (Steely 1999).
The 21,000-acre lake next to Lake Corpus
Christi State Park was formed by damming
the Nueces River. A reservoir called Lake
Lovenskiold was created in this valley in 1929 by
the construction of the La Fruita Dam across the
Nueces River. The dam was washed out the same
year it was constructed, and rebuilt in 1935 with
federal funds provided by President Roosevelt’s
New Deal. The name was then changed to Lake
Corpus Christi. In 1959, the Wesley Seale Dam
raised the level of the lake to 94 feet (ft) above
sea level and brought more lakeside development.
The new dam made Lake Corpus Christi one of
the largest artificial bodies of water in Texas. It
covers 21,000 acres, with a capacity of 300,000
acre-ft at the spillway elevation of 94 ft above sea
level (Texas Parks and Wildlife 2010).

Following the Civil War, ranching continued
to dominate the local economy, but crop
cultivation also began to take hold. In 1871,
Thomas M. Coleman and Colonel George
W. Fulton joined with J. M. and Thomas H.
Mathis in a partnership that formed the largest
cattle firm in Texas: the Coleman, Mathis, and
Fulton partnership, which held acreage in San
Patricio, Goliad, and Aransas counties. The
company flourished until an 18-month drought in
1878–79 wiped out much of its stock. When the
partnership was dissolved in 1879, T. H. Mathis,
who was awarded 64,000 acres of the firm’s
land, began plans to develop a town site, Mathis,
on his property. The San Antonio, Uvalde, and

R esults of Field Investigations
CAS archaeologists revisited and reassessed
five previously identified archaeological sites
(41SP116, 41SP178, 41SP202, 41SP227, and
41SP228). Investigators conducted pedestrian
survey and excavated 128 shovel tests in
undisturbed areas (Appendix A), and conducted
pedestrian survey and visual surface inspection
in disturbed areas. Appendix B lists artifacts
recovered from the shovel tests. Two new sites
were recorded (41SP234 and 41SP235). In
addition, three new CCC-era features (a culvert,
a water tower, and a road) were identified. State
of Texas Archeological Site Data forms, maps,
and site maps are presented for restricted access
only in Appendices C, D, and E.

Archaeologists from the CAS revisited
archaeological site 41SP116 during the current
investigation (Figure 5-1). The site is located on a
peninsula in Lake Corpus Christi State Park that
extends into Lake Corpus Christi. The peninsula
is characterized by dense vegetation consisting
of tall grasses, prickly pear cactus, mesquite,
blackbrush, brasil, and other thorny plants, as
well as two tall palm trees. Ground surface
visibility was less than 10 percent with exposed
surfaces consisting of sandy loam deposits.
While no standing structures were noted, the
remains of a shack or shelter consisting of a
large piece of corrugated metal sheet (ca. 5 x 6
ft) were identified. Its location was recorded
with a handheld Trimble GeoExplorer XT GPS
unit. In addition, five utility poles (Figure 5-2),
two metal barbeque grills (Figure 5-3), four

Revisited Sites
41SP116
Archaeological site 41SP116 was
originally identified as a light lithic
scatter during a survey of a well pad
site within Lake Corpus Christi State
Park by Lukowski in 1982. The site
was recommended as not eligible for
SAL status or NRHP listing. The site
was reassessed in 1984 by Warren, who
described the site as a lithic procurement
area and workshop. A prehistoric
triangular Tortugas projectile point
was identified in the area of 41SP116 by
TPWD archeologist Ron Ralph in 1985
(Ralph 1997).

(Figure 5-5), a windmill water pump (Figures 5-6
and 5-7), a concrete boat landing (Figure 5-8), and
the remains of a wooden boat pier (Figure 5-9)
were identified and their locations were recorded.
Four shovel tests were excavated within the
existing boundaries of 41SP116 (ST 68, ST 69, ST
70, and ST 71). All shovel tests were sterile of any
subsurface cultural remains; a single lithic flake
was identified on the surface of ST 70. Excavated
soils consisted of sandy loams.

of registered US patents revealed that this was a
patent for a pump invented by Daniel R. Scholes
registered on March 14, 1933.

41SP178
Archaeological site 41SP178 was recorded
by TPWD staff archaeologists in 1991 as the
“Farm House Site.” This site was characterized
by a weathered concrete foundation located along
the hill slope area between the shelter area to the
south and the utility camping loop at the northern
bottom end of the slope. The foundation was
visible within a small cluster of trees. Remnants
of brick, glass, and historic ceramics were noted
on the surface surrounding the feature during
initial investigations. Four shovel tests were
excavated around the sides of the foundation by
TPWD staff archaeologists in November 1991,
and all yielded historic debris that included
glass, brick, mortar, nails, and ceramics. It was

To include all the identified surface features,
the boundaries of 41SP116 were reassessed and
redrawn to encompass the entire southern portion
of the peninsula. While the surface features
appear to be of a recent nature, the actual age of
these deposits are currently unknown and may
date to historic times. The identified windmill
pump was manufactured by the Aeromotor
Company of Chicago and contained a patent

concluded during these first investigations that
these remains are the foundation of a domestic
structure. Boes stated in his 1991 State of Texas
Archeological Site Data Form that “a 1920s farm
is said to have been here but the whereabouts of
those structures has since been forgotten” (Boes
1991).

sterile soil levels were encountered. Artifacts
recovered from this shovel test included nails
and glass. ST 105 was excavated to the east of the
foundation and encountered the caliche bedrock
at 48 cmbs. Recovered artifacts from this shovel
test included charcoal and brick fragments. ST
106 was excavated to the southwest of the exposed
portion of the foundation to uncover the buried
portion of this feature, which was encountered at
40 cmbs. Recovered cultural artifacts from this
shovel test included nails.

The site was revisited and reassessed by CAS
archaeologists (Figure 5-10). With the exception
of a few sparse trees spread out across the area,
the slope area upon which the foundation is
located is absent of the natural surrounding scrub
vegetation. Ground surface visibility was less
than 20 percent with exposed ground surfaces
consisting of compact loams. The surface
area surrounding the exposed foundation was
visually inspected for historic remains; however,
only modern garbage debris was noted. Three
shovel tests (ST 104, ST 105, and ST 106) were
excavated in the area of the exposed foundation.
ST 104, to the north of the foundation, was
excavated to a depth of 60 cmbs upon which

A cement block and a piece of metal (possibly
associated with the cement block) were identified
approximately 75 m to the southwest of the
exposed foundation (Figure 5-11). The cement
block appears to lie even with the surrounding
surface and is not clearly visible. This additional
feature was recorded and photographed. A site
boundary for 41SP178 was redrawn to follow
the natural hill slope of the area that includes
the cement block, the piece of metal, and the
previously identified exposed foundation. The

located in an open field covered with mediumtall grasses with surface visibility less than
20 percent. Traces of a dirt road lie along the
southwestern edge of the open field and through
the southwestern portion of the site. The area
does not appear to have been plowed or irrigated
recently and the sandy loam soils were hard and
compact. Lithic debris (flakes, chert chunks) was
observed on the surface of the dirt road and in
areas where the surface was visible in the open
grass field. Locations containing visible surface
artifacts conformed to the site boundaries
recorded by Marek in 2002. Piles of mulch,
vegetation, trees, brush, building materials and
logs were observed along the dirt road and in the
open grass field. Two lithic tools (Scrapers A and
Utilized Flake B; Figures 5-13 and 5-14) were
recovered from a concentration of surface lithic
materials. These artifacts were collected and their
locations were plotted with a handheld GPS unit.
ST 124 was excavated to 50 cmbs in this area,
but did not contain any cultural materials. Two
additional lithic tools (Scraper C and Scraper

Archaeological site 41SP202 was identified
as a lithic scatter of unknown age by Marek in
2002. Marek contends that the boundaries of
the site extend to the southwest into a wooded

within the 50-acre parcel surveyed by Marek was
investigated in 2002. This portion was determined
ineligible for SAL or NRHP listing. The portion
extending southward was not evaluated during
Marek’s survey.

were observed, recorded, and
collected from the surface of the
cleared camping area (Figure

test, ST 77, was excavated on
the far northeastern boundary
of the site, but no subsurface
cultural
materials
were
encountered; only snail shells
were recovered.

A lithic scatter was
encountered and recorded along
the southern park road between
the south camping loop and the Refectory building
during cultural resources investigations (Figure
5-23). The site is located approximately 30 m
north of the interior park road and approximately
50 m from the turn off to the southern loop and
measures 23 x 10 m (193 m²). Fourteen shovel
tests were excavated in the area; eight of which

encountered during excavations of shovel tests
in the wooded area. The site boundaries of
41SP228 were extended to include the locations
of the historic/modern surface artifacts observed
within the wooded portion.

Several chert debitage flakes, however, were
observed on the surface of the cleared camping
area and appeared in a
dense concentration along
the top of the ridge that
extends from the northeast
to the southwest through
the cleared camping loop
area. A single shovel test,
ST 75 was excavated in
the densest concentration
of those lithic artifacts.
Prehistoric lithic materials
(n = 7) were encountered
and collected between the
surface and a depth of 50
cmbs. A complete amber
bottle
was
recovered
between 10 and 20 cmbs.

Cultural artifacts consisted of
lithic debitage and one tested

were encountered. Artifacts
extended from the surface to
a depth of up to 50 cmbs. The
site appears to be a prehistoric
lithic scatter and a TexSite form
(Appendix C) was completed
for this site. A more detailed
presentation of the analysis of
recovered lithic artifacts from
this site is presented in Chapter
6: Artifacts.

During investigations at
Lake Corpus Christi State
Park, archaeologists from
CAS revisited the Refectory
Complex area. The area and
associated features/structures
were recorded, photographed
and mapped (Figure 5-24).
Structures recorded included
the Refectory building, the
Grand Stair Case (Figure 5-25),
and the Pump House (Figure
5-26). Three shovel tests were
excavated on the grounds of
the Refectory Building; ST 98,

A feature that appears to be a
CCC-era culvert was encountered
during
investigations
along
northern Park Road 25 (Figures
5-27, 5-28, and 5-29). This culvert
is composed of cast calichecrete
blocks set in a random-ashlar pattern
(Steely 1999) similar to other CCC
structures located within the park.
The culvert extends approximately
14.4 m beneath Park Road 25 and
acts as a water diversion channel.
The northern side of the culvert
was investigated in detail and an
illustration was created (Figure
5-30).
The southern side was also
investigated, but only photographs
were taken of this portion of
the culvert as it appears to have
suffered some damage mostly
resulting from the direction of flow
of runoff water through the culvert.
The northern portion of the culvert
appears in pristine conditions as it
has been protected by overlaying
vegetation that was removed

northern side of the culvert is 90 cm wide
and 142 cm tall and the entire construction
of the northern side of the culvert extends
approximately 10.9 m along Park Road 25.
Its unique construction includes a key stone
above the entrances to both the northern and
southern culverts.
The newly encountered culvert appears
to be a previously unknown CCC feature
within the park’s boundaries. The report
produced by Quimby and McCoy did not list
this feature among those inventoried during
their assessment of CCC Structures in Lake
Corpus Christi State Park (Quimby McCoy
2008). The location of this feature was
recorded with a submeter handheld GPS unit
and plotted on a universal map of the project
area. A review of the CCC Master Plan map
of Lake Corpus Christi, clearly displays the
location of this recently uncovered feature
(Figure D-4, Appendix D).

Investigations of
Possible CCC Features
Water Tower
Investigations
at
Lake
Corpus Christi State Park
also included investigations
of a Water Tower located
approximately 170 m north of the
CCC Refectory Building (Figure
5-31). The Water Tower appears
to be similar to the concrete
water tower identified at the
Park Superintendent’s Residence
in the Quimby McCoy Report
(Quimby McCoy 2008:22). The
Quimby McCoy report describes
the Superintendent’s Residence
water tower as constructed
of poured concrete, standing
approximately 25 ft tall, and 10
ft in diameter. The report states
that the water tower does not
appear in the CCC drawings, but
its construction may date to the
construction of the residence in
1931 (Quimby McCoy 2008:22).

pedestrian survey as a structure (foundation) is
noted on the 1979 topographic quadrangle map.
Despite thorough investigations, no remains of
a structure were located. A “Y” road segment
was, however, uncovered during investigations
of this area. A shovel test was also excavated
next to the uncovered road segment (ST 120).
This shovel test was excavated to a depth of 50

cmbs through sandy loams. With the exception of
asphalt fragments that were recovered from the
top level, no cultural material was encountered.
As the road segment is not noted on the 1979
quad map, it most likely predates the late 1970s,
and may possibly be a CCC era feature that may
be evidence of the original park entryway as
envisioned by CCC planners.

Artifacts
In total, 455 artifacts weighing 3,448.2
grams (g) were collected during cultural
resources investigations of Lake Corpus Christi
State Park. Collected artifacts were classified as
building materials, 14C samples, glass, lithics,
metal, shell, and other (Appendix B). All artifacts
encountereded during the excavation of shovel
tests were collected, while only diagnostic
artifacts encounter on the surface were retained.
All artifacts were processed according to the
stipulations set forth in the TPWD Archeology
Laboratory Manual (Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department 1995). Collected cultural materials
were temporarily housed at CAS, with final
curation at TPWD.

collected from all levels of ST 88, excavated
approximately 10 m northwest of the identified
Water Tower feature. This may be indicative
of a burning event occurring in this location in
the past and/or the remains of burned tree and
associated root system. An additional 5.7 g of
charcoal were collected from ST 105, excavated
in association with the concrete feature identified
at 41SP178. The samples collected from ST 105
were from the upper levels (0–10 and 10–20
cmbs), and are possibly the remains of cooking
fires from the adjacent campsite. However,
previous investigations of this site state the
foundation structure was subjected to burning in
the past. Collected 14C samples were not subject
to radiocarbon or AMS dating.

Building Materials

Glass

Artifacts classified as building materials
included asphalt, brick fragments, calichecrete
fragments, and mortar fragments. The majority
of these building materials were collected from
shovel test ST 105, excavated approximately 5 m
to the east of the concrete foundation identified at
archaeological site 41SP178. A fragment of road
asphalt was collected from ST 120, excavated
adjacent to the identified road feature and a
fragment of calichecrete was collected from the
surface of site 41SP234, the CCC Complex.
14

Fifteen whole or fragments of bottle and/or
shaped glass were collected during investigations.
Two complete bottles were recovered, including a
small, amber, patinated medicine bottle recovered
from ST 75 within site 41SP228 (Figure 6-1), and
a machine-made, Ball art deco bottle collected
from the surface of 41SP234 (Figure 6-2).
The small, amber bottle is part of a throat
and nasal atomizer, known as the “Holmespray”
produced by T. J. Homes Co., Inc., in the 1930s.
A review of United States patents indicated
that design patent No. 92148 (embossed on the
bottom of the amber bottle), was applied for by a
Stanley J. McGiveran, of Toledo, Ohio, assignor
to the Owens-Illinois Glass Company of Toledo,

The recovered art deco style bottle contains
a script “Ball” maker’s mark on the bottom. The
Ball Bros. Manufacturing Company, also known
as the Ball Bros. Glass Company and after 1969
as the Ball Corporation, was headquartered
in Muncie, Indiana, between 1888 and 1996.
Originally located in Buffalo, NY (1880–1888),
this company relocated to Muncie in 1888 as a
result of the natural gas boom in the late 1880s.
Best known for its fruit jar manufacturing, Ball
also made a variety of other glass items for
the packaging industry. The majority of glass
containers manufactured by Ball carry the name
“Ball” embossed in cursive script either on the
side or bottom of the container, although some
fruit jars made during certain periods of time also
had the name in simple, block letters. The script
“Ball” was discontinued in 1988 as a result of their
merger with Indianhead Container Corporation,
resulting in the company name change to BallInCon Glass Packaging Corp (Toulose 1971). As
the collected bottle has a script “Ball” maker’s
mark, it is most likely manufactured prior to
1988. Its art deco style originated in the 1920s and
continued through World War II, suggesting an
early to mid–twentieth-century manufacturing
date. This is also supported by presences of
machine-made molds and the finished lip with
screw threads on the bottle.

Figure 6-1. Amber atomizer bottle recovered from
ST 75, 41SP228.

The remaining shaped glass fragments were
collected from ST 87, excavated approximately
8 m southwest of the identified Water Tower
feature, and from ST 104 and ST 105, excavated
adjacent to the concrete foundation identified at
41SP178. The fragments collected from the Water
Tower feature area included two clear glass
fragments and four clear fragments displaying
patination, while those collected from 41SP178
consist of both clear (four fragments) and amber
(three fragments) glass fragments also containing
patintion. Patination is a process of weathering
resulting in a decomposition of the glass surface.

Lithics

Some glass types are more prone to patination
than others, and some environments produce
patination more readily than others. The presence
or absence of patination does not imply anything
about the age of the glass. The process is also
known as staining, opalization, opalescence,
iridescence, or devitrificaiton (Dumbrell 1983;
Kendrick 1963; Tooley 1953).

In all, 158 pieces (581.9 g) of lithic material
were collected during investigations. These
materials were further divided into debitage,
cores, tools, and other. Lithic artifacts recovered
during investigations were assessed based on the
following definitions and attributes:
Cores—Cores are defined as chert nodules
that possess faceted platforms from which flakes
have been removed. Tested cores are chert nodules
with a single flake removed from an unprepared
cortical platform at one or more location on the
chert nodule.

Metal
Collected metal artifacts consisted of round
wire nails, with the exception of 35 unidentifiable
fragments (25.5 g) of ferrous metal. All metal
artifacts were collected from shovel tests (STs
104, 105, and 106) excavated adjacent to the
identified concrete foundation at 41SP178. Wire
or round nails are the most common used nail
in North America today. These nail types were
first manufactured in France between 1830 and
1855 by a semi-automated process. By 1855, the
process became fully automated. While some
of these fully automated wire nail production
machines were first exported to the United States
in 1873, this nail type did not become popular in
the US until the late 1880s (Sutton and Askush
1996).

Debitage/Flakes—The term debitage is used
to refer to lithic by-products of core and tool
production such as flakes and angular debris
(Crabtree 1972). Flakes are pieces of lithic
material that have been removed from a core or
tool through percussion or pressure. Debitage is
divided into flakes and flake fragments. Flakes
(proximal and complete), consist of all flake
debitage with a discernable striking platform or
notable point of applied pressure. Flake fragments
(incomplete and/or distal flakes) include flake
debitage that does not display a recognizable
striking platform (Crabtree 1972). Exterior
flakes (or cortical) are flakes with exterior cortex
resulting from initial tool reduction and primary
trimming stages of tool manufacturing. Interior
flakes lack cortex and are primarily produced
during the secondary finishing stage of lithic tool
production (Collins 1998). Non-flake debris lack
definable flake characteristics such as a bulb of
percussion and platform.

Shell
Collected shell artifacts consisted of the snail
shell of identifiable (Rabdotus sp., Helicina sp.)
and unknown species. In all, 104 snail shells (73.9
g) were collected during investigations. Shell
artifacts were examined for cultural modification,
but none was noted. No dense concentrations
of snail shell deposits were noted during field
excavations. While it has been argued (Malof
2000) that an analysis of snail shells will provide
data useful for dating methods, climate and
environmental reconstruction, and aboriginal
subsistence, further analysis of the snail shell
collected during this project was not conducted.

Tools—Lithic tools are chipped stone
artifacts that have been intentionally modified
or modified by use. These may be modified
bifaces, unifaces, flakes, or cores (Andrefsky
1998). Projectile points are modified bifacial
35

tools. Scrapers are specialized forms of unifaces
that possess secondary retouched edges,
resulting in edges shaped to a 60–80 percent
angle (Vierra 1998:119). Untilized flake tools are
distinguishable by the presence of one or more
edge of a lithic flake that has been modified either
through intentional retouching or through the
result of use (Andrefsky 1998:79).

indicating that they were culturally modified,
it is assumed that these lithic materials are
representative of chert road base once present in
this location.

41SP202
During reinvestigations of 41SP202, five
pieces (26.8 g) of lithic material were collected
from the site surface and consisted of one chert
flake and four lithic tools. Lithic tools were
further divided into scapers (n = 3; see Figures
5-14, 5-16, and Figure 5-17) and utilized flake
(n = 1; see Figure 5-15). No lithic materials were
recovered from subsurface contexts.

Other—This category contains lithic material
that cannot be classified into the above-presented
categories. The majority of this classification
contains non-flake debris. Non-flake debris is
characterized by a lack of both a ventral and dorsal
side, and it lacks a visible striking platform and/
or bulb of percussion (Andrefsky 1998:81). Nonflack debris is often referred to as angular shatter
(Andrefsky 1998:82). It is difficult to determine if
these lithic artifact types are the result of cultural
modification or natural processes without taking
into consideration the context from which the
materials were recovered.

41SP228
Ten lithic pieces (45.9 g) were collected
during revisit investigations of 41SP228. One tool
(scraper; see Figure 5-23) and one large flake were
collected from the surface. Two lithic debitage
flakes, three pieces of non-flake debris, and one
burned limestone fragment were collected from
ST 75 between 10 and 50 cmbs. This shovel test
was excavated in an area of dense concentration
of surface lithic artifacts. Two riverworn pebbles
were collected from ST 77 excavated at the far
northeastern edge of 41SP228. The low quantities
of lithic material collected from subsurface
investigations suggest that cultural deposits
in this area are shallow and may be subject to
erosion.

Lithic Artifact Descriptions by
Provenience
Nine pieces of lithic materials were collected
from shovel tests not associated with known or
recently identified archaeological sites. These
consisted of one tested core (ST 66), three chert
flakes (ST 05, ST 09, ST 70), and five pieces of
non-flake debris. The culturally modified lithic
materials (tested core and chert flakes) were
isolated occurrences and were not found in
association with other cultural deposits.

41SP234
Two pieces of lithic material (one lithic
core and one chert flake), were collected from
ST 99, which was excavated in association with
41SP234. ST 99 was excavated in a flat, cleared
area, approximately 20 m southwest of the
Refectory Building adjacent to the site boundary
of 41SP227. The recovery of these types of
prehistoric lithic artifacts from this location may
be the result of the location of the shovel tests

41SP178
Twenty-one pieces (23.9 g) of non-flake debris
were collected from shovel tests (ST 104 and ST
105) excavated adjacent to the identified concrete
foundation. Based on their context (found in
association with a historic/modern concrete
feature), and because they lack characteristics

debitage displayed cortex, while 54 percent
present was without cortex. This somewhat even
division of flakes with and without cortex does
not clearly indicate if this deposit is the result of
early-stage lithic reduction process. In fact, it has
not been clearly demonstrated in the literature
that flakes with more cortex are removed earlier
in the reduction process than flakes with less to
no cortex (Andresfky 1998:112; Mauldin and
Amick 1989; Odell 1988). However, the location
of this deposit in somewhat close association with
a known outcrop of siliceous/cherty gravels and
tested cobbles suggests some kind of relationship.
The recovery of three cores (two tested cobbles
and one core fragment) from this location further
suggests some type of primary reduction process
did occur in this location. This is additionally
supported by the absence of recovered lithic
tools, which may indicate a location of end-stage
lithic processing.

41SP235
In total, 29 pieces (222.5g) of lithic material
were collected during investigations of 41SP235.
Lithic material was further classified into debitage
(n = 24), cores (n = 3), and other (non-flake debris,
n = 1; riverworn chert shatter, n = 1). All lithic
material, with the exception of one tested core, was
collected from subsurface contexts. The majority
of lithic material (68 percent) was recovered from
depths between 0 and 10 cmbs. Fourteen percent
of the total recovered lithic material was at 10–20
cmbs and 20–30 cmbs. One flake was recovered
from a depth of 50 cmbs. These data indicate that
the cultural deposits in this area are also shallow
and may be subject to erosion.
Site 41SP235 is located approximately 380
m northeast of 41SP227, a Late Archaic lithic
procurement site and possible open campsite
located atop a gravel-capped point. The lithic
material recovered from site 41SP235, therefore,
may be the result of early stage lithic reduction
processes of cobbles and gravels removed from
site 41SP227. With this in mind, the collected
debitage flakes were then further delineated
into flakes with cortex (n = 11) and flakes
without cortex (n = 13). Flakes with exterior
cortex are believed to result from the initial tool
reduction and primary trimming stages of tool
manufacturing. Only 45 percent of the collected

Water Tower
In total, 82 pieces of lithic material were
collected during excavations associated with the
identified possible CCC Water Tower feature.
Sixty-four of these pieces consisted of caliche
gravels, while the remaining 18 pieces consisted
of chert pebble gravels. During a visual inspection
of the area surrounding the water tower, a pile of
chert stone road base was encountered (see Figure
5-44). The recovered lithic materials, therefore,
appear to be remains of a road base that must
have been present in this location at one time.

Conclusions and R ecommendations
CAS conducted a cultural resources
inventory at the Lake Corpus Christi State Park,
San Patricio County, Texas. The inventory was
conducted on behalf of the TPWD under Texas
Antiquities Permit 5652. In all, 368 acres of Lake
Corpus Christi State Park were subject to cultural
resources investigations. CAS archaeologists
revisited and reassessed five previously identified
archaeological sites (41SP116, 41SP178, 41SP202,
41SP227, and 41SP228) and recorded and assessed
two new sites (41SP234 and 41SP235) and three

CCC-era features (culvert, water tower, and
road). This inventory identified and evaluated
cultural resources to determine eligibility for
SAL designation and NRHP nomination. In
addition, each identified and revisited site was
given an assessment of the relative management
priority on a scale from 1 (highest) to 4 (lowest).
Sites were also given specific recommendations
for management regardless of management
priority (Table 7-1).

Summary

do, however, concur with the statement that the
area was not modified by CCC, as no CCC-era
features were noted during field investigations.

41SP116
Lukowski (1984) orignially described
41SP116 as a light lithic scatter with modern/
historic remains of a fishing camp. During his
1985 investigations, Ralph (1997) recovered a
Tortugas projectile point from the surface that
dated the prehistoric componenet of the site to
the Middle Archaic (2500 BC–400 BC). Ralph
(1997) concluded that the fishing camp remains
were too recent to be a by-product of CCC
construction and most likely postdated WWII.
Ralph (1997) stated that the area was used as a
park dump and has been bulldozer-pushed and
burned repeatedly in the past.

Due to the lack of subsurface cultural deposits
and the ephemeral nature of the lithic scatter,
the research value of the prehistoric component
is minimal (see Table 7-1). The use of this area
as a park dump and the resulting bulldozing
and burning have greatly impacted and most
likely destroyed any possible significant cultural
remains. Therefore, the site is recommended
as not eligible for SAL designation or or for
nomination to the NRHP based on the lack of site
integrity, significance, and its ability to provide
new/unique information. Site 41SP116 is classified
as a Level 4 site (Low Management Priority; see
Table 7-1), and no further management work is
recommended.

CAS’s reassessment of this site included a
review of previous investigations and additional
field investigations. A 1933 CCC master plan map
indicates that the area of site 41SP116 was within
the boundaries of the CCC park, but no structures
other than a planned road are discernable (see
Appendix D, Figure D-4). Only one piece of
lithic debitage was identified on the surface
during CAS investigations. CAS excavated four
shovel tests within the site’s boundaries, but no
subsurface cultural material was encountered.

41SP178
The “Farm House” site was identified by
TPWD archaeologists in 1991 and consisted
of the remains of what were believed to be
foundations of a domestic structure. While
historic debris (brick, glass, and ceramic sherds)
was recovered, no temporally diagnostic artifacts
were encountered. The site was classified as a
“1920s Farm House,” based on heresay about a
similar-type structure that once stood in the area,
but whose whereabouts are now unknown.

Based on the findings of current field
investigations and a review of previous
investigations and CCC-era documents,
archaeologists from CAS have concluded that
site 41SP116 should be reclassified as a multiplecomponent site that contains both historic
and prehistoric components. While previous
investigations dated the historic component of
the site to post–WWII, the identification of a
wind mill water pump with a patent date of 1933
suggests that the historic component may either
predate or be contemporaneous with CCC-era
construction in the park. CAS archaeologists

During the current investigations, shovel
tests excavated next to the foundation recovered
brick, glass, gravels, nails, and charcoal. A visual
inspection of the surrounding surface identified
a piece of metal and associated cement block 75
m to the southwest of the exposed foundation. As
no current boundaries of the site existed, a site
boundary was drafted that included the metal and
cement block and the partially exposed cement
foundation.

40

Archival research uncovered a CCC sketch
map that suggests a CCC structure may have once
been located in the area of the exposed foundation
(see Figure D-2, Appendix D). However, due
to the poor quality of the CCC sketch, CAS
archaeologists are unable to definitively conclude
that a CCC structure once stood in this place,
but believe that a strong possibility exists that
the “Farm House” foundation may be a CCC-era
structure.

material was recovered from the site’s surface
down to 20 cmbs. Artifcacts included numerous
flakes (some heat treated), cores, and two biface
fragments (Marek 2002). Marek suggested that
the site extended to the south into a wooded
section, although she did not examine that area.
Therefore, the southern boundary of the site was
not fully determined (Marek 2002).
CAS confirmed the presence of the light
lithic scatter within the previously determined
site boundaries. Four lithic tools (see Figures
5-14 through 5-17) were noted and collected
from surface context. A single shovel test was
excavated in the location of two of the collected
tools (Scraper A and Utilized Flake B), but no
subsurface cultural deposits were encountered.
A visual inspection of the surface of the wooded
area to the south of the site did not identify any
cultural deposits on the surface. Five shovel tests
(STs 107, 108, 109, 123, and 125) were excavated
within this wooded area, but no subsurface
cultural deposits were encountered.

CAS archaeologists concur with the
designation of the site as an early twentiethcentury historic site. However, the designation
of the site as a “Farm House” is questionable
due to the lack of supporting documentation
and the the speculation generated by the CCC
sketch map. Thus, CAS recommends additional
archival research to determine the nature and
prior use of the partially exposed foundation and
surrounding area, as it is possible that it may be
a CCC-era feature. The eligibility status of the
site is therefore unknown at this time, pending
additional archival research. The site may be
eligible for SAL designation and/or nomination to
the NRHP if it can be shown that the site is indeed a
CCC-era feature of significance. If the foundation
is a CCC-era feature, it will provide additional
information on the distribution and construction
of facilities at the park during this time. Site
41SP178 is classified as a Level 3 Management
Priority (Medium to Low Management Priority;
see Table 7-1). CAS recommends that this area be
avoided until the issue concerning the nature and
prior function of the foundation and surrounding
area can be resolved.

CAS archaeologists concur with the
designation of the site as a lithic scatter of
indeterminate age. Due to the negative shovel
tests in the wooded area to the south of the existing
site boundary, it is believed that the site does not
extend further into this region. Therefore, site
boundaries remain as they were drafted by the
previous investigation.
The research value of this site is low due to
the lack of subsurface cultural deposits and the
ephemeral nature of the surface lithic scatter
compromised by repeated plowing of the area
(see Table 7-1). The site is recommended as
not eligible for SAL designation and/or NRHP
nomination based on the lack of site integrity,
significance, and its inability to provide new/
unique information. Site 41SP202 is classified
as a Level 4 site (Low Management Priority; see

41SP202
Site 41SP202 was identified during an
archaeological survey of a 50-acre addition to
the park in 2002, and was described as a large
lithic scatter located in a plowed agricultural
field (Marek 2002). During that survey, lithic

recommended.

eligible for NRHP nomination due to its lack of
integrity and inability to provide new and unique
information. However, the site does appear to
be endangered by the heavily traversed trail
bisecting the site and may warrant the designation
of this site as an SAL based on Criterion 5:

41SP227
Site 41SP227 was recorded by Ringstaff
(2007a) as a prehistoric lithic procurement site
of indeterminate age and possible open campsite.
However, an Ensor point was recovered during
Ringstaff’s investigations that suggested a Late
Archaic (400 BC–AD 800) age. Additional
artifacts noted during the his investigations
included lithic debitage, biface fragments, and
tested cobbles. Ringstaff concluded that the site
was primarily used as a lithic procurement site
(Ringstaff 2007a).

the high likelihood that vandalism and relic
collecting has occurred or could occur,
and official landmark designation is needed
to insure maximum legal protection, or
alternatively further investigations are
needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism
and relic collecting when the site cannot be
protected.
Based on these conclusions, site 41SP227 is
given a Medium to Low Management Priority
(Level 3; see Table 7-1).

CAS archaeologists traversed the peninsula,
visually inspecting the surface of the site. The
site is bisected by a heavily utilized trail that
runs north to south from the Refectory building
to the shore line. While siliceous/cherty gravels,
tested cobbles, and lithic debitage were observed
on visible surface areas, no diagnostic artifacts
were observed or collected. No shovel tests were
excavated in this area due to exposed bedrock and
the lack of soil deposition. An area of possible
bedrock grinding mortars was identified, but
determined to be solution cavities upon closer
inspection.

41SP228
A multiple-component prehistoric lithic
scatter/open camp site and scatter of historicera artifacts was recorded by Ringstaff in 2007
(2007b). Ringstaff noted an area of dense lithic
debitage in the southern portion of the site
during his investigations. Recovered prehistoric
artifacts included, chert cores, biface fragments,
lithic debitage, and a possible Martindale point
suggesting an Early Archaic (6000–2500 BC)
age. Historic artifacts consisted of solarized glass
shards and whiteware ceramic sherds.

CAS concurs with the designation of this
site as a lithic procurement site and possible
open campsite. However, the inclusion of a Late
Archaic date should be added to this site based on
the recovery of an Ensor point during Ringstaffs
investigations. The current boundary of the
site was also expanded to encompass the entire
peninsula, conforming to the area of surface
artifact distribution noted during the CAS’s
investigation.

CAS archaeologists visually inspected the
surface area of the south camping loop, the roads
surrounding the camping area, the wooded area
to the north and northwest, and the areas just
outside the site boundaries. Three shovel tests
(ST 75, ST 76, and ST 77) were also excavated
in the area. Several pieces of chert debitage
were observed on the surface of the cleared
camping area, appearing most dense along the
top of the ridge extending from the northeast to

No further investigations of this site are
recommended. The site is recommended as not
42

the southwest through the camping loop area.
Several lithics were recovered from ST 75 in this
area. A cut bank was noted during examination
of the wooded area to the northwest of the site,
and two profiles were recorded. No cultural
materials were eroding out of the cut bank.
While no prehistoric artifacts were noted during
examination of the wooded area, three cement
blocks (one with an iron protrusion, see Figure
5-22) were observed and recorded in addition to
various non-diagnostic historic/modern debris.
Site boundaries were redrafted to include the
profiled cut banks and the observed historic/
modern debris.

Based on the above observations, site
41SP228 has been given a Management Priority
ranking of 2 (see Table 7-1).

41SP234
CAS revisited the Refectory Complex and
recorded, photographed, and mapped the features
and structures in the area (Refectory building,
Grand Stair Case, and Pump House). Three
shovel tests were excavated on the grounds of
the Refectory Building: ST 98, ST 99, and ST
100. An exhausted core and a large lithic flake
were recovered from ST 99, which was excavated
adjacent to the site boundary of 41SP227. A
complete, small, art deco-style bottle (see Figure
6-2) was recovered from the surface. A site
boundary for the Refectory Complex was drafted
to include the Refectory Building, the Grand
Staircase, the Pump House, and the excavated
shovel tests. The site was classified as a multiplecomponent site (historic and prehistoric). A
TexSite form (Appendix C) was completed for
this site complex and a site designation number,
41SP234, was given.

Archaeologists from CAS concur with the
designation of this as a multiple-component site
(historic and prehistoric). The inclusion of an
Early Archaic date should be added to this site
based on the recovery in 2007 of the possible
Martindale point. Further investigations of this
site are recommended to determine the nature
of these deposits and potential eligibility for
nomination to the NRHP. The site may be eligible
for nomination recommendation if further testing
investigations indicate it possesses integrity and
the potential to provide important information on
prehistory, specifically, Early Archaic occupation
and use under NRHP Criterion D. Additionally,
the nature (high visibility of lithic materials on
the ground surface) and location (within the
cleared, central area adjacent to the restroom
facilities of the heavily used south camping loop)
of this site compel the recommendation for SAL
status base on SAL Criterion 5:

Site 41SP234 may be eligible for nomination to
the NRHP under Criteria A, C, and D, contingent
on results of further testing investigations. The
buildings and structures of site 41SP234 were
constructed between 1934 and 1936 by CCC
Company 886 during the Depression era (TPWD
2010b). The CCC was established by President
Roosevelt in 1933 to protect land resources and
provide employment opportunities for the jobless.
This program was utilized by the State of Texas
to develop the core of its parks system (TPWD
2010b). Therefore, this site and in particular these
structures represent an important period and
event not only in the history of the United States,
but in the history of Texas and the development
of its park system.

the high likelihood that vandalism and relic
collecting has occurred or could occur, and
official landmark designation is needed
to insure maximum legal protection, or
alternatively further investigations are
needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism
and relic collecting when the site cannot be
protected.
43

The construction and craftsmanship of
the buildings and structures that are a part of
41SP234 are distinctive, displaying detailed
characteristics of CCC-era building techniques.
The primary building material is “calichecrete”
cast blocks. These blocks were manufactured
on-site and consist of 15 percent concrete and 85
percent locally quarried caliche. The blocks were
cast in various sizes, individually tooled to give
them the appearance of cut stone, and laid in a
random-ashlar pattern (Quimby McCoy 2008;
Steely 1999)). Additional character-defining
features include arched entries, short buttresses
flanking some of the arches, exposed timber
trusses, and a wood shingle roof with a clay tile
ridge on the Refectory Building (Quimby McCoy
2008).

observations, site 41SP234 has been given a
Management Priority ranking of 2 (see Table 7-1).

41SP235
CAS archaeologists recorded a lithic scatter
in a densely wooded area along the southern
park road. Fourteen shovel tests (eight of which
contained prehistoric lithic materials) were
excavated in the area and were used to define the
site. The site measures 23 x 10 m (193 m²). The
site was classified as a prehistoric lithic scatter of
unknown age, and a TexSite form (Appendix C)
was completed. A trinomial, 41SP235, was then
assigned.
No further research is recommended for
this site (see Table 7-1). The research value of
this site is low due to a lack of diagnotic cultural
deposits and identifiable cultural features. CAS
recommends that the site is not eligible for
nomination to the NRHP or for designation as an
SAL based on the lack of site significance and its
inability to provide new/unique information. Site
41SP235, therefore, is classified as a Level 4 site
(Low Management Priority; see Table 7-1), and
no further management work is recommended.

CAS
recommends
further
testing
investigations to gather additional information
on both the prehistoric and historic components
of this site. A more thorough historic and
archival study of the site will provide additional
information regarding CCC activities in Texas
during the Depression and on the early use of the
site as a recreational component of Lake Corpus
Christi State Park.

CCC Culvert

The site is also recommended for SAL
designation based on Criterion 5. This site and
its associate structures and features appeared
to be a popular visitor destination; several park
guests were encountered during the cultural
resources inventory at this location. Two of
the features within this site, the Grand Stair
Case and the Pump House, are in immediate
need of assessment and stabilization. Erosion
and landform weakening has compromised the
foundation of the Pump House and the Grand
Stair Case. This, coupled with the visitor use
and the potential for vandalism, lends itself to
concerns about site preservation. Based on these

During investigations, what appears to be a
CCC-constructed culvert was encountered along
Park Road 25 (see Figures 5-35 through 5-39).
This culvert is composed of materials similar to
other CCC structures located within the park. The
northern portion of the culvert appears to be in
good condition, while the southern side appears
to have suffered some damage, and attempts at
stabilizing the structure and adjacent bank with
concrete were noted. The culvert was not listed
by Quimby and McCoy assessment; however, the
feature is clearly indicated on a CCC Master Plan
Map of the park (see Figure D-4, Appendix D).

44

The culvert is an additional example of the
type of cast calichecrete block construction
employed by the CCC during the depression
era. Additional investigations of this culvert are
not recommended as this feature type has been
previously documented by the Quimby and
McCoy assessment (Quimby and McCoy 2008).
The NHRP and SAL eligibility status of this
feature is currently undetermined. It may qualify
under the same criteria as those proposed for the
CCC Complex (41SP234) or it may be included
as a component/element of NHRP/SAL-eligible
CCC-era structures/features located within Lake
Corpus Christi State Park. The feature, therefore,
has been given a Medium to Low Management
Priority (Level 3; see Table 7-1).

structures/features. The water tower, therefore,
has been given a Medium to Low Management
Priority (Level 3; see Table 7-1).

Road in NW Corner
The remains of a set of roadways (forming a Y
intersection) were uncovered in the far northwest
corner of the park during investigations. Asphalt
fragments were recovered from a shovel test
(ST 120) excavated adjacent to a portion of this
feature. The road segment is not noted on the
1979 quad map of the area and therefore most
likely predates the late 1970s. It may be a possible
CCC-era feature and may be evidence of the
original park entryway as envisioned by CCC
planners. This determination is inconclusive, as
this road segment cannot be clearly discerned
on the CCC Master Plan Map of Lake Corpus
Christi State Park. Further archival and possible
archaeological research is recommended to
determine the nature and age of this feature. As
with the above-listed possible CCC features, the
NHRP and SAL eligibility recommendations of
this feature are currently undetermined. It may
qualify under the same criteria as those proposed
for the CCC Complex (41SP234), or it may be
included as a component/element of NHRP/
SAL-eligible
CCC-era
structures/features
located within Lake Corpus Christi State Park.
The feature, therefore, has been given a Medium
to Low Management Priority (Level 3; see Table
7-1).

CCC Water Tower
A water tower located approximately 170 m
north of the CCC Refectory Building (see Figure
5-32) was also examined during investigations. As
the water tower appeared to be similar in design
and construction to the CCC-era concrete water
tower identified at the Park Superintendent’s
Residence (Quimby McCoy 2008:22), it was also
classified as a CCC-era building. Glass and road
base materials were recovered from the shovel
tests excavated adjacent to the water tower. A
pump house (see Figure 5-33), and a pile of chert
road base (see Figure 5-35) were also noted
nearby.
The research potential of this feature is
considered to be minimal beyond the inclusion of
this feature with other CCC-era features located
in Lake Corpus Christi State Park. As with the
CCC Culvert, the NHRP and SAL eligibility
recommendations of this feature are currently
undetermined. It may also qualify under the same
criteria as those proposed for the CCC Complex
(41SP234) or it may be included as a component/
element of NHRP/SAL-eligible CCC-era

Conclusions
Prehistoric Sites
Prehistoric sites and/or sites with prehistoric
components (41SP116, 41SP227, 41SP228,
41SP234, and 41SP235) identified during cultural
resources investigations at Lake Corpus Christi
State Park generally consisted of surface or

45

shallow subsurface lithic deposits. It is clear
from the distribution of surface lithic artifacts
and the geological formation of site 41SP227 that
this was once a prehistoric lithic procurement
site. Sites 41SP116, 41SP202, 41SP228, and
41SP235 may have been prehistoric occupation/
use sites; however, further evidence to support
this contention is needed before such a
designation can be determined for these sites.
The shallow ephemeral nature of the lithic
deposits encountered at sites 41SP116, 41SP202,
and 41SP235 rule out the need for additional
investigations in these locations to determine
the nature of these deposits. However, the
dense nature and somewhat deeper depositional
characteristic of the lithic deposits encountered
at 41SP228 suggest that additional investigations
at this location may reveal further information on
the use of the area in the prehistoric past.

41SP234 are warranted as an aid not only in
determining NRHP nomination eligibility, but
also to provide additional information regarding
CCC activities in Texas during the Depression
and the early use of the site as a recreational
component of Lake Corpus Christi State Park.

Recommendations
Cultural resource managers should not
consider all areas of the park covered by this
survey to be cleared for all future construction.
The purpose of these investigations were an
identification-level survey, with data collected to
be utilized in determining NRHP nomination and
SAL listing eligibility and future management
practices. Management recommendations and
recommendations for further work on each
individual site identified and/or revisited are
presented in Table 7-1 and discussed in the above
section. While several archaeological sites were
identified and/or revisited during investigations,
TPWD cultural resources managers need to take
into account the effects of specific construction
and maintenance practices on the sites discussed
in this report. More intensive investigations
may be needed depending on the impact of
park development or maintenance. Many of
the identified features and archaeological sites
within Lake Corpus Christi State Park are in
frequent and direct contact with park visitors.
It is important that all park visitors be made
aware of the significance of these identified
features and archaeological sites in the park, and
of the penalties carried for vandalizing them.
Archaeological sites 41SP227, 41SP228, and
41SP234 in particular have been recommended
for SAL listing based on the high likelihood
that vandalism or relic hunting have occurred
or are likely to occur at these locations. It is
recommended that all sites be monitored at least
biennially for evidence of vandalism or damage
from park visitation or maintenance activities.

Historic Sites
Sites and/or site components (41SP116,
41SP178, 41SP228, and 41SP234) identified
during cultural resources investigations that
can be dated to historic and/or modern periods
generally consist of CCC-era features and
structures. CCC-era construction within the park
has been clearly documented. Lake Corpus Christi
State Park Project SP-32 was developed by CCC
Company 886 on an initial 288-acre tract. This
tract was leased from the City of Corpus Christi
in 1934 for duration of 99 years. “Camp Kleberg”
was established on April 27, 1934, by the CCC.
CCC-constructed structures and features include
a concession building (Refectory Building)
designed by architect Olin Boese that was built
of cast calichecrete blocks, a dance terrace, a
calichecrete stone staircase to the water’s edge,
roads, bridges, two boathouses, a bathhouse,
and a residence (Steely 1999). A nearby dam
was constructed concurrently by the city. While
documentation on the CCC-era construction
activities exists, testing investigations at site

the surface (tortugas point). The area was described as a cleared area modified to serve as a fishing resort camp with 3
standing structures (cabins) and concrete foundations marking the location of previous structures. Previous
investigations also noted several prehistoric artifacts (bifaces, cores, and flakes). Current investigation noted a single
lithic debitage flake on the surface and numerous historic or modern remains consisting of concrete pads, boat
landings, shed remains, barbeque grills and windmill motor and water tank; windmill pump motor dated to 1933.

Discussion of Site:
A foundation or concrete stairs were identified; the foundation/staires lies horizontally and is under the surface to the
south and protrudes above the surface to the north. Previous investigations of the site suggested that the site is the
foundation of a 1920s farm house, but no documentary evidence is provided to support this. The foundation may
correspond to the location of a CCC structure identified on a CCC map of the area; see item # CC211 TPWD Lake
Corpus Christi State Park CCC files.

Basis for Determination: artifacts collected from 50 cm below surface
Artifactual Materials Present:
numerous worn/weathered flakes, tested cobbles, chert shatter/chunks, chert core and chert debitage/flake noted on
surface, but not collected
Discussion of Site:
Based on the presence of chert gravels, tested cobbles, and debitage the site appears to have been used as a lithic
procurement site. The majority of the site is located in dense brush, but were surface areas were visible, lithic debris
was noted. Artifacts were largely surficial as the soils are thin. An area of possible mortar holes was identified, but upon
further investigation, were determined to be naturally occuring solution cavities. The northern portion of the site was
impacted by the construction of the CCC Refectory. The site is bisected by a heavily used trail that extends from the
north to south, to the water's edge.

were encountered in the dense vegetation, but historic debris including cement blocks were recorded. These remains
appear to be the result of a historic or modern trash dump. No indications of any historic structures and/or features were
noted. An exposed cut bank in the densely vegetated portion was profiled. No artifacts were see eroding out of the
bank.

Cultural Features:
CCC Refectory Building (main component), designed by architect Olin Boese, a National Park Service funded
architect working for the State Parks Board. Building is made of cast caliche blocks laid in a random ashlar pattern.
The open-air building includes a large terrace, pavilion, lookout tower, and stage. Currently used as park offices.
Grand stair case also constructed of cast caliche crete block overlooking the lake at the tip of the peninsula and then
descends to were a boat house once stood (now submerged). Pump house on the westside of the bluff, also
constructed of cast caliche crete blocks, overlooks lake and acted as a water intake for park's water system.

core and large chert flake
Discussion of Site:
The site consists mainly of three structures constructed by CCC Company 886 between 1934 and 1936. The Refectory
building, the Grand Stair Case and the Pump House were constructed with locatly crafted caliche crete blocks set in a
random ashlar pattern atop low stone wall that protects the blocks from ground mositure. The building was designed by
