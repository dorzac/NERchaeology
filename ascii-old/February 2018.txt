From the Editor’s Desk

It’s 38 degrees at midmorning today. On these cold February days, it is nice to be cheered
by the thought of Scott’s report on gardens and gardening. In my several past lives, I have
had gardens from time to time, ranging from vegetables destined for the dinner table, including cabbage meant for sauerkraut, grapes and strawberries, to later years when I
turned to flowers and shrubs: three dozen rosebushes, plus daylilies, and tulips. Who can
forget the fragrance of those early-blooming hyacinths?
Now time and circumstances have decreed that I must content myself with a few houseplants, none of them edible, and none of them beautiful in the way that a perfect rose is
beautiful.
It is amazing to me that long-abandoned houses that historians visit will have three plants
blooming every spring: irises and lilacs in the yard and roses climbing over porch roofs.
My great-grandmother, who left Virginia for Colorado shortly after the Civil War,
brought a lilac with her. After nearly a hundred years, it still rose to the second-story windows.
There was a rhubarb patch near her house, and for all I know it still grows. Which bring
us, in a roundabout way, to Scott’s report on the gardens of our indigenous forebears.
Dock, the humble little cousin of the rhubarb, came with them from its home in North Africa, and still grows wild here. The Three Little Sisters of the New World, corn, beans and
squash, are latecomers to the Panhandle, and unlike the dock, must be cultivated.
So take heart, folks. In a few weeks temperatures
will rise again, and we’ll be saying, “I’ll be glad
when it cools off!”
Meantime, try to remember where you put your gardening tools, that package of seed, and the little jar
of Blue Emu. You’ll be needing them sooner than
you think!

PANHANDLE ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY
Minutes of January 17, 2018
The meeting was called to order by President Veronica Arias at 7 p.m. at Wildcat Bluff.
There were 15 in attendance.
PROGRAM: Alvin Lynn gave a slide presentation entitled “Pastores on the Canadian River”. The Pastores were
sheepherders who came from New Mexico along Comanchero and Cibolero trails into the Texas Panhandle during the mid
to late 1870’s. Pastore sites are scattered all over the Panhandle, but most were located along the Canadian river and its
tributaries. The settlements could be just single family locations or plazas with hundreds of residents, complete with stores
and saloons.
Alvin showed field trip photos from several Pastore ruins and the surrounding landscape. Some structures had substantial
rock wall segments remaining while others had almost disappeared. He discussed excavation work done at some of the
sites, and many interesting artifacts that were found. Some of the sites shown and discussed were: Salinas, Trujillo,
Chavez, Atascosa, and Borrego. Aerial and Google Earth photos provided additional perspectives. The Pastore era spanned
only the few years from 1876-1884.
MINUTES: There were no December minutes to approve since last month’s event was the Studer Banquet.
TREASURER’S REPORT: Treasurer Pam Allison reported a balance of $4385.64 for year-end 2017. Still pending is
reimbursement to Brad Jones for travel expense to Amarillo to speak at the Studer Banquet. Also, an Honorarium will be
paid to Friends of the THC in appreciation for Brad’s presentation. TREASURER’S REPORT: Treasurer Pam Allison
reported a balance of $4385.64 for year-end 2017. PAS will not be reimbursing Brad for any travel costs nor can he
accept an honorarium. However, if we send a donation to the Friends of the THC, then that will help fund the activities of
the THC.
PUBLICATIONS REPORT: Rolla Shaller reported a 12/29/2017 balance of $1,398.99 in the Money Market Account,
and $5,103.28 in the Certificate of Deposit.
OLD BUSINESS: The issue of where to hold our monthly PAS meetings was revisited. After a brief discussion, Scott
Brosowske moved that PAS meetings return to the downtown Amarillo Library. Alvin Lynn seconded the motion, and it
was approved by a verbal vote of the attendees. Informal pre-meeting dinners will resume at Napoli’s Italian Restaurant.
In the November 2017 meeting, PAS membership voted to pursue hosting the 2019 TAS Annual Meeting in Amarillo. As
a follow up to this, Scott Brosowske submitted a written proposal to TAS for PAS to host the 2019 meeting in Amarillo.
Per Scott, TAS has informally accepted the proposal, so the Amarillo 2019 TAS Annual Meeting is very nearly a “done
deal”.
NEW BUSINESS: Veronica Arias reported that upcoming meetings are scheduled between TAS and Palo Duro Canyon
State Park personnel about holding the 2019 TAS Field School in (or near) Palo Duro Canyon. Also, a 2019 TAS Academy (with an Archeology touring theme) is already planned for the Panhandle area.
Other upcoming events include:
Knapp-in and Artifact Show by Motley County Historical Society (Jan 26/27).
Center for Study of the American West (CSAW) Conference: “Shaping a Sense of Place on the Southern Plains” (Feb
21/22)
The meeting adjourned at 8:15 p.m.

Respectfully Submitted,

Andy Burchard, Secretary

PROGRAM INFORMATION
The Wolf Creek Indian Garden Project: Insights into
Native Gardening on the Southern High Plains
Scott D. Brosowske
Abstract
Experimental archaeology is a field of study that attempts to generate and test hypotheses, usually by replicating or approximating the feasibility of native peoples performing various tasks or activities. It makes use of a number of different methods,
techniques, analyses, and approaches. Previous archaeological investigations have recovered evidence for the growth of
cultigens by native peoples of the region during the Early and Middle Ceramic periods (A.D. 800-1400). To gain a better
understanding of the feasibility, as well as the challenges, of gardening on the high plains, Courson Archaeological Research
(CAR) initiated the Wolf Creek Garden Project in the spring of 2009. This long-term project utilizes several heirloom varieties of maize, beans, squash, sunflowers, and watermelons collected decades ago from several native communities. This
presentation presents the numerous insights, observations, and hypotheses generated by this project.

Biography
Scott Brosowske received a B.A. in Archaeological Studies from the University of Texas at Austin and an M.A. and Ph.D.
in Anthropology from the University of Oklahoma. Scott has been the executive director of CAR since 2005; he also holds
an adjunct curator position with the Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum at West Texas A&M University. His research
interests are highly variable, but include prehistoric and historic period adaptations to the environmental and cultural settings

of the Northern, Central, and Southern Plains.
