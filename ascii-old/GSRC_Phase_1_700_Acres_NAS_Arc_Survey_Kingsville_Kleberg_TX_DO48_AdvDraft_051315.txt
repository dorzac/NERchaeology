ABSTRACT
Gulf South Research Corporation (GSRC) personnel conducted an intensive pedestrian
archaeological survey supplemented with shovel testing of approximately 700 acres (ac) at Naval
Air Station (NAS) Kingsville, which is located southeast of Kingsville in Kleberg County,
Texas. GSRC conducted the survey for Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southeast
(NAVFAC SE) according to the work plan prepared under Contract No. N69450-12-D-0073,
Delivery Order 48. The project area was subject to pedestrian survey at 30-meter (m) (100-foot
[ft]) intervals and supplemented with the excavation of 300 shovel test pits (STPs) in accordance
with the Archaeological Survey Standards for Texas recommended by the Texas Historical
Commission.
GSRC conducted the survey on behalf of NAVFAC SE and in accordance with an approved
work plan prepared under Contract No. N69450-12-D-0073, Delivery Order 48. Dr. John
Calabrese of NAVFAC SE served as technical representative for the project, and Mr. Jeremy
Adams, natural resources manager for NAS Kingsville, provided onsite support and guidance.
GSRC personnel included Mr. Dave Hart, who served as the principal investigator and project
manager, and Mr. Dean Barnes, who served as field director for the project. Field archaeologists
included Mr. Steven Fullen, Mr. Brian Thibodeaux, Ms. Jenni Bivona, and Mr. Erik Haydel.
Fieldwork was conducted during two 10-day field sessions from January 5 to 14 and January 19
to 28, 2015, by Mr. Barnes, Mr. Fullen, Mr. Thibodeaux, Ms. Bivona, and Mr. Haydel.
The cultural resources survey resulted in the documentation of two newly identified
archaeological sites (Field Sites 1 and 2) and three isolated occurrences of cultural material. All
of the archaeological sites and isolated occurrences identified by this study represent late
Historic-era occupation of the Kingsville area. Field Site 1 is a late-nineteenth to middletwentieth century historic artifact scatter and Field Site 2 is the middle-twentieth century NAS
Kingsville airstrip built for propeller aircraft. The three isolated occurrences are a watering
trough, a porcelain electrical wire insulator, and a metal roof trestle with an unidentified metal
object. None of the sites are recommended as eligible for listing in the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) and no further work or consideration is warranted.

INTRODUCTION
Naval Air Station (NAS) Kingsville is located southeast of Kingsville in Kleberg County, Texas
(Figure 1). The NAS Kingsville main base consists of 3,180 acres (ac) of land, with an
additional 798 ac in aviation and other easements. In addition to the main base, NAS Kingsville
also manages four properties covering approximately 12,353 ac, which include the following:
Naval Auxiliary Landing Field (NALF) Orange Grove, McMullen Range Complex, Escondido
Ranch, and the King Ranch Relocatable Over-the-Horizon Radar (ROTHR) site. An Integrated
Cultural Resources Management Plan (ICRMP) was developed for NAS Kingsville in 2009
(Stokes et al. 2009). The ICRMP is âa plan that defined the process for the management of
cultural resources on Department of Defense (DoD) installationsâ (Department of Defense
Instruction [DODINST] 4715.16). The purpose of the ICRMP developed for NAS Kingsville is
to provide coordinated management of NAS Kingsvilleâs mission with stewardship of cultural
resources. The ICRMP covers a period of 5 years and has the following goals:
ï·
ï·
ï·
ï·
ï·
ï·

Provide an assessment of the health of the installationâs cultural resources program
Present a summary of known information about cultural resources on the installation and
identify gaps in data
Outline standard procedures to address common situations relating to cultural resources
Serve as a toolbox for Cultural Resources Managers (CRMs) on how to apply various
statutes, regulations, and guidance relating to cultural resources management
Address concerns and requirements of internal and external stakeholders
Serve as the institutional memory about the cultural resources program

Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southeast (NAVFAC SE) issued a Naval Resources
Environmental Technical Services Contract (N69450-12-D-0073, Delivery Order 0048) to
GSRC to conduct an intensive pedestrian archaeological survey of 700 ac supplemented with up
to 300 shovel tests for previously unsurveyed portions of NAS Kingsville (Figure 2). By
inventorying NAS Kingsville-managed property for cultural resource potential and identifying
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) potentially eligible properties well in advance of
proposed actions, NAS Kingsville not only takes efforts to address Section 110, but also has the
potential to limit efforts necessary for Section 106 compliance in the future. No immediate
undertaking is proposed that would disturb the present context of the areas under this
investigation.
All work conformed to guidelines set forth by the Texas Historical Commission (THC) and was
conducted in compliance with the U.S. Navy Executive Order (USNEO) 11593 Protection and
Enhancement of the Cultural Environment, the Standard Operating Procedure #3 National
Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) Section 110 Compliance identified in the Naval Air Station
Kingsville Integrated Cultural Resources Management Plan FY 2009-2014 (Stokes et al. 2009),
and the Secretary of Interiorâs Guidelines for Local Surveys: A Basis for Preservation Planning
(Derry et al. 1977). All work conducted under Delivery Order 0048 was conducted in
accordance with Section 2.8 (Cultural Resources Technical Requirements), particularly sections
2.8.1.1 (Terrestrial Archaeological Survey â Pedestrian), 2.8.7.9 (Artifact Shipment), 2.8.8.2
(Shovel Test Pit, Multiple), 2.8.2.3 (Historic Resources Evaluation), and all appropriate sections
of the contract.

Reporting Conventions
Cultural resources specialists typically express measurements using the metric system when
reporting on indigenous archaeological sites (e.g., meters [m] and centimeters [cm]) and English
measurements when discussing non-indigenous properties (e.g., feet [ft] and inches [in]).
Measurements derived from U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) maps or other sources in which
English measurements are used are given only in English dimensions. Thus, distances are given
in miles (mi) and elevations in ft with metric conversions. The dimensions of surveyed areas are
expressed in acres. Metric-English conversions are provided for clarity, where appropriate.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Geography
Kleberg County is located in the Gulf Coast Prairie Region of Texas and lies on the mainland, as
well as on Padre Island (United States Fish and Wildlife Servive [USFWS] 2010:9). Kleberg
County is bounded on the western border by Jim Wells County, Kenedy County to the south,
Nueces County to the north, and Brooks County to the southwest. The county covers a total area
of 1,090 square miles (mi2), of which 853 mi2 lie on the mainland, with the remaining being split
between 18 mi2 on Padre Island and 219 mi2 of water. The terrain is generally flat with
elevations ranging from sea level to 150 ft (45 m) above sea level. Several creeks dissect the
county, including the San Fernando, Santa Gertrudis, Escondido, and Los Olmos, which flow
into the Cayo del Grullo and Baffin Bay (Coalson 2010).
Climate
The climate of Kleberg County is humid-subtropical with an average minimum temperature of
8.9Âº Celsius (C) (48Âº Fahrenheit [F]) in January and an average high temperature of 35.6Âº C
(96Âº F) in July. The growing season averages 314 days a year, and the average annual
precipitation is 26.5 in (67.3 cm) (Coalson 2010).
Geology and Soils
The project area lies within the Pleistocene Beaumont Formation (Barnes 1975) (Figure 3). The
geologic units encompassing the survey area are described as predominantly clay and mud of
low permeability with a high to very high shrink-swell potential. These units generally include
interdistributary muds, abandoned channel-fill muds, and fluvial overbank muds. Soils within
the survey area consist of Banquete clays (BbA), Calallen sandy clay loams (CaA), Crannel
sandy clay loams (CnA), Gertrudis fine sandy loams (GeB), Gullied land-Riverwash complex
(GRE), and Victoria clay (VcA and VcB) (Figure 4) (United States Department of Agricultural
[USDA], Natural Resources Conservation Service [NRCS] 2012). The soils within the survey
area are predominantly Victoria clay (VcA) (75 percent) and Crannel sandy clay loam (CnA) (20
percent). Subsoil varies in depth from 15 to 43 centimeters below ground surface (cmbs) (6 to
17 inches below ground surface [inbs]).
The Banquete series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils
that formed in clayey fluviomarine sediments derived from the Beaumont Formation of Late
Pleistocene age. These soils are nearly level and found in open-ended shallow depressions and
swales on flat plains of the South Texas Coastal Plain (USDA, NRCS 2012). A typical pedon
for Banquete series soils consists of an A horizon from 0 to 15 cmbs (0 to 6 inbs) of black (10YR
2/1) (black [10YR 2/1] dry) clay. This is followed by a Bss horizon from 15 to 53 cmbs (6 to 21
inbs) of black (10YR 2/1) (black [10YR 2/1] dry) clay. A Bkss1 horizon extends from 53 to 71
cmbs (21 to 28 inbs) consisting of a very dark gray (10YR 3/1) (dark gray [10YR 4/1] dry) clay,
a Bkss2 horizon extending from 71 to 89 cmbs (21 to 35 inbs) consisting of a gray (10YR 5/1)
(gray [10YR 5/1] dry) clay, and a Bkss3 horizon extending from 89 to 112 cmbs (35 to 44 inbs)
consisting of a gray (2.5Y 6/1) (gray [10YR 6/1] dry) clay. A Bk horizon extends from 112 to
142 cmbs (44 to 56 inbs) consisting of a light gray (10YR 7/1) (light gray [2.5Y 7/1] dry) clay
loam (Haile and Brezina 2012).

Cranell series soils consist of very deep, well drained, and slowly permeable soils that are found
on flats. The soils are formed in loamy and clayey sediments of middle to late Pleistocene age.
A typical pedon of Cranell series soils has an A horizon from 0 to 25 cmbs (0 to 10 inbs)
consisting of a black (10YR 2/1) sandy clay loam. This is followed by two Bt horizons
consisting of a Bt1 horizon from 25 to 56 cmbs (10 to 22 inbs) of black (10YR 2/1) sandy clay
and a Bt2 horizon from 56 to 74 cmbs (22 to 29 inbs) consisting of a very dark gray (10YR 3/1)
sandy clay. This is followed by a Btk horizon from 74 to 109 cmbs (29 to 43 inbs) consisting of
a dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy clay. This is followed by two Bk horizons consisting of
a Bk1 horizon of pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy clay loam from 109 to 147 cmbs (43 to 58 inbs)
and a Bk2 horizon of pale yellow (2.5Y 7/3) sandy clay loam from 147 to 203 cmbs (58 to 80
inbs) (Haile and Brezina 2012).
The Calallen Series soils consist of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that are
formed in loamy fluviomarine sediments in the Beaumont Formation of Late Pleistocene-age.
They are nearly level and occur on flats on the South Texas Plain (Haile and Brezina 2012). A
typical pedon has an Ap horizon from 0 to 20 cmbs (0 to 8 inbs) consisting of a very dark gray
(10YR 3/1) (dark gray [10YR 4/1] dry) sandy clay loam. This is followed by a Bt1 horizon from
20 to 36 cmbs (8 to 14 inbs) consisting of a very dark gray (10YR 3/1) (very dark gray [10YR
3/1] dry) sandy clay loam, a Bt2 horizon from 36 to 66 cmbs (14 to 26 inbs) consisting of a very
dark gray (10YR 3/1) (very dark gray [10YR 3/1] dry) sandy clay loam, and a Bt3 horizon from
66 to 97 cmbs (26 to 38 inbs) consisting of a dark gray (10YR 4/1) and dark grayish brown
(10YR 4/2) (dark gray [10YR 4/1] and grayish brown [10YR 5/2] dry) sandy clay loam. This is
followed by a Btk1 horizon from 97 to 142 cmbs (38 to 56 inbs) consisting of a grayish brown
(10YR 5/2) (light brownish gray [10YR 6/2] dry) sandy clay loam, a Btk2 horizon from 142 to
168 cmbs (56 to 66 inbs) consisting of a pale yellow (2.5Y 7/3) (very pale brown [10YR 7/4]
dry) sandy clay loam, and a Btk3 horizon from 168 to 203 cmbs (66 to 88 inbs) consisting of a
very pale brown (10YR 7/3) (very pale brown [10YR 8/3] dry) sandy clay loam (Haile and
Brezina 2012).
Gertrudis series soils consist of very deep, moderately permeable, and well-drained soils found
on erosional terrace remnants. The soils have formed from Aeolian deposits over Quaternaryage calcareous loamy alluvium. A typical pedon for Gertrudis series soils consists of an A1
horizon of very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) (dark grayish brown [10YR 4/2] dry) fine sandy
loam from 0 to 18 cmbs (0 to 7 inbs) and an A2 horizon from 18 to 43 cmbs (7 to 17 inbs)
consisting of a very dark brown (10YR 2/2) (very dark grayish brown [10YR 3/2] dry) very fine
sandy loam. This is followed by 2 Bk horizons consisting of a Bk1 horizon of dark grayish
brown (10YR 4/2) (grayish brown [10YR 6/2] dry) sandy clay loam from 43 to 64 cmbs (17 to
25 inbs) and a Bk2 horizon from 64 to 102 cmbs (25 to 40 inbs) consisting of a grayish brown
(10YR 5/2) (light brownish gray [10YR 6/2] dry) sandy clay loam. This is followed by three
buried Bk horizons which is interpreted to represent the Quaternary-age alluvium deposits
consisting of a 2Bk1 horizon from 102 to 127 cmbs (40 to 50 inbs) of pale brown (10YR 6/3)
(pale brown [10YR 6/3] dry) clay loam, a 2Bk2 horizon from 127 to 173 cmbs (50 to 68 inbs)
consisting of a pale brown (10YR 6/3) (light gray [10YR 7/2] dry) clay loam, and a 2Bk3
horizon from 173 to 203 cmbs (68 to 80 inbs) consisting of a light brownish gray (10YR 6/2)
(light gray [10YR 7/2] dry) loam (Haile and Brezina 2012).

The Gullied land-Riverwash complex consists predominantly of Riverwash and similar soils (55
percent) and Gullied land and similar soils (35 percent). Riverwash typically occurs on
floodplains within the Coastal Plain. It consists of loamy and clayey alluvial sediments of
Holocene age. Gullied land is similarly found on Coastal Plains and consists of loamy and
clayey alluvial sediments. Typical pedons or profiles are not provided for either of these soil
types/series by the USDA (Haile and Brezina 2012).
The Victoria series consists of dark, calcareous, crumbly soils that crack when they dry and swell
and take in water slowly when they are wet. Victoria clays are a vertisol whose parent materials
are clayey fluviomarine deposits of Late Pleistocene age. Victoria series soils have a typical
pedon consisting of an Ap horizon from 0 to 15 cmbs (0 to 6 inbs) of black (10YR 2/1) (very
dark gray [10YR 3/1] dry) clay. This is followed by two Bss horizons consisting of a Bss1
horizon of very dark gray (10YR 3/1) (very dark gray [10YR 3/1] dry) clay from 15 to 61 cmbs
(6 to 24 inbs) and a Bss2 horizon from 61 to 94 cmbs (24 to 37 inbs) consisting of a very dark
gray (10YR 3/1) (very dark gray [10YR 3/1] dry) clay. This is followed by a Bnss horizon from
94 to 127 cmbs (37 to 50 inbs) consisting of a pale brown (10YR 6/3) (pale brown [10YR 6/3]
dry) clay. This is followed by two Bkny horizons consisting of a Bkny1 horizon from 127 to 157
cmbs (50 to 62 inbs) composed of a very pale brown (10YR 7/3) (pale yellow [2.5Y 7/3] dry)
clay and a Bkny2 horizon from 157 to 203 cmbs (62 to 80 inbs) composed of a very pale brown
(10YR 7/3) (pale yellow [2.5Y 8/3] dry) clay (Haile and Brezina 2012).
Flora and Fauna
The project location is situated within the Gulf Coast Prairie Region (USFWS 2010, 2011;
United States Geological Survey [USGS] 2013). Common vegetation includes honey mesquite
(Prosopis glandulosa), sugarberry (Celtis laevigata), wax myrtle (Myrica cerifera), dwarf
palmetto (Sabal minor), lantana (Lantana camara), inland seaoats (Chasmanthium latifolium),
big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii), and Gulf cordgrass (Spartina spartinae) (USGS 2013).
South Texas ambrosia (Ambrosia cheiranthifolia), a Federally endangered plant, is known to
occur at 28 sites within Kleberg and Nueces counties, including in and around Kingsville. South
Texas ambrosia is an herbaceous ashy, blue-gray rhizomatous perennial in the Asteraceae
(sunflower) family. Erect stems are 3.9 to 23.8 in tall. The number of plants present is difficult
to count, as they usually form closely spaced colonies with rhizomatous growth habits inhibiting
number counts. The leaves are usually opposite at the base, and alternate above. The leaves are
mostly oblanceolate 0.8 to 2.8 in long, with the blade narrowing gradually at the base. Leaves
are mostly unlobed and entire, although the lower and larger leaves of juvenile plants may be
undulate or shallowly pinnate. Leaves appear whitened due to a fine and short appressed
pubescence, giving the leaf an ashy blue-gray color. The inflorescence is usually unbranched
and composed of separate male and female flowers. The male flowers occur in a terminal
raceme 2 to 4 in long composed of 10 to 12 small, light yellow, saucer-shaped flowers that are
about 0.16 in wide and have four to six acute, triangular lobes. The female flowers are in small
clusters in the axils of the leaves. The fruit is an achene, somewhat angled and long with a stout
beak. The fruit has four to five blunt spines spread across the surface (Correll and Johnston
1970; Jones 1977). South Texas ambrosia is distinguished from related species within its
geographical range by its simple leaves and the ashy blue-gray color; however, this species is
easily obscured by taller native and introduced grasses (Turner 1983).

South Texas ambrosia grows at low elevations (less than 66 ft above mean sea level) in open
prairies and savannas of south Texas, on soils varying from clay loams to sandy loams. Within
the Gulf Coastal grasslands, it inhabits clay soils derived primarily from the Beaumont clay
series (Turner 1983). This soil is typically clay loam to sandy loam, usually deep clay soils and
occasionally on windblown clay dunes along streams. Given the known presence of south Texas
ambrosia in and around Kingsville, specific measures for avoidance of this endangered species
will be implemented. This includes all technicians being familiar with the identification of the
plant and not excavating shovel tests within the vicinity of the plant.
Wildlife commonly associated with this ecoregion include white-winged dove (Zenaida
asiatica), red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamacaiensis), common grackle (Quiscalus quiscula), coyote
(Canis latrans), raccoon (Procyon lotor), rats (Genera Rattus, Sigmodon, Orozomys), Texas rat
snake (Elaphe obsoleta lindhiemeri), Texas horned lizard (Phrynosoma cornutum), and Gulf
Coast toad (Rana valliceps) (USGS 2013).
Paleoenvironment
The paleoenvironment of the area during the Wisconsin Glacial Episode (87,000 to 14,000 years
Before Present [B.P.]) was considerably cooler and more humid than today. The area was
thought to be covered by grasslands, woodlands, and parklands including species of pine
(Pinus spp.) and spruce (Picea spp.) that are predominantly found today in much cooler
environments. A change to the current Holocene environmental conditions began around 10,000
B.P., though there is some debate over timing and nature of the change, with some suggesting a
gradual trend toward warmer and drier conditions over time and others suggesting that the
climate fluctuated throughout the Holocene between drier and wetter conditions (Black 1989a;
Ricklis 2004). Although there is not complete agreement on the timing of the Holocene sea-level
rise, there is a general consensus that marine transgression was stepwise, with periods of rapid
rise interrupted by intervals of markedly slowed rise, slight regression, or sea-level stillstand
(Ricklis 2004).
More recent research by Albert (2006) reconstructed the vegetational history of the Central
Texas Coast utilizing pollen data from marsh sediments at Swan Lake on Copano Bay, as well as
supporting sequences from Nueces Bay and the Lower Guadalupe River Valley. Three periods
of marine influence were identified at Swan Lake, first at 7100 B.P., then at 4900 B.P., and
finally at 3450 B.P., each of which are defined by high levels of Chenopodiaceae pollen. The
presence of Avicennia pollen in the initial period of marine influence, and in lesser
concentrations in the latter two periods of marine influence, is suggestive of a connection
between higher sea levels and warmer climates in the Gulf region. Comparison of the pollen
samples collected at Swan Lake to samples collected from a black mangrove swamp near Bahia
Grande in the Rio Grande Delta indicate that a warmer climate approximating that of the Rio
Grande region today was extant as far north as Coprano Bay between 7100 and 6650 B.P. In
contrast, marine stillstands are also identified that are characterized by low Chenopodiaceae
values, high freshwater aquatic pollen levels, and high levels of Quercus pollen; first from 5800
to 5400 B.P., then ca. 3650 B.P., and finally from 3050 B.P. to present (Albert 2006). Table 1
provides summary data for the Swan Lake sea-level and climatic historical phases, as developed
by Albert (2006).

Long-term stillstand conditions were attained after 3050 B.P., which encouraged barrier island
formation, low bay salinities, and the establishment of biotically productive, freshwater estuarine
marshlands. Ricklis (1995) proposes that marine transgressions or rises in sea level, promote an
emergence of low-productivity halophytic biomes, while stillstand conditions lead to an
emergence of high-productivity estuarine marshes. These fluctuations would also result in
fluctuating intensity of occupations as expressed in the archaeological record.

CULTURAL SETTING AT NAVAL AIR STATION KINGSVILLE
Prehistoric Overview
The project area is located in the Coastal Bend Cultural Region (Perttula 2004). The prehistory
of the Coastal Bend region, also called the Coastal Texas region, can be divided into four
periods: Early Archaic, Middle Archaic, Late Archaic, and Late Prehistoric (Figure 5) (Hester
2004). The Paleoindian period, found in the chronologies of other regions in Texas, is not
represented in the current regional chronology because Paleoindian site data are generally absent
(or undocumented) across the region. Although the Paleoindian period is absent in the
chronology of the Coastal Texas region, a general overview of the south Texas Paleoindian
culture period is presented here for reference.

Ricklis (2004) further divides the Coastal Texas region by different cultural traits exhibited into
the Central and Lower Texas Coast subregions. The current project area is located within the
Central Texas Coast subregion.
Paleoindian Period
Initial human occupation of south Texas is thought to have occurred during the Paleoindian
period from approximately 11,200 to 7500 B.P. (Black 1989b; Hester 2004). Evidence of
Paleoindian habitation within the Central Texas Coast region is scant. Ricklis (2004) proposes
that the earliest demonstrable human occupation and exploitation of the central coast shoreline
dates to the Early Archaic period. The lack of Paleoindian sites within the Central Texas Coast
region has likely resulted from sea-level fluctuations during the terminal Pleistocene through
early Holocene. Bousman et al. (2004) note that no true coastal Paleoindian sites have been
identified because the Pleistocene-era coastlines would have been inundated by rising sea levels.
Bousman et al. (2004) also note that the classification of projectile points remains one of the
most important concerns of Paleoindian archaeologists in Texas, and that the entire culturalhistorical framework of Paleoindian archaeology is highly dependent on projectile point
classifications. Fluted lanceolate forms such as Clovis and Folsom point types are the most
distinctive Paleoindian projectile points. In addition, other non-fluted lanceolate forms and some
stemmed points are also known to be associated with Paleoindian deposits. As a result of several
typological problems surrounding the non-fluted lanceolate Paleoindian projectile points, a
comprehensive study was undertaken in 1998 during the Texas Archaeological Research
Laboratory (TARL) Wilson-Leonard Project. This involved a quantitative analysis of projectile
points based on metric attributes. Projectile points analyzed predominantly fell within two broad
morphological categories of 1) non-fluted lanceolate forms and 2) contracting stem and parallel
stem forms. Within the contracting stem forms, three point types were identified: Angostura,
Lubbock, and Thrall. Although two other groups of projectile points were identified within the

contracting stem formsâtypes previously defined as Midland and Milnesâthe forms lacked
adequate evidence to support the assignment of firm type definitions. Parallel stem point forms
were further divided into two general classes, specimens with shallow-to-moderate basal
concavities, and those with deep basal concavities. Projectile point types identified as having
shallow-to-moderate concavities included Plainview, St. Maryâs Hall, and Scottsbluff. Point
types identified as having deep basal concavities included atypical St. Maryâs Hall, Golondrina,
Barber, and Dalton types.
Paleoindian projectile points found within the South Texas Plains, adjacent to the Central Texas
Coast region, include Clovis, Folsom, Plainview, Golondrina, Scottsbluff, and Angostura (Black
1989b; Hester 1980). Projectile point types identified as having shallow-to-moderate concavities
included Plainview, St. Maryâs Hall, and Scottsbluff. Point types identified as having deep basal
concavities included atypical St. Maryâs Hall, Golondrina, Barber, and Dalton types. Stemmed
projectile points found in Paleoindian contexts include Wilson, Berclair, San Patrice, and Big
Sandy point types (Bousman et al. 2004).
It was generally thought that the Paleoindian people were big-game hunters of large herbivores,
with extinct Pleistocene species such as the mammoth (Mammuthus spp.) and bison (Bison
bison), being the preferred prey (Black 1989b). As more data are accumulated, a more
generalized subsistence strategy for Paleoindian populations is being proposed. Subsistence data
from early Paleoindian (terminal Pleistocene) sites in Texas show the exploitation of large game
and extinct megafauna such as mammoth, bison, short-faced bear (Arctodus simus), horse (Equus
ferus caballus), and giant armadillo (Priodontes maximus). Additionally, faunal assemblages
from several archaeological sites, such as Aubrey (41DN479) and Lewisville (41DN72), also
contain a broad range of small taxa. Paleoindian subsistence and settlement patterns suggest a
very low population density in the area, with small highly mobile bands operating in larger
territorial ranges (Black 1989b).
Early Archaic Period
Cultural traits of the Early Archaic period (ca. 7500 B.P. to 4200 B.P.) are similar to the
preceding Paleoindian period. Ricklis (2004) notes that there are two major prehistoric
occupations during the Early Archaic centering ca. 7500 to 6800 B.P. and ca. 5800 to 4200 B.P.
Evidence of the initial shoreline occupation dating from 7500 to 6800 B.P. consists of thick but
dense lenses (or strata) of oyster shells (Crassotrea virginica) that rest at the base of the
Holocene deposits and atop the Pleistocene Beaumont Formation. These early sites contain scant
faunal material and few lithic artifacts (Ricklis 2004).
Evidence for the later Early Archaic period (ca. 5800 to 4200 B.P.) occupation is better
documented, consisting of a thin (5 to 25 cm) stratum of oyster shells near shoreline occupations
or brackish-water clams (Rangia flexuosa) within the riverine areas. Artifacts from excavated
contexts are limited but include chert debitage, utilized chert flakes, chert end scrapers, shell
tools (perforated oyster shell, edge-modified oyster shell), and chert dart points such as Bell,
Early Triangular, Tortugas, and Gower point forms. Subsistence data includes fish otoliths
representing several different species, including black drum (Pogonias cromis), spotted seatrout
(Cynoscion nebulosis), redfish (Sciaenops ocellata), Atlantic croaker (Micropogon undulatus),
and hardhead catfish (Aurius felis). Although the cultural deposits from this period are generally

too old for bone material preservation, the presence of dart points suggests that some hunting
was taking place. At site 41NU267, some faunal bone was preserved including fish, deer
(Odocoileus spp.), and rodents (Ricklis 2004). Early Archaic diagnostic artifacts of the broader
south Texas area include Bell, Andice, Early Triangular, and Early Expanding Stem dart points,
as well as large thin triangular bifaces with concave bases, and Guadalupe and unifacial Clear
Fork distally beveled tools (Black 1989b).
Middle Archaic Period
Middle Archaic period (ca. 4200 B.P. to 3100 B.P.) sites are more common in south Texas than
sites from previous periods, however, radiocarbon data from the Central Texas Coast shows little
occupation of the shoreline (Black 1989b; Ricklis 2004). Given the larger number of Middle
Archaic sites in the greater south Texas area, including evidence from Choke Canyon, Loma
Sandia, and the Coastal Bend area, the Middle Archaic may be generalized as a period of
population growth (Black 1989b). Within the Coastal Bend region, there is a continued
adaptation to the littoral resources, particularly those of the estuary bays. Evidence of increased
plant utilization for subsistence is also seen during the Middle Archaic period, including the
increase in the use of groundstones and roasting/baking hearths. Acorns and mesquite are
suggested as major plant resources utilized during this period. In addition, other resources such
as land snails, freshwater mussels, deer, and other mammals were also exploited during the
Middle Archaic. Artifacts indicative of Middle Archaic sites include the Pedernaes, Langtry,
Kinney, and Bulverde projectile point types, as well as medium- to small-sized distally beveled
tools. Groundstone artifacts such as tubular stone pipes, grinding slabs, and manos also become
common in Middle Archaic contexts (Black 1989b). In the Coastal Bend region, the earliest
Aransas complex materials include Matamoros, Palmillas, Morhiss, and Bulverde points, as well
as incised bone. Conch columela gouges and conch adzes also started to appear in the Middle
Archaic (Black 1989b).
Late Archaic Period
The Late Archaic period (ca. 3100 B.P. to 950 B.P.) saw a continued increase in population from
the Middle Archaic as evident from the increase in Late Archaic period site density. Subsistence
patterns in the Coastal Bend region demonstrate resource exploitation of a wide range of
shellfish, fish, and small mammals with a focus on marine resources, particularly those of
estuary bays. Inland sites show a focus on plant resources but also included the use of a variety
of small mammals such as rodents and rabbits. Late Archaic period artifacts may include small
corner or side-notched dart points such as Ensor, Frio, Marcos, Fairland, and Ellis types. Small
distally beveled tools are also common in south Texas Late Archaic assemblages. In the Coastal
Bend region, later Aransas complex materials are present, including Ensor, Fairland, Darl, CatÃ¡n,
and possibly Matamoros dart points (Black 1989b).
Late Prehistoric Period
The Late Prehistoric period (ca. 950 B.P. to 250 B.P.) saw a change from the small expanding
stem dart points of the Late Archaic period to smaller expanding stem arrow points with the
concurrent adoption of the bow and arrow. This transition was fairly rapid throughout south
Texas. In the Coastal Bend region, the Late Prehistoric period begins later (ca. 750 B.P.) with
the Rockport complex that extends geographically from Matagorda Bay to Baffin Bay, and the
Brownsville complex in the area of the Rio Grande Delta. The high density of Late Prehistoric

period sites suggests that there were fairly high population densities during the Late Prehistoric
period. Inland sites tended to be located near water while sites in upland locations are less
common. Along the Coastal Bend region, Late Prehistoric period sites seem to be concentrated
along the bays, on the barrier islands, and along the brackish water streams and rivers above the
bays. Subsistence data for the Late Prehistoric period has been predominantly gathered from
inland sites due to relatively good preservation. Evidence from the inland sites of south Texas
demonstrates an emphasis on faunal exploitation, with a large and diverse range of species being
utilized. Bison was an important component of Late Prehistoric subsistence, as well as other
artiodactyls such as deer and pronghorn (Artilocapra americana).
In the Coastal Bend region, there is considerable amount of faunal diversity including a variety
of marine and brackish water species. Generally, arrow points and pottery are the diagnostic
artifacts associated with Late Prehistoric sites in south Texas. In the Coastal Bend region, the
Fresno (triangular) and Padre (ovate) projectile points are indicative of the earlier part of the Late
Prehistoric period, while the Perdiz and Bulbar Stemmed projectile points are indicative of the
later part of the Late Prehistoric period. Bone-tempered pottery is common during the Late
Prehistoric period in inland sites, while Rockport pottery is indicative of the Rockport complex
in the Coastal Bend region. Rockport pottery consists of thin, sandy paste wares that often have
asphaltum (decoration and edge mending) and incised decorations. The Brownsville complex is
dominated by a shell-working industry containing various shell tools (scrapers, gouges, projectile
points) along with other ornaments such as beads, pendants, and gorgets. Stemmed arrow points
are virtually absent in the Brownsville complex, while triangular stone arrow points, such as
Matamoros, Fresno, Starr, and Cameron, are more common. Other distinct Late Prehistoric
period artifact types in south Texas include beveled stone knives and small end scrapers, as well
as ceramic figurines and smoking pipes. Marine and mussel shell ornaments and bird bone beads
have been recovered from Late Prehistoric period sites (Black 1989b).
By the early nineteenth century, the local indigenous population was either culturally or
biologically extinct or displaced. As a result, information on Protohistoric/Historic-era Native
American groups is primarily derived from the historic documentation of European explorers and
settlers. The Coastal Bend region was historically inhabited by several different Native
American groups including the Coahuiltecans, Karankawas, Lipan Apaches, and Tonkawas.
These groups were subdivided into numerous smaller bands, such as the Atakapa, Borado,
Cavas, Capoque, Emet, Kohani, Kopani, Malaquite, Payata, and Sana Tamique, among others
(Hester 1989; Newcombe 2002).
Historic Overview
The Historic-era chronology of the Coastal Bend region can be divided into five temporal
periods. These historic periods are defined by distinct artifact assemblages along with historic
archival/documentary evidence.

Spanish Exploration Period
The Spanish Exploration period begins with the presence of European explorers, mostly of
Spanish descent in the Coastal Bend region. The first Europeans thought to enter the area were
Alvar NuÃ±ez, better known as Cabeza de Vaca, along with three companions (SÃ¡nchez 1992).
The Panfilo de NarvÃ¡ez expedition, of which Cabeza de Vaca was a member, was shipwrecked
on the upper Texas coast at a location they described as the Isla del Malhado (SÃ¡nchez 1992;
Hester 1999). The Isla del Malhado was probably Galveston Island or a nearby island, given the
known ethnohistoric and archaeological record (Hester 1999). There is disagreement among
historians, anthropologists, and archaeologists on the route taken by Cabeza de Vacaâs group
across Texas. The Krieger route, which takes Cabeza de Vaca from the upper and central Texas
coast, through southern Texas, into northeastern Mexico, and perhaps back into west Texas, is
the most probable of all the routes proposed, given the archaeological and ethnohistoric record
(Hester 1999). By 1535, Cabeza de Vaca and his three companions crossed southern Texas,
reaching different points along the Rio Grande (SÃ¡nchez 1992).
Spanish Colonial Period
No real attempts to settle the area were made until the late seventeenth century and as a response
to a French settlement established by RenÃ© Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle on the Texas Coast
in 1568. After an unsuccessful attempt at establishing missions in east Texas during the latter
part of the seventeenth century, the Spanish decided that a three-pronged approach that included
mission, presidio, and civilian settlement would be the best strategy to establish a Spanish
presence in the area. The Corpus Christi Bay remained unexplored until 1747, when JoaquÃ­n
Prudencio de Orobio y Basterra led an expedition down the Nueces River to its mouth. After
several failed attempts, the first settlement in the area was founded by Blas MarÃ­a de la Garza
FalcÃ²n in 1766. He established a ranch called Santa Petronila on Petronila Creek. Despite many
ranchers from the Rio Grande Valley applying for and receiving land grants in the lower Nueces
Valley during the end of the eighteenth century, the area was slow to develop. By 1794, a large
ranch belonging to Juan Barrera, known as Rancho de Santa Gertrudis, was established on the
north side of Corpus Christi Bay. An Indian uprising in 1812 forced many of the colonists to
seek refuge in the Rio Grande Valley. Hostilities with the Comanches and Lipans in the area
continued until the end of Spanish control of the region (Long 2010; Fox 1989).
Mexican Colonial Period
With Mexican independence in 1821, the region became part of Tamaulipas. Remaining land in
the area was deeded to individuals by the Tamaulipan government. After several unsuccessful
attempts to settle the area, Fort LipantitlÃ¡n was established in 1831 where the road from
Matamoros to Goliad crossed the Nueces River. Irish and German settlers also moved into the
area during the 1820s and 1830s (Long 2010; Fox 1989).
Texas Republic and Nineteenth Century American Period
The Texas Republic period began in 1836 after the Texas Revolution. During that time, the
region became a no manâs land, with both Mexican and Texan merchants engaging in illegal
trading in the Nueces Valley. Henry Lawerence Kinney established a trading post and fort on
Corpus Christi Bay in 1839. By 1842, a post office had opened, and in 1845 the settlement
experienced a brief boom, although population declined after the Mexican War. During this

period, large-scale ranching rapidly became one of the major bases of the economy (Long 2010;
Fox 1989).
In 1852, Richard King purchased several tracts of land fronting Santa Gertrudis Creek. The first
grant obtained was the Ricon de Santa Gertrudis comprising roughly 15,500 ac of land at the
junction of the Santa Gertrudis and San Fernando creeks near their confluence with Laguna
Madre. The grant included the area that is now Kingsville. King also purchased Santa Gertrudis
de la Garza, which included approximately 54,000 ac of land. It was on this land that King
would begin his cattle operation. In 1860, King founded R. King and Company, along with
partners James Walworth and Mifflin Kenedy, which joined all the land titles of James
Walworth, King and his wife Henrietta, and Mifflin Kenedy (Coalson 2010; Chessman 2010;
THC 1966).
During the Civil War, King and his partners entered into several contracts with the Confederate
government to supply European buyers with cotton while they, in return, supplied Confederate
forces with beef, horses, imported munitions, medical supplies, clothing, and shoes. King, who
also owned a steamship company, moved operations of the steamship to Matamoros under
Mexican registry, which successfully avoided Union blockades for the most part. At the end of
the war, King fled to Mexico, returning only after securing his pardon from President Andrew
Johnson in 1865 (Coalson 2010; Chessman 2010; THC 1966). Following the war, raids from
Mexican bandits started to rise and, until 1875, continued persistently and unchecked. By the
end of these raids, King had suffered losses totaling one million dollars. Despite the losses, King
continued to buy land and acquired a large section of the San Carricitos grant in south Texas
(THC 1966).
Richard King passed away on April 14, 1884, leaving his heirs land valued at $564,784 and
livestock worth $496,700. After his death, his son-in-law continued land acquisition, as well as
methodical breeding of cattle. Even though difficult financial times during the 1880s
necessitated the selling of approximately 10,995 ac of land, efforts continued to consolidate and
obtain land grants for the ranch. In 1901, they bought 60,000 ac in the grants Las Comitos, El
Infernillo, and most of El Chiltipin. In 1906, Ricon de los Laureles was purchased from the
Texas Land and Cattle Company totaling 110,000 ac (THC 1966).
The King Ranch ranks as one of the most outstanding and best known of all cattle enterprises in
the history of the southwestern cattle frontier. The only new breed of cattle to be developed in
the U.S., the Santa Gertrudis breed, was produced on King Ranch. In addition, studies of
grassland and animal diseases conducted at King Ranch contributed greatly to the cattle industry
(THC 1966). As such, the King Ranch Headquarters, located approximately 5 mi west of NAS
Kingsville, was designated as a National Historic Landmark (NHL) in 1961 for the ranchâs
historic-era significance in the development of western ranching and agriculture (Williams et al.
1995).
Twentieth Century American Period
By 1903, the St. Louis, Brownsville, and Mexico Railway was being built through south Texas;
Henrietta King opened several tracts of her land for sale. The town of Kingsville was laid out in
a pasture 3 mi east of the Ranch Headquarters. By 1912, the population of the town was

approximately 4,000 people. With the introduction of the railroad and the establishment of
Ricardo, a trading center for farmers located on the railroad 6 mi south of Kingsville, the local
economy began to shift from ranching to farming and dairying. The population continued to
rapidly grow in the region during the early part of the twentieth century, and by 1913, the Texas
Legislature, prompted by pressure from the regional population of the area, organized Kleberg
County. Kingsville was subsequently designated as the county seat (Coalson 2010).
Several industries in the early-to-middle twentieth century prompted rapid population growth in
the county. Oil exploration began early in the region, with the first producing well being
discovered in 1919. The first industry in the county was a cotton mill, established in Kingsville
in 1921. Additional growth came from the establishment of the South Texas Teachers College
(now Texas A&M University at Kingsville) in 1925 (Stokes et al. 2009).
Another population boom occurred in early 1942 as a result of the development of the Naval
Auxiliary Air Station (NAAS) 3 mi southeast of Kingsville. NAAS Kingsville was one of
several U.S. Naval aviation facilities built during World War II to support flight training in south
Texas. Two runways for âP-4â aircraft called the North and South Fields were initially designed
and separated by nearly 5,000 ft. The majority of the buildings were placed between the two
fields. The buildings were temporary and semi-permanent facilities and based on standardized
plans used at military installations throughout the nation. The administrative offices (Building
700), the gatehouse (Building 775), runways at North Field and South Field, and hangars and
aircraft maintenance facilities (Buildings 760 and 771) were constructed first. Support facilities
including the fire station and warehouse facilities (Buildings 776 and 701, respectively) were
built soon after. The main activity at the station focused on the runways and pilot training
(Stokes et al. 2009).
After World War II ended, the Navy could not maintain an expensive, full wartime complement
of Navy bases throughout south Texas. As a result, the Navy decommissioned the Kingsville
base on August 1, 1946, and Navy personnel vacated the station by mid-September (Stokes et al.
2009). A local governmental board accepted stewardship of the base, leasing the facility from
the U.S. Government for a nominal $1-per-year fee. Local businesses, community groups, and
Texas A&M College expressed interest in the facilities and the college was granted a lease. The
station facilities served an important satellite function for the growing college for nearly 4 years.
By late 1950, and in response to the potential conflict with Korea, Navy officials recommissioned NAAS Kingsville on April 1, 1951. Texas A&M College received word of their
lease change in December 1950 and completely vacated the site by the following summer
(Stokes et al. 2009).
The re-commissioned NAAS Kingsville would serve as a jet transitional training facility.
Rehabilitation construction work began in March 1951, and by late June the field was fully
operational. The Korean Conflict ended with a cease-fire agreement in 1953, but much of the
building program associated with the reactivation of NAAS Kingsville during the Korean
Conflict continued. Between the end of the Korean Conflict and beginning of the Vietnam
Conflict, the number of personnel at NAAS Kingsville fluctuated in response to Naval funding
allocations. Similarly, building renovation and replacement at the NAAS also fluctuated with
funding.

On October 31, 1956, NALF Orange Grove, located 20.0 mi away from NAAS Kingsville, was
commissioned, though it had been used in an unofficial capacity by cadets for some time. As the
American military became increasingly reliant on jet aircraft during the 1950s, education for the
Navyâs pilots at NAAS Kingsville kept pace with the technological changes. In 1960, NAAS
Kingsville became an all-jet training base. The land that would become the McMullen Range
Complex was purchased by the U.S. Government ca. 1965 and was established to take the place
of bombing ranges on Padre Island as they were decommissioned. In 1968, the Navy upgraded
NAAS Kingsville to an autonomous NAS. During the late 1960s, the NAS Kingsville Civil
Disturbance Rifle Detachment drilled regularly at the Station in response to official fears about
popular uprisings from both civil rights proponents and students protesting American
involvement in Southeast Asia. In 1990, the Navy acquired the Escondido Ranch, a hunting
ranch located 90 mi northwest of Kingsville. The ranch is managed by the Morale, Welfare, and
Recreation Department of NAS Kingsville and is used by Navy personnel and their families.
Administration of the McMullen Range Complex, formerly part of NAS Chase Field, came
under NAS Kingsville in 1993 (Stokes et al. 2009).
Archival Research and Records Search
Prior to the initiation of the pedestrian field surveys, a records search was performed by GSRC
personnel on the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas website on October 8, 2014. The records
search sought to identify any previous cultural resources surveys, cemeteries, landmarks, and
historic structures, buildings, sites, districts or objects, as well as any previously recorded
archaeological sites within 1.0 mi of the project area. In addition, GSRC personnel reviewed the
government-furnished materials provided by NAVFAC SE.
Previously Conducted Archaeological Investigations
A total of eight previously conducted archaeological investigations were on file as having been
conducted within 1.0 mi of the survey area, which includes the Naval Air Station Kingsville
Integrated Cultural Resources Management Plan FY 2009-2014 (Table 2). The sponsoring
agencies for the surveys included the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), NAVFAC SE,
and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Vicksburg and Mobile Districts. Projects with
corresponding polygons are plotted on Figure 6.

Naval Air Station Kingsville Integrated Cultural Resources Management Plan
An ICRMP was developed in May 2009 for NAS Kingsville and its outlying properties, which
include four additional properties managed under NAS Kingsville: NALF Orange Grove, the
King Ranch ROTHR Site, McMullen Range Complex (Yankee and Dixie Target Ranges), and
Esondido Ranch. At the time of the publication of the ICRMP, a total of 117 ac had undergone
archaeological site identification on the NAS Kingsville main base, which includes the survey of
10 ac performed for USACE, Mobile District identified in Table 2 above (Stokes et al. 2009).
An additional 23.5 acres at the NAS Kingsville main base were surveyed in April 2013 in
support of a Small Arms Range (Werner 2013). A reconnaissance-level survey was conducted in
1995, which resulted in the identification of four archaeological sites on the NAS Kingsville
main base. While an abstract for this investigation and site forms for the four sites recorded are
available from the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas, no archaeological investigation boundary is
mapped in the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas.
Archaeological Survey of 1,000 Acres at Naval Air Station Kingsville, Kleberg County, Texas
A recent investigation by GSRC involved survey and shovel testing of 1,000 acres at NAS
Kingsville (Huffer and Ryan 2014). As a result of fieldwork, GSRC documented one previously
known and six newly identified archaeological sites within the inventoried areas. Only one of
the newly identified sites, 41KL105, is located within the 1-mile radius of the current
investigation
The archaeological work conducted at NAS Kingsville, as well as in other locations in Kleberg
County, suggests that archaeological sites are predominantly located near water sources and
consist of relatively few artifacts that are often on or just below the surface (Stokes et al. 2009).
Previously Recorded Archaeological and Historic Resources
Eight previously recorded archaeological sites were recorded within 1.0 mi of the survey as
indicated within THCâs Texas Archeological Site Atlas and GSRCâs archival research (Table 3).

SURVEY METHODS
Fieldwork
During the initiation of fieldwork, known populations of south Texas ambrosia within the survey
areas were flagged for avoidance. The field crew members underwent an orientation, including
an onsite visitation of a known population of south Texas ambrosia, and included information
regarding the protective status of the plant, the identifying characteristics of the plant, and
measures to ensure avoidance or minimization of impacts on the species during the surveys. In
addition, handouts were provided to each field crew member with information regarding the
south Texas ambrosia including its habitat, photographs of identifying characteristics of the
plant, and information on its protected status. These handouts aided in the identification of south
Texas ambrosia populations during field operations. Field crew members avoided any identified
populations of south Texas Ambrosia and did not excavate any shovel test pits within 20 m of
any known or identified populations.
The survey was scheduled for the winter months when vegetation and ground cover was minimal
and ground surface visibility was optimal. Prior to fieldwork each day, a safety meeting was led
by the project director to discuss potential hazards, and measures of avoidance. GSRC field
personnel conducted the intensive archaeological pedestrian survey supplemented with limited
systematic shovel testing on 700 ac of NAS Kingsville in accordance with the Archaeological
Survey Standards for Texas recommended by THC. The pedestrian survey employed parallel
transects spaced no greater than 30 m (100 ft) apart, during which the ground surface was
inspected for any artifacts, features, or other cultural material. Transects were aligned in a
cardinal direction across the survey area depending on the terrain and access. The pedestrian
survey was supplemented with the excavation of STPs (n=234) at a ratio of one STP per 3 ac.
Additional STPs (n=17) were excavated at a minimum ratio of six STPs per archaeological site
in order to define the horizontal and vertical extent of cultural deposits and features. Along
transects, each STP was numbered consecutively from transect origin to its terminus. Unique
numerical identification labels were assigned to each STP and contain two components. The
first component is an abbreviation of the transect number, such as T1 for Transect 1. The second
component is the STP number assigned consecutively along the transect from the transect origin
such as STP3 for Shovel Test 3. These components are then combined. Using the above
examples, T1-STP3 represents the third shovel test from the origin of Transect 1. The number of
STPs in each transect varied depending on impenetrable obstacles, water, steep slopes, and the
irregular shape of the survey area.
All STPs excavated were square, measuring 30 cm in length on each side to their terminal
depths. All STPs were excavated using flat blade shovels and to the base of Holocene deposits,
if practical. All STPs were excavated in arbitrary 10-cm levels. All excavated soils were
screened utilizing hand box screens with 0.25 in mesh. Any artifacts recovered from the
excavated STPs were recorded, bagged, and reported by provenience. The size, depth, and
contents of all STPs excavated were recorded. Profiles of all STPs excavated were recorded
utilizing the Munsell Soil Color Chart to describe the strata and soil colors. Soil horizons and
strata were described using standard scientific terms. All cultural features found in excavated
shovel test pits were recorded in plan and profile, as appropriate, along with other pertinent
information regarding the feature, including dimensions, depth, orientations, and possible

associations. All information recorded during the excavation of STPs was documented on
standardized STP forms prepared for the project. The information from the STP forms prepared
in the field was used to develop STP logs that were maintained for the duration of the project.
The STP logs included information on the depth of each STP excavated, the number of artifacts,
if any, recovered from each STP, the location of the STP (expressed in transect and shovel test
number), and soil conditions. The STP logs along with the STP forms prepared in the field will
be submitted to NAS Kingsville for curation as part of the permanent project records. All
excavated STPs were backfilled upon their completion.
No transect STPs were positive for cultural materials, although surface scatters of artifacts were
discovered through pedestrian survey. Additional shovel tests were excavated at the locations of
surface scatters to determine if a subsurface component was present. STPs excavated to explore
whether subsurface deposits were associated with surface artifact scatters were assigned unique
identification labels. Within each surface scatter an initial shovel test designated as the
temporary arbitrary datum with the coordinate north (N) 1000 m east (E) 1000 m was
excavated. From the datum STP further delineation STPs were excavated in a cruciform pattern
toward the cardinal directions at 10-m intervals. These delineation STPs were assigned a
coordinate based labels depending on their position in cardinal directions from the originating
STP. Coordinate values increase with distance toward the north and east and decrease in value
to the south and west. An STP with the label abbreviated as N990-E1010 would be so named for
its location 10 m south and 10 m east of N1000-E1000 whereas an STP label N1010-E990
would be 10 m north and 10 m west of N1000-E1000.
A site plan map was prepared during the delineation of archaeological sites and isolated finds.
The site plan map minimally shows the site boundaries, locations of all positive and negative
delineation and transect STPs, any STPs not excavated during the delineation of the find, the
extent of any surface artifacts observed, all cultural features within the site boundary, estimated
contours derived from topographic maps of the area along with observations made in the field,
topographic features such as streams and drainages, man-made features such as roads or trails,
any vegetation indicative of historic occupation, the location of the site marker established at the
site, and any areas of observable disturbance. Site boundaries were set halfway between the last
positive and the first of the two consecutive negative STPs or according to terrain feature and
surface manifestations of the site as described above in the site boundary delineation methods.
Site plan maps are included in the draft and final technical reports and with the state site record
forms that will be submitted to TARL. In addition, archaeological site forms or site update
forms, as appropriate, will be prepared utilizing TexSite, for their submission to TARL and the
assignment of official state trinomial site numbers.
A sub-meter-accurate TrimbleÂ® Global Positioning System (GPS) unit was used to record
relevant features of all archaeological sites and isolated finds identified during this study. GPS
points were taken of the center of the archaeological site or isolated finds. Universal Trans
Mercator (UTM) coordinates of all the center points for all archaeological sites and isolated finds
will be provided to NAS Kingsville. In addition, points were taken for observable cultural
features, locations where relevant images or photographs were taken, diagnostic surface artifacts,
and the archaeological site or isolated find boundaries. These data will be converted into
Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) shapefiles and will be made available to the
NAS Kingsville Archaeology Survey

coordinates were determined through observations in the field and the use of USGS topographic
quadrangles. Metadata associated with Geographic Information System (GIS) files will be
maintained and submitted to the NAVFAC SE technical representative and NAS Kingsville staff
as a deliverable with the GIS data, in accordance with the United States Navy 3.01 Data Model
provided by NAVFAC SE.
Photographic data was collected at each site location during the delineation of the site
boundaries. Photographs were taken with a digital camera with a minimum of 8 megapixels of
resolution. Images will be submitted in JPEG or TIFF format at 300 Dots Per Inch (DPI) or
greater resolution. Sufficient photographs were taken at each archaeological site to record the
significant information describing the site. Minimal photographic documentation at all
archaeological sites recorded included any vegetation that may be emblematic of historic sites,
features encountered on the surface or in excavated shovel test pits, highly disturbed areas within
the delineated site boundaries, and a minimum of two overview photographs. All photographs
taken in the field included an appropriate scale, a compass direction indicator, and either a real or
digital menu board or chalkboard that indicates the subject of the photograph. These elements
are located clearly within the photograph and placed to not detract from a clear rendering of the
subject. A second image or photograph was taken without the information board and direction
indicator for images or photographs that are anticipated to be used as illustrations in the technical
report. Directional and subject information were recorded in the photograph log maintained
during the study and in the figure captions used in the draft and final technical reports.
A survey photograph log was maintained for the duration of the study. The survey photograph
log was sequentially numbered and includes the field site number, cardinal directions of the
image, the subject, and the date the image was taken. This log and at least one image of all the
significant data will be submitted to NAS Kingsville for curation as part of the permanent project
records. Lost, damaged, or absent required images will be explained for each site in the survey
photograph log, as well as in the draft and final technical reports.
Diagnostic artifacts recovered from the surface and any artifacts recovered from shovel tests
were collected and placed in new 4 mil polyethylene resealable zipper storage bags marked with
provenience information in indelible ink on the exterior and cataloged in a field specimen
inventory. All bags are labeled with the project name, site name and number (if applicable),
provenience information, artifact type and count, date, excavatorâs name (or initials), and a field
specimen (FS) number.
Laboratory Analysis and Curation
Laboratory analysis was initiated in the field by a detailed recording of provenience information
and assigning FS identification numbers to artifacts. Post-field processing in the laboratory
began with cross-checking field specimens with the inventory lists from the field. All artifacts
and other cultural materials recovered were washed (if appropriate), stabilized, and cataloged.
These materials were analyzed and processed using categories and techniques in accordance with
the Stipulations and Procedures for the Preparation of Archeological Material Collections to be

Curated at TARL and Separation of Collections for Housing at TARL and Stipulations and
Procedures for the Preparation of Archeological Records and Photographs, Curation Supplies
and Sources provided by TARL. Prehistoric ceramics were classified into recognized
typological categories. Counts and weights, as well as position on the vessel (e.g., rim, base,
body), were determined for all sherds. Lithic materials were separated into waste flakes
(debitage), tools, and manufacturing failures/production rejects. Stone tools were categorized
into standard typologies. The analysis of the waste flakes followed standard protocols and
categories dependent on the quantity of material recovered. Faunal remains were identified to
the lowest possible taxonomic category. Historic artifacts were identified and cataloged into
standard typological or functional categories. Metal or other oxidizing materials were evaluated
for their research or data recovery potential and, if warranted, stabilized appropriately.
All recovered material, field notes, forms, and other project records were prepared for curation
following both Federal standards (Curation of Federally-Owned and Administered
Archaeological Collections; Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] Title 36, Part 79). Artifacts
were placed in new 4 mil polyethylene resealable zipper storage bags with acid-free labels that
include full provenience and catalog information. Artifacts were packaged in acid-free storage
boxes clearly labeled with project, dates, and provenience. All field logs and field notes,
analysis sheets, photographic record forms, and other documents produced during execution of
this project were printed on acid-free paper and will be included in the curation delivery. Each
box will include an inventory of contents on acid-free paper and an electronic inventory. All
materials will be returned to NAS Kingsville for curation in the repository at the Center for
Archaeological Research (CAR), University of Texas San Antonio (UTSA).

SURVEY RESULTS
The cultural resources survey resulted in the documentation of two newly identified
archaeological sites and three isolated occurrences of cultural material (Figure 7).
Field Site 1
Field Site 1 is a late-nineteenth to middle-twentieth century historic artifact scatter located in a
plowed agricultural field approximately 350 ft outside of the perimeter fence, south of the
airfield (Figure 8, Photograph 1). The scatter consists of approximately 100 to 150 items of
household refuse (glass and ceramic). The entire area is heavily disturbed with a plow zone to a
depth of 30 cm below ground surface.

Photograph 1. Field Site 1 overview, facing north.
The site area is situated 1.3 mi west of San Fernando Creek and 1.2 mi north of San Gertrudis
Creek. The site measures approximately 300 ft (91 m) east to west and 150 ft (45.7 m) north to
south. The southern portion of the site is located outside of the current survey area. Visual
examination of the portion of the site outside of survey area is similar to the portion that was
delineated. The boundary of Field Site 1 was defined by the extent of the observed surface
artifacts; eight shovel test pits were excavated to ascertain the potential depth of cultural
deposits. Artifacts were encountered to depths ranging from 0 to 30 centimeters below ground
surface, but the subsurface deposition of artifacts is due to plowing and bioturbation and is not
representative of a subsurface horizon.

The site is a discrete scatter of household refuse. A total of 44 artifacts were collected from
Field Site 1, with 37 artifacts collected from the modern ground surface and seven artifacts
collected from five STPs (Table 4). Artifacts recorded at Field Site 1 consist predominantly of
glass and ceramic artifacts with one brick fragment recorded. The glass artifacts are shards of
various colors including amber (n=2), amber/black (n=1), aquamarine (n=2), clear (n=6), cobalt
blue (n=2), milk glass (n=7), and solarized manganese (n=2). Ceramic artifacts included sherds
of ironstone (n=1), porcelain (n=4), semi-porcelaineous earthenware (n=5), stoneware (n=6), and
whiteware (n=5).

The artifact assemblage and lack of architectural (e.g., stone, brick, or mortar) debris from Field
Site 1 suggests that the site represents a late-nineteenth to middle-twentieth century trash deposit.
Historic homestead sites in the surrounding area, located during GSRCâs previous survey,
displayed a high concentration of brick and stone foundation scatters that are absent from this
site, suggesting that Field Site 1 is a single-episode trash dump. There is little or no potential for
intact subsurface deposits given the prolonged agricultural use of the site, and all subsurface
artifacts were confined to the plowzone. It is likely that further archaeological investigation of
the site would yield no new or significant information on the local or regional history of the area,
and additional research or documentation would yield no significant information important to
understanding historic associations of the site. Given the lack of integrity, Field Site 1 is
considered to have low research potential and is not recommended eligible for listing in the
NRHP. No further archaeological work is recommended.
Field Site 2
Field Site 2 is the original Naval Auxiliary Air Station propeller aircraft airstrip and its
associated utilities and debris (Photographs 2 through 6). The airstrip was demolished after its

operation was discontinued due to the introduction of jet airplanes and the requirement for a
newer and larger airstrip. The site is situated 1.8 mi west of San Fernando Creek and 1.2 mi
north of San Gertrudis Creek. The full dimensions of the site could not be measured due to the
eastern half of the airfield being outside of the current survey boundaries (Figure 9). However,
based on historical maps and aerial photography, the estimated dimensions are 5,000 ft (1,524 m)
north to south by 6,500 ft (1,981 m) east to west. The entire southern and eastern portions of the
site, up to Transect 14, have piles of debris scattered throughout the area that is associated with
the demolition of the airstrip. The majority of debris, consisting of piles of asphalt and concrete,
are the result of the demolition of the airstrip and represent secondary deposition along with
construction material to a lesser degree. Many of these piles of debris include modern items
mixed in with older debris, indicating prolonged use of the area as a refuse dump over several
decades.

No STPs in this section of the survey area were positive for subsurface cultural materials, nor did
any STPs display any natural stratigraphy. The site boundaries have been reduced to include just
the original airstrips and not the surrounding areas of secondary deposition. It is likely that
further archaeological investigation of the site would yield no new or significant information on
the local or regional history of the area. Given the lack of integrity, Field Site 2 is considered to
have low research potential and is not recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP. No further
archaeological work is recommended.
Isolated Occurrences
IO 1 is a concrete watering trough that measures 8 ft north to south, 2 ft 8 in east to west, 2 ft tall,
and 4 in thick (Photograph 7). The watering trough has two wooden poles just north of the
trough and rusted piping. Engraved into the south end of the trough is âSEABEES, 24/5/71,
Timmy SMYERâ (Photograph 8). Surface visibility in the area of IO 1 is greater than 85 percent
and no cultural resources were found during the pedestrian survey. No additional shovel tests
were placed around IO 1 due to the lack of surface artifacts and the known age of construction
for the watering trough being less than 50 years old.

IO 2 is a porcelain âKNOX KNOBâ electrical wire insulator located within a loose scatter of
rocks likely associated with the excavation of a utility pole for an active electrical power line
right of way (Photographs 9 through 11). No STPs were placed in the area due to this area
containing a known population of an endangered species (south Texas Ambrosia). The surface
visibility was greater than 85 percent and the area was heavily disturbed due to tilling and cutting
under the power lines. Due to lack of cultural resources and the presence of the protected south
Texas Ambrosia, no more testing will be required for this area.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
GSRC personnel conducted an intensive pedestrian archaeological survey supplemented with
shovel testing of approximately 700 ac at NAS Kingsville, which is located southeast of
Kingsville in Kleberg County, Texas. GSRC conducted the survey for NAVFAC SE according
to the work plan prepared under Contract No. N69450-12-D-0073, Delivery Order 48.
GSRC field personnel recorded two new historic archaeological sites (Field Sites 1 and 2). All
of the archaeological sites and IOs identified by this study represent late Historic-era occupation
of the Kingsville area. Field Site 1 is a late-nineteenth to middle-twentieth century historic
artifact scatter and Field Site 2 is the middle-twentieth century Kingsville NAS airstrip built for
propeller planes.
There is little or no potential for intact subsurface deposits at any of the sites given the extensive
amount of earth-moving activities recorded across the survey area. It is unlikely that additional
archaeological investigation at the sites would yield any new or significant information on the
local or regional history of the area, and additional research or documentation would yield no
significant information important to understanding historic associations of the sites. GSRC
recommends that none of the sites be recommended as eligible for listing in the NRHP and no
further archaeological work is recommended.
