Abstract
On November 23-24 and December 2-3, 2009, the Center for Archaeological Studies (CAS) at
Texas State University-San Marcos conducted an intensive pedestrian survey and shovel testing of the
ca. 170 acre area of potential effect (APE) of the proposed Plum Creek Preserve and Nature Trail for the
City of Kyle Parks Recreation, Facilities, and Maintenance Department. The APE is located in the City
of Kyle, Hays County, Texas. In addition to 100% pedestrian coverage of the portion of the APE that
was not covered by seasonal reservoirs, a total of 52 shovel tests were excavated. This archaeological
investigation satisfies the requirement of a grant to the City of Kyle from the Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department to fund a portion of the Plum Creek Preserve and Nature Trail project. Work was carried
out by Jennifer Hatchett Kimbell, Julian A. Sitters, and Sarah Scogin, under Texas Antiquities Permit
Number 5457 with Jon C. Lohse as Principal Investigator. No archaeological remains were found,
either on the surface or below the surface, during the course of the survey; therefore CAS recommends
clearance be granted to proceed with the proposed project.

Introduction

State University-San Marcos conducted an
archaeological survey of a 170 acre tract of land
that will be developed by the City of Kyle into
a system of parks, trails, and green space. The
project area is located along Plum Creek, in Hays
County, and is partially funded by a grant to

Regulatory Overview

the City Texas Parks and Wildlife Department
(TPWD). The project area is comprised of three
separate but adjoining parcels of land totaling
nearly 170 acres. These parcels include the
Nash Tract (118+ acres), the Linebarger Tract
(50+ acres), and a one-acre parcel from the
Brookside Estates Subdivision. The Plum Creek
Conservation District’s Dam Site #2 is located
within the Nash Tract and Dam Site #3 is located
within the Linebarger Tract. The Plum Creek
Preserve and Nature Trail is bounded by Lehman
Road on the west, FM-150 on the south, and Plum
Creek Watershed on the north (Figure 1).

The City of Kyle is a political subdivision of
the State of Texas, and therefore is required to
comply with the Texas Antiquities Code (TAC).
The TAC requires that such projects consider
the potential impact on any cultural resources
that might be present and that might contribute
information that is meaningful or significant to
understanding the history and prehistory of the
State of Texas. Cultural resources located on land
owned or controlled by the State of Texas or its
political subdivisions are protected by the TAC
(Texas Natural Resources Code, Title 9, Chapter
191), which identifies significant sites as State
Archaeological Landmarks (SALs). Should any
historic or prehistoric sites located on land that
is designated for impact during development be
determined eligible for formal designation of
landmark status under the TAC, some measure
of protection or mitigation of impact may be
necessary. The formal designation of SALs, as
well as their administration, is the responsibility
of the Texas Historical Commission (THC).

As the City of Kyle is a political subdivision
of the State of Texas, and through its use of
funds from TPWD, the City was required under
the Texas Antiquities Code to conduct a survey
to locate and identify any potential historic or
prehistoric cultural resources that might be
present and that might be detrimentally impacted
by the proposed developed.
This report presents the methodology and
results of that survey, which was conducted by
CAS under Texas Antiquities Permit number
5457, issued to Dr. Jon C. Lohse and carried
out in accordance with the guidelines for
archaeological survey set forth by Council of
Texas Archeologists (CTA) and adopted by the
Texas Historical Commission (THC). Sections of
the report present an overview of the regulatory
requirements for the project, describe the
environmental and cultural setting of the project
area, detail the methods that were employed, and
the results of the work that was conducted. Finally,
based on the survey findings, conclusions and
recommendations are presented concerning the
City’s authorization to proceed with the proposed
development.

The TAC generally requires that a
complete archaeological survey be performed
in conjunction with projects that fall under its
purview, particularly in previously unsurveyed
areas and in regions where cultural resources
are expected. Any resources determined to be
significant must then be avoided, protected, or
their destruction mitigated by approved data
recovery programs.
Worthiness for designation as a SAL is
defined in the TAC:
Archaeological sites may be considered
significant and be recognized or designated as
State Archaeological Landmarks, provided that
2

at least one of the following conditions is met
(Rules and Practice, Chapter 41:10):

(c) the site has the potential to contribute to
cumulative cultural history by the addition of
new information; and/or

The archaeological site is situated on land
owned or controlled by the State of Texas or one
of its political subdivisions; [and then]

(d) the site offers evidence of unique or rare
attributes; and/or

(a) preservation of materials must be sufficient
to allow application of standard archaeological
techniques to advantage; and/or

(e) the site offers a unique or rare opportunity
to test techniques, theory, or method of
preservation, thereby contributing to scientific
knowledge.

(b) the majority of artifacts are in place
so that a significant portion of the site’s
original characteristics can be defined through
investigation; and/or

Environmental Setting

Topography of area is gently undulating
punctuated with low hills and prominent alluvial
ridgelines (Batte 1984). Soils within the area
are from the Austin-Castephen-Houston Black
formation and consist of shallow to deep, gently
sloping to sloping soils over chalk or marly clay
(Batte 1984). Soils present within the survey
area are Tinn (Tn), Lewisville (LeB), and Heiden
Series (HeB, HeC3, and HeD3) (Figure 3).

The proposed Park is located in Hays
County, in central Texas (see Figure 1), within the
Blackland Prairie physiographic province (Gould
1975) (Figure 2). The Texas Blackland Prairie
represents the southernmost extension of the
North American tallgrass prairie and dominant
vegetation in this region includes big bluestem,
little bluestem, Indiangrass, switchgrass,
brownseed paspalum, and gramagrass.

The Tinn Series consists of very deep,
moderately well drained, very slowly permeable
soils that formed from weakly consolidated
calcareous clays and marls of Cretaceous Age.

Figure 3. Soils found across the survey area. Soils present within the survey areas are Tinn (Tn), Lewisville
(LeB), and Heiden Series (HeB, HeC3, and HeD3).

The soil texture is clay or silty clay with some
siliceous and pebbles present in the upper 30 cm
(Batte 1984). Tinn clay has a high shrink-swell
potential and is characterized by deep vertical
cracks. The Lewisville Series consists of very
deep, well-drained, moderately permeable soils
that formed in ancient loamy and limy alluvium
assumed to have originated in areas underlain
by limestone. Texture consists of clay loam,
silty clay loam or silty clay (Batte 1984). The
Heiden Series are well-drained and very slowly
permeable soils of deep to weathered shale
on nearly level to moderately steep erosional
uplands. These soils are moderately alkaline and
calcareous throughout with high shrink-swell
properties (Batte 1984).

stage follows, extending from ca. 8,000 BP to
1,200 BP, and is generally seen as a time during
which humans made successful adaptations
to changing environmental conditions. The
Late Prehistoric stage begins ca. 1,200 BP and
is characterized by a resurgence of grassland
habitats and the development of bow and arrow
and ceramic technologies.

Paleoindian
Collins (1995:381–385, 2004) dates the
Paleoindian period to 11,500–8800 BP in
Central Texas, though he excludes the final
Late Paleoindian interval known as Angostura.
Diagnostic artifacts observed from this stage are
associated with the Clovis, Folsom and a variety
of later Paleoindian cultures (Bousman et al.
2004). The Early Paleoindian stage, consisting of
Clovis and Folsom, is generally characterized by
nomadic cultures that relied heavily on hunting
large game animals (Black 1989). Recent research
has shown that Paleoindian peoples also utilized
a wide variety of plants and small game animals
(Black 1989; Bousman et al. 2004; Collins and
Brown 2000; Hester 1983).

Cultural Chronology

The cultural chronologies for Central and
South Texas are not completely understood or
agreed upon. However, archaeological deposits
indicate rich cultural development. Black (1995),
Hester (1995, 2004), and Collins (1995, 2004)
present the most recent syntheses of the available
chronological evidence of archaeological culture
history in the region. The following cultural
chronology is based on Black (1995), Hester
(1995, 2004), and Collins (1995, 2004).

The Late Paleoindian substage occurs from
ca.10,000–8000 BP. Reliable evidence for these
dates was recovered from the Wilson-Leonard
site, north of Austin (Bousman et al. 2004;
Collins 1998). At Wilson-Leonard, archaeologists
excavated an occupation known as Wilson, named
after the unique stemmed projectile point. The
dense occupation also included a human burial
(Bousman et al. 2004; Collins 1998).

Prehistoric
The Prehistoric period is divided into
three major styles, the Paleoindian, Archaic
and Late Prehistoric. The Paleoindian stage is
characterized by the earliest human occupation
of North America prior to 8,000 BP. The Archaic

Archaic
Collins (1995, 2004) contends that the Archaic
stage in Central Texas lasted approximately 7500
5

Middle Archaic

years, from 8800–1200/1300 BP, and, following
Weir (1976), divides the stage into Early, Middle,
and Late Archaic. The Archaic stage marks several
important transitions: a shift from large game
hunting to hunting smaller animals; the increased
use of plant food resources and use of ground
stones in food processing; the implementation
of stone cooking technology; increased use of
organic materials for tool manufacturing and
an increase in the number and variety of lithic
tools for wood working; the predominance of
corner- and side-notch projectile points; greater
population stability and less residential mobility;
and systematic burial of the dead. This stage is
also distinguished by environmental and climatic
changes.

Collins (1995, 2004) divides the Middle
Archaic, 4000–6000 BP, into three projectile
point style intervals: Bell-Andice-Calf Creek,
Taylor, and Nolan and Travis. The Middle Archaic
is marked by the onset of the Altithermal, a very
warm and dry period. The Bell-Andice-Calf
Creek interval was a moist, mesic period when
grasslands expanded southwards into Central
and South Texas, followed by bison herds from
the Plains. Bell-Andice-Calf Creek peoples were
specialized bison hunters who followed the herds
southwards. As the Altithermal progressed, the
bison and bison hunters retreated northwards.
By the latter part of the Middle Archaic, Taylor
bifaces were replaced by Nolan and Travis
points (Collins 1995, 2004). The Nolan-Travis
interval was also a period when temperature and
aridity were at their greatest levels, and there is
evidence of increased utilization of xerophytes
such as sotol (Johnson and Goode 1994). During
drier episodes, the aquifer-fed streams and
resource-rich environments of Central Texas
were extensively utilized (Story 1985:40; Weir
1976:125, 128).

Early Archaic
Collins and Hester debate the time frame
of the Early Archaic stage in Central Texas.
Hester (1995:436–438, 2004) defines the Early
Archaic with Early Basal Notched and Early
Corner Notched dart points dating between 7950
and 4450 BP, while Collins (1995:383, 2004)
argues that the Early Archaic spans from 8800
to 6000 BP based on three divisions of projectile
point types. It is generally believed that at the
beginning of the Holocene, a warming in climate
led to the extinction of large herds of megafauna
and stimulated behavioral changes of hunters and
gatherers in South-Central Texas (McKinney
1981). A dietary adjustment is evidenced by
the increased number of ground stone artifacts,
burned rock midden cooking features, and more
specialized tools such as Clear Fork gouges and
Guadalupe bifaces (Turner and Hester 1993:246–
256). Early Archaic sites are thinly dispersed and
are seen across a wide area of Texas and northern
Mexico (Weir 1976).

Late Archaic
The Central Texas Late Archaic dates to
approximately 4000–1300/1200 BP (Collins
1995:384, 2004). Herds of bison began returning
to the southern Great Plains, again influencing
the subsistence strategies (Dillehay 1974). Some
believe cemeteries at sites such as Ernest Witte
(Hall 1981) and Olmos Dam (Lukowski 1988)
are evidence that populations increased and
that groups were becoming territorial (Story
1985:44–45). Others challenge the interpretation
by citing a decrease in burned rock middens
(Prewitt 1981:80–81). Pottery began appearing
in limited areas of the South Texas Plains during
this period; however, most regions remained
6

“pre-ceramic” for another thousand years (Story
1985:45–47).

of ceramic styles and influences seen throughout
Toyah phase ceramic assemblages provide
important information on the social composition
of these groups (Arnn 2005). Toyah ceramic
assemblages display Caddo, Texas Gulf Coast,
and Jornada Mogollon influences (Arnn 2005).

Late Prehistoric
Collins (1995, 2004) dates the Late
Prehistoric in Central Texas at 1300/1200–260
BP, and follows Kelley (1947) in dividing it into
Austin and Toyah phases. The most significant
changes include a technological shift away from
the dart and atlatl to the bow and arrow and the
incorporation of pottery (Black 1989:32; Story
1985:45–47).

Protohistoric (Spanish Entrada Period)
In Texas, the Protohistoric period was marked
by Spanish entradas, the formal expeditions
from established forts and missions in Northern
Mexico into Central, Coastal, and East Texas
in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth
centuries. These encounters began with the
venture into Texas by the Spanish explorer
Cabeza de Vaca and the Narvaez expedition in
1528. The period is generally dated between 1500
and 1700 (or from 1528, the date of the Cabeza de
Vaca/Narvaez expedition, to the establishment of
the first Spanish mission, Mission San Antonio
de Valero in 1718).

Austin Phase
The Austin phase is characterized by the
appearance of small arrow points. Burned rock
middens are occasionally found with these types
of points (Houk and Lohse 1993), and ground and
pecked stone tools used for plant food processing
are increasingly common. Burials from this time
reveal a high proportion of arrow-wound deaths
(Black 1989; Meissner 1991; Prewitt 1974),
suggesting that population growth resulted in
disputes over limited resources.

With Alonso de León’s expedition of 1680, El
Camino Real (the King’s Road) was established
from Villa Santiago de la Monclova in Mexico
to East Texas. This roadway followed established
Native American trade routes and trails and
became a vital link between Mission San Juan
Bautista in Northern Mexico and the Spanish
settlement of Los Adaes in East Texas (McGraw
et al. 1991).

Toyah Phase
The beginning of the Toyah phase (800 BP)
in Central Texas is discernible by the appearance
of contracting stem points with flaring, barbed
shouldered points. This phase is also characterized
by the introduction of bladelet technology that
included prismatic blades, blade cores, and
scrapers-on-blades, all considered to be part of a
specialized Toyah bison hunting and processing
toolkit (Black and McGraw 1985; Huebner 1991;
Ricklis 1994). Toyah is also characterized by the
appearance of bone-tempered pottery in Central
Texas (Johnson 1994:241–281). The wide variety

Spanish priests accompanying entradas
provided the most complete information of
indigenous cultures of early Texas. Those
documented during the early entradas include the
Cantona, Muruam, Payaya, Sana, and Yojuane,
who were settled around the springs at San Marcos
and described as semi-nomadic bands. Other
tribes encountered at San Marcos included mobile
hunting parties from villages in South and West
7

Texas, such as Catequeza, Cayanaaya, Chalome,
Cibolo, and Jumano, who were heading for bison
hunting grounds in the Blackland Prairies (Foster
1995:265–289; Johnson and Campbell 1992;
Newcomb 1993). Later groups migrated into the
region and displaced the former groups or tribes.
These included the Tonkawa from Oklahoma and
Lipan and Comanche from the Plains (Campbell
and Campbell 1985; Dunn 1911; Newcomb 1961,
1993).

European presence in the region increased
as settlers received land grants from the Mexican
government until 1835. Settlement was difficult,
however, due to continuation of hostilities with
and raids by Native American tribes. The Texas
Rangers provided protection from these conflicts
after Texas secured independence from Mexico
in 1836.
In terms of the historic record, the region is
known for its record of late historic (late-nineteenth
to early-twentieth centuries) rural settlement.
This pattern includes ranching settlements to the
west of I-35 and farming settlements to the east.
The town of Kyle was established on July 24,
1880, when David E. Moore and Fergus Kyle (for
whom the town was named) deeded 200 acres for
a townsite to the International-Great Northern
Railroad (Storm 1981).

Archaeological sites dated to this period
typically contain a mix of both European
imported goods, such as metal objects and glass
beads, and traditional Native American artifacts,
such as manufactured stone tools.

Historic
Spanish settlement in Central Texas first
occurred in San Antonio with the establishment
of Mission San Antonio de Valero (the Alamo)
in 1718, and the later founding of San Antonio
de Béxar (Bolton 1970; de la Teja 1995; Habig
1977). Some researchers demarcate the transition
in Texas between the Entrada (Protohistoric) and
Historic periods by the construction of the first
Spanish missions in Texas. Most knowledge of
this period is gained through the written records
of the early Spanish missionaries. Besides the
mission town of San Antonio, the only other
Spanish settlement in the region was San Marcos
de Neve, established in 1808, four miles south of
present day San Marcos. San Marcos de Neve was
abandoned in 1812 as a result of constant raids
by local tribes (Dobie 1932). During this time,
massive depopulation occurred among the Native
Americans, mostly due to European diseases to
which the indigenous people had little resistance.
Those few remaining were nearly all displaced to
reservations by the mid-1850s (Fisher 1998).

Methods

Before field work was undertaken, a review
was conducted of the Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas (Atlas), an online database of previously
recorded sites in Texas. This review indicated
that there are no recorded archaeological sites
within or adjacent to the survey area. However,
two previous archaeological surveys have been
conducted nearby. An archaeological investigation
by Marek (2001) reports a linear survey of
approximately five miles of proposed sanitary
sewer lines along Plum Creek, east of Interstate
Highway 35. A thin scatter of lithic debris was
identified along the edge of a plowed field and
historic trash was located in another area. No sites
were recorded and no additional investigations
were recommended. The area in which the lithic
debris was identified is approximately one mile to
8

the east of the project area. A 55
acre tract adjacent to Interstate
Highway 35, just north of Farm
to Market Road 150, was subject
to archaeological survey in 2003
(Boyd and Hammond 2003). No
archaeological sites were located
within the tract and no additional
archaeological
investigations
were recommended for that
project area.

Results

Shovel testing recovered no evidence whatsoever
of any buried deposits, and no prehistoric or
historic artifacts other than the rusted tank
portion were observed on the surface. Based on
the results of this survey, CAS concludes that no
cultural resources are present in the APE that
could be construed as potentially significant to
the City of Kyle’s or the state’s history under any
criteria of the Code.

Scatters of modern trash (plastic bags,
styrofoam cups, etc.) and fence sections attest
to recent disturbance of the project area. One
isolated item of historic metal was identified
and mapped (see Figure 8); it appears to be the
remains of a steel tank of some type (Figure 9).
No other cultural materials were found during
either pedestrian survey or shovel testing.

Based on the absence of any cultural
remains or deposits, no additional cultural
resource investigations are recommended. CAS
recommends that the City of Kyle be given full
authorization to proceed with their planned
development of trails, parks, and green space
along the Plum Creek Preserve.

No artifacts were collected during the course
of this survey. The proposal for this project stated
that diagnostic artifacts would be collected and
other artifacts would be documented; however,
as no artifacts were recovered, these procedures
were not necessary.

Conclusions and
Recommendations

This intensive cultural resources survey
yielded no evidence of cultural remains in the APE
for the Plum Creek Preserve and Nature Trail.
