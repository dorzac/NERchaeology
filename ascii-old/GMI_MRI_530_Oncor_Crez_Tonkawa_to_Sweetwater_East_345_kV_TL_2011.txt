MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Oncor Electric Delivery (Oncor) has proposed construction of a transmission line between the
existing Tonkawa and proposed Sweetwater East electrical substations located northwest and
southeast of Sweetwater beginning in Scurry County continuing across Fisher County, and ending
in Nolan County, Texas, as part of the Competitive Renewable Energy Zone (CREZ) program.
As part of the permitting process for these types of projects, Oncor applied for a Certificate of
Convenience and Necessity from the Public Utility Commission (PUC) of Texas as required by
Section 37.051 of the Texas Utilities Code. PUC requires that Oncor comply with the
requirements of the Texas Historical Commission under the Texas Antiquities Code regarding
cultural resources within proposed rights-of-way. This archaeological survey was initiated in
April 2010 and conducted intermittently through February 2011 as parcels became available, and
testing of seven sites was undertaken in February 2011 after the final corridor route and tower
placements within sites had been established. The architectural study was conducted the week of
3–7 May 2010.
The investigations of the transmission line corridor encompassed a total of 35.1 miles (56.5
kilometers) in length by 160 feet (48.7 meters) in width, comprising approximately 673.5 acres
(272.6 hectares), which included two small reroutes totaling 2.9 miles (49.5 acres [20 hectares]).
A total of 2,8141 shovel tests was excavated along the line and to delineate sites: 2,527 in highprobability areas (approximately 426 acres or 69 percent of the line), 286 in medium-probability
areas (183.7 acres or 30 percent of the line), and one in a low-probability area (6.4 acres or 1
percent of the line) where it intersected with a medium/low boundary.
During the course of the survey, 49 archaeological sites were recorded—34 prehistoric, eight
historic-age sites, and seven sites that contained both prehistoric and historic components.
The boundaries of 33 sites extended beyond the project corridor and thus the sites could not be
fully assessed for National Register of Historic Places significance. Two sites extending beyond
the corridor were recommended not eligible because of being in the former location of a gravel
pit (41NL254) and massive land-disturbing activities (41NL232). The remaining sites extending
beyond the project corridor were considered of unknown eligibility for NRHP inclusion or for
SAL designation.

iii

Eight sites were originally recommended for avoidance or for additional work if avoidance was
not possible. Seven of those sites were tested for NRHP eligibility after the final corridor route
and the placement of towers within the sites was established. Six of those seven sites were
recommended still of unknown eligibility because they extended beyond the project area; the
seventh site was recommended as not eligible for NRHP inclusion because it was contained
within the corridor and thoroughly investigated. The other sites of unknown eligibility were
recommended for no further work within the project corridor. The remaining 16 sites were
constrained to within the project corridor and were recommended as not eligible, with no
additional investigations necessary.
The architectural survey identified 13 properties with historic-age standing structures (some
properties with multiple structures) within the current project 1,000-foot buffer area around the
survey corridor. Only two of these resources (Resources 3 and 4) were associated with
archaeological sites (41FS93 and 41FS96, respectively). None of these resources was
recommended as eligible nor will any be affected by this project. In addition to the sites and
architectural resources, 57 isolated finds were identified: 44 prehistoric materials, 12 historic
materials, and a mussel shell recovery.
All records, photographs, and a limited number of artifacts, primarily diagnostics, are curated at
the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

For a project like this there are always many people who should be recognized for without their
participation this project would not have happened. First and foremost are Tom Trimble of HDR
Engineering and Eric Cook at Oncor. Thanks to Tom for giving us this opportunity and support.
Eric offered much support and guidance throughout the entire project and helped with
coordination between agencies, crews, and Oncor support personnel. Special thanks go to John
Wall and his team of land agents at Universal Field Services, Inc., but especially to Tom
Cummins for the up-to-date field access data and day-to-day responsibility for making sure we
were where we were supposed to be at any given time during the survey—he kept us out of
trouble.
Much appreciation is expressed to those employees that made this project successful. Matt Gill,
who served as the Project Archaeologist and Field Director did a wonderful job of coordinating
with Tom Cummins, Eric Cook, and the four field crews in order to keep the project on track,
kept up with the field paperwork for interim reporting, and also contributed to the report writing.
Field Supervisors for the project included Janet Niessner, Bethany Oliver, Brynn Torelli, and Ray
Tubby, and Brynn also assisted Matt with the weekly paperwork and contributed to the writing.
Bethany assisted in making sure that paperwork and artifacts were delivered every week to the
Geo-Marine lab for analysis and interim reporting. Arlo McKee served as Project Archaeologist
on revisits after the initial survey to the project area and testing of sites that would be impacted by
tower construction with Bethany Oliver again acting as Field Supervisor.
Without the hard work of the field and laboratory crews, this project could never have been
completed. Field and lab crews include Juan Arias, Brad Burkholder, John Comer, Cullom, Ken
Fleming, Ben Fullerton, Anne Gibson, Lisa Hopwood, Leonard Kemp, Chris Kugler, Brett Lang,
Jena Sadd, Dawn Schauer, Lindsey Skelton, Alex Taylor, Olga Torres, and Chris Van Witter.
Also special thanks to Sharlene Allday for doing the prehistoric artifact analysis and Steve Hunt
for the historic artifact analysis, and both for their contributions to the report writing. The
production of the graphics in the report is contributed to Erin King whose patience throughout the
report production process is greatly appreciated. Sharlene Allday did a wonderful job of editing
the report, and Denise Pemberton’s expertise made the report visually pleasing and easy to read.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

Oncor Electric Delivery (Oncor) proposed construction of a transmission line between the
existing Tonkawa and proposed Sweetwater East electrical substations in Scurry, Fisher, and
Nolan counties, Texas (Figure 1). The original transmission route was just over 32 miles in
length, but the final selected transmission line corridor is 31.7 miles (mi; 51 kilometers [km])
long and 160 feet (ft; 48.7 meters [m]) wide comprising 616 acres (ac; 249.3 hectares [ha]), after
several meanders in the line were straightened. This project is part of the Competitive Renewable
Energy Zone (CREZ) program as established by the Texas Legislature in 2005. These CREZs
were developed to help install additional 5,880 megawatts of renewable capacity by 2015 and are
a means to ensure that transmission service providers and wind developers would have the
capacity to guarantee a reciprocal arrangement for constructing wind farms and having a means
of moving that energy elsewhere. As part of the permitting process for these types of projects,
Oncor applied for a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity from the Public Utility
Commission (PUC) of Texas as required by Section 37.051 of the Texas Utilities Code (TUC).
PUC requires that Oncor comply with the requirements of the Texas Historical Commission
(THC) under the Texas Antiquities Code regarding cultural resources within proposed rights-of­
way (PBSJ 2008:1).
HDR Engineering, the contractor hired by Oncor to determine the Tonkawa to Sweetwater East
transmission line route, in turn hired Geo-Marine, Inc. (Geo-Marine project #30008.09.03), to
conduct the cultural resources survey of the preferred transmission corridor. The purpose of this
cultural resources investigation was to provide an inventory to determine the presence/absence of
cultural resources that might be affected by the proposed transmission line construction and to
evaluate all identified resources for their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) and for designation as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL).
The survey investigations of the transmission line corridor, which included a small reroute and a
limited shift or widening of some areas of the original route (totaling 2.9 mi [4.7 km]),
encompassed a total of 35.1 mi (56.5 km) in length by 160 feet (48.7 m) in width, comprising
approximately 673.5 ac (272.6 ha). The western end of the Tonkawa to Sweetwater East
transmission line is located at the existing Tonkawa substation in Scurry County, south of Inadale
and west of County Road (CR) 4153. From there, the line crosses Highway 83 and runs generally
east into Fisher County, until it reaches the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe rail line, prior to
1

the intersection of the railroad and County Road (CR) 443. The line then follows the railroad
southeast into Nolan County and through the outskirts of Sweetwater, turning south to cross
Interstate Highway (IH) 20 at the interchange with State Highway (SH) 70 Business. The line
then turns east, roughly following CR 221 until it reaches the Sweetwater East substation, located
between CR 131 and Stink Creek.
With the exception of a small segment of the line that crosses highway IH-20 and the links into
the substation at each end of the line, all of the parcels that make up the project corridor are on
privately owned property. Of the 65 parcels within the project corridor, full access was initially
provided to 56 parcels. For an additional six parcels, limited access to the property was provided,
allowing a walkover and visual inspection of the surface of the corridor but no subsurface shovel
testing until easements were obtained by Oncor in late 2010. The remaining two parcels consist
of a railway easement and a highway median, where archaeological survey was deemed
unnecessary due to the extensive ground disturbance. Slight reroute areas along the original
corridor for several parcels were established after initial survey. Those reroute areas, along with
parcels for which subsurface shovel test permission was finally obtained, were also investigated
in late 2010 and early 2011.
Initial fieldwork on the Tonkawa to Sweetwater East line was initiated on 19 April 2010 and
completed on 13 July 2010. In addition to the archaeological survey, Architectural Historian
Tanya McDougall documented historic-age structural resources within a 500-ft (152-m) buffer of
each side of the project centerline (a total of 1,000 ft) during the week of 3–7 May 2010;
subsequent to the identification of historic-era sites, the historian also conducted deed-title
research on all historic sites that not dumps of historic-era and modern materials. Matt Gill was
the Project Archaeologist on this project and was assisted by Bethany Oliver, Janet Niessner,
Brynn Torelli, and Ray Tubby as Field Supervisors overseeing a crew of 10. Melissa Green
served as Principal Investigator. On subsequent visits—29 September, 1 October, 8 December–
21 December 2010, and from 10–12 January and 8–18 February 2011—after permission for
subsurface investigations was obtained, Arlo McKee served as Project Archaeologist, assisted by
Bethany Oliver as Field Supervisor.

CHAPTER 2
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

The Tonkawa to Sweetwater East project area is situated in generally level uplands in what is
described by Fenneman (1931) as the southern part of the Great Plains province. This area is
often divided into the High Plains and the Lower Plains, with the Llano Estacado and the
Canadian River valley falling into the southernmost portion of the High Plains, and the Lower
Plains consisting mainly of undulating hills adjoining to the east (Boyd and Tomka 1997a:7).
Perttula (2004:Figure 1.2) refers to the latter area as the Rolling Plains. However, Boyd and
Tomka (1997a:7) further delineate this southern area of the Great Plains in Texas, the Lower
Plains, into two subregions: the Caprock Canyonlands on the western side (between the Llano
Estacado to the west and the Rolling Plains to the east), and the Rolling Plains on the eastern
edge. Nolan County falls within both Lower Plains and Caprock Canyonlands zones.

GEOLOGY AND SOILS
The majority of the underlying geology is Permian-age Whitehorse Sandstone followed by
Tertiary Ogallala Formation, and pockets of Triassic Quartermaster Formation near Cottonwood
Creek and its tributaries and Pleistocene and Holocene windblown sand, alluvium, fluviatile
terrace deposits and Quaternary deposits undivided around Killdoogan, Sweetwater, Bitter, Little
Stink, and Stink creeks. Pockets of Pleistocene Playa deposits were also mapped within the
Ogallala Formation portion of the project area (Bureau of Economic Geology 1994).
The project area crosses three counties, so the soils are discussed by county starting from west to
east. In Scurry County, the only soil association encountered is the Rowena-Abilene-Olton.
These are deep, nearly level to gently sloping, well-drained, moderately slowly permeable, loamy
soils. About 51 percent of the association is made up of the Rowena-Abilene complex with about
33 percent Olton soils and the remaining 16 percent minor soils. Rowena and Abilene soils are
brown and dark grayish brown clay loams that have lower layers of clay and clay loam
respectively. Typically, Olton soils are brown to reddish brown clay loams that have lower layers
of reddish-brown clay loam to clay. About 85 percent of these soils are in cultivation, with the
remaining used for rangeland (Dixon et al. 1973:2).

5

As the line crosses into Fisher County, the soil associations encountered are Abilene-Acme;
Mansker-Potter, Carey-Woodward, and very small pockets of Miles-Travessilla. The AbileneAcme soils are nearly level loam soils found on uplands that in some areas overlie beds of impure
gypsum. The surface layer of Abilene soils are dark-colored clay loam with a subsoil of dark
brown to dark grayish-brown clay with a substratum of strongly calcareous clay. These soils
make up 77 percent of this association (Delozier et al. 1966:6). Masker-Potter soils are gently
sloping to steep, medium-textured limy soils on slopes along and below the plateau in the
southwestern part of the county; it resembles an escarpment. Masker soils, strongly calcareous
with beds of caliche 51 to 63 centimeters (cm; 20–25 inches [in]) thick, occupy about half of this
association. Shallow Potter soils on convex slopes make up about 20 percent, with minor soils
making up the remainder of the association (Delozier et al. 1966:7).
Carey-Woodward association soils are gently sloping to moderately sloping, deep and moderately
deep loamy soils on uplands cut by drainages that are well or moderately well defined. The
typical surface profile of Carey soils is a reddish-brown loam with a subsoil of reddish-brown
friable sandy clay loam. These soils occupy about 54 percent of the association and are on nearly
level to strongly rolling upland. The surface profile of Woodward soils are similar to Carey
except that it is slightly more sandy and is calcareous, with a subsoil layer of yellowish red loam
in the lower part. These soils are about 61 to 137 cm (24–54 in) deep over red-bed material and
occupy about 25 percent of the association. Minor soils make up the rest of the association
(Delozier et al. 1966:2).
Lastly, the Miles-Travessilla are gently sloping and strongly sloping to steep rock outcrops, and
deep to very shallow moderately coarse textured soils on ridges and knobs. The primary soils are
the Miles, which have a surface layer of reddish-brown to light brown fine sandy loam and loamy
fine sand over a subsoil of reddish-brown, friable sandy clay loam. About 45 percent of the
association is made up of these soils. Travessilla soils consist of 15 cm (6 in) of gravelly sandy
loam that overlies conglomerate rock or sandstone. These soils and escarpments make up about
25 percent of the association with the remainder made up of minor soils (Delozier et al. 1966:5–
6).
Only two soil associations are encountered in Nolan County: Woodward-Quinlan-Burson and a
small portion of Sagerton-Rotan-Cobb. Woodward-Quinlan-Burson soils are very shallow to
moderately deep, gently sloping to hilly, loamy soils that formed in Permian-age silty and loamy
beds and are found on highly dissected knolls, ridges, steep-sided draws, creeks, and gullies.
Twenty-eight percent of this soils unit is made up of Woodward soils with Quinlan soils
accounting for 23 percent, Burson soils about 13 percent, and the remaining 36 percent made up
of minor soils. Woodward soils are gently sloping and on uplands are calcareous, reddish brown
loam to about 79 cm (31 in) deep over weakly cemented, calcareous sandstone The Quinlan soils
are gently to strongly sloping, found on uplands, and are calcareous, reddish brown loam about
33 cm (13 in) deep. Burson soils are calcareous, red loam found on hills and ridges. It is about
18 cm (7 in) thick and overlays red, weakly cemented calcareous sandstone that is also
interbedded with silty and sandy materials (Lowther 1981:6).
Sagerton-Rotan-Cobb soils are deep and moderately deep, nearly level to gently sloping, loams
soils found on broad outwash plains that formed in Quaternary-period calcareous loamy
sediments. Sagerton soils make up about 40 percent of the association followed by 11 percent
Rotan soils, 7 percent Cobb soils, and minor soils making up the remainder. Sagerton soils are
nearly level to gently sloping on broad uplands. The typical surface layer is a 25-cm (10-in)
6

brown clay loam over a 134-cm (53-in) brownish to reddish clay ending in 173 cm (68 in) of light
red clay loam that is 20 percent calcium carbonate. Rotan soils are on nearly level and gently
sloping uplands. The typical surface profile is 38 cm (15 in) of brownish clay loam over 76 cm
(30 in) of brownish clay ending in reddish yellow clay loam with 20 percent calcium carbonate
for about 167 cm (66 in). Lastly, Cobb oils are gently sloping on uplands with a typical surface
profile of reddish brown fine sandy loam about 18 cm (7 in) thick over 96 cm (38 in) of brownish
to reddish sandy clay loam with an underlying layer of red, weakly cemented sandstone (Lowther
1981:7).

FLORA AND FAUNA
The project area falls within the Mesquite Plains district of the Kansan province as described by
Blair (1950). This district is bounded by the Western Cross Timbers to the east, by the exposed
Comanchean Cretaceous limestones of the Edwards Plateau to the south, and by the escarpment
of the High Plains to the west (Blair 1950:109–110).
The most extensive plant association of the Mesquite Plains district is a mesquite-grass
association characterized by open stands of mesquite and a few other shrubs alternating with a
substantial cover of grasses. The principal grass cover consists of various species of grama and
three-awn. Broomweed and gaillardia are also abundant, as are other various forbs. Various
species of trees, including oaks, elms, hackberries, and maples, extend along stream floodplains
and exist in steep-walled canyons in the western part of the district (Blair 1950:111). Other
plants common to the area are lotebrush, shin oak, sumac, Texas prickly pear, tasajillo, kidney
wood, agarito, redbud, yucca, Lindheimer silktassel, sotol, catclaw, Mexican persimmon,
buffalograss, and hairy tridens (McMahon et al. 1984:10).
Characteristic mammals of the Kansan province include black-footed ferret, spotted skunk,
striped skunk, badger, coyote, spotted ground squirrel, black-tailed prairie dog, yellow-faced
pocket gopher, hispid pocket mouse, silky pocket mouse, white-footed mouse, southern plains
woodrat, black-tailed jackrabbit, desert cottontail, and at one time, bison. Other important
mammals present in the area, now and in the past, include porcupine, black bear, raccoon,
ringtail, red fox, cougar, collared peccary, mule deer, and white-tailed deer (Schmidly 1983,
1984).
The only land turtle known in the Kansan province is the western box turtle. Fourteen species of
lizards are known from the area, although none is restricted to it. These include Texas horned
lizard, spiny lizard, collared lizard, and greater fine-lined skink. Thirty-one species of snakes are
identified in the Kansan province, including common coachwhip, red-bellied water snake, rat
snake, gopher snake, common garter snake, ribbon snake, black racer, western diamondback
rattlesnake, and western rattlesnake (Blair 1950:112).

CLIMATE
The climate of in this area is characterized by alternating mild and very cool winters and hot
summers (Lowther 1981:2). Average temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit (°F) range from the low
40s in January to the low 80s in July (Southern Regional Climate Center [SRCC] 2008). Cold
7

fronts sweep the area repeatedly causing sharp drops in temperature, but the area becomes mild
very quickly. High daytime temperatures up to 100°F+ prevail for a long period in summer, but
most nights are comfortable. Prevailing winds are southerly to southeasterly with the strongest
winds in the winter and early spring due to low-pressure centers that occur over the Texas and
Oklahoma panhandles. Dust storms sometimes occur in spring when strong winds blow over
unprotected soils. Tornadoes and severe thunderstorms occur occasionally, some with hail, but
these storms are generally local and of short duration with patterns of damage variable and spotty.
Average yearly precipitation is 23.5 inches with 70 percent of that falling between April and
September (Lowther 1981:2).
These climatic conditions and geological substrates have produced a rough landscape of breaks
and bluffs, with patches of shallow soil where low gradients offer some measure of stability.

CHAPTER 3
CULTURAL SETTING

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (10,000–6500 B.C.)
Although hints of human occupation prior to 15,000 years have been found throughout the
Americas (Goebel et al. 2008), the first well-established occupations of the central United States
continue to be the hunting-and-gathering Paleoindian cultures of Clovis and Folsom, as well as
slightly later regional variations such as Firstview and Plainview (Johnson and Holliday 1995).
Paleoindian peoples reached the Texas Panhandle-Plains region around 11,000 years ago (Table
1) when temperatures throughout the Americas dropped in a climatic event referred to as the
Younger Dryas. The Younger Dryas may have brought about wetter conditions in the region,
allowing for occupation by “. . . large animals and the people who pursued them” (Carlson
2005:32).

In adjacent areas, much of the Paleoindian and Archaic record has likely been erased by largescale regional erosion (Blum et al. 1992; Boyd 1997a). The Cretaceous bluffs of the Callahan
Divide, the range of hills separating the Brazos River basin from the Colorado River basin that
extend 26 miles from west to southeast through Taylor and Callahan counties immediately east of
the project area, resisted these processes, leaving more of the archaeological record intact. In
addition to aiding preservation, these deposits are also relevant to settlement patterns in terms of
resource availability. One of the key characteristics of geologic outcrops in the greater Edwards
Plateau region is the ubiquity of fine-grained, highly workable chert cobbles (Banks 1990).
Lithics from the Yellow Hawk site in Taylor County, in the eastcentral section of the study area,
suggest that the use of this chert for stone tools dates to Paleoindian times (Carpenter et al. 2006).
Paleoindian occupations are known primarily through the presence of distinctive fluted projectile
points. For this reason, it is difficult to classify Paleoindian sites, especially when they are
identified through isolated projectile point finds. In addition, inconsistencies in site recording
have led to a number of sites lacking enough information to determine cultural affiliation
(Bousman et al. 2004). Among the best-known and best-preserved Paleoindian sites in Texas are
the Lubbock Lake Landmark site (Lubbock County) and the Plainview site (Hale County) in the
Panhandle, Baker Cave and Bonfire Shelter (Val Verde County) in the Lower Pecos region, and
the Aubrey site (Denton County) in Northcentral Texas. Sites with known Paleoindian material
in the northwestern portion of Central Texas tend to be clustered in the vicinity of Abilene.
According to the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) maintained by the THC, Paleoindian
material has been found at numerous sites in the surrounding vicinity of the project area: 22 sites
in Fisher County; four in Nolan County; one in Scurry County; three in Taylor County, and two
in Jones County. Most of these materials, however, have been recovered as surface finds and not
from intact buried contexts. This cluster of sites likely relates more to the concentrated efforts of
early researchers in the area than actual Paleoindian occupation patterns (Bousman et al. 2004).
Despite the problems associated with identifying and classifying Paleoindian sites, the efforts of
early researchers and more-recent archaeological investigations in the Panhandle-Plains region
have yielded significant evidence of Paleoindian subsistence strategies. Faunal data from
Paleoindian sites across Texas indicate that Paleo peoples had a generalized subsistence base that
included both large-game (mammoth and bison) and small-game (gopher, shrew, mole, rabbit,
prairie dog, squirrel, vole, etc.) mammals, as well as fish, birds, reptiles, and amphibians
(Bousman et al. 2004; Carlson 2005).
The Paleoindian period was marked by a relatively cool and wet environment. That environment
was followed by the Altithermal, a proposed climatic period exhibiting warmer and drier
conditions than the previous era (Boyd and Tomka 1997a; Carlson 2005). The Altithermal lasted
from approximately 5500–2500 B.C. (Nance 1972), spanning the Early and Middle Archaic
periods and bringing about changes in settlement and subsistence strategies.

ARCHAIC PERIOD (6500 B.C.–A.D. 500)
Throughout the Americas, Archaic adaptations are characterized by a continuation of hunting and
gathering lifeways but with several modifications: the concentration of subsistence activities
within smaller territories, the repeated exploitation of specific resource areas in a seasonal round,
the hunting and trapping of smaller game animals, and the development of specialized tool
assemblages for processing a greater range of foods, especially plants. Many of these
modifications may have been influenced by the environmental changes of the Altithermal period
10

during which the study area became warmer and drier than it had previously been. The Archaic
period is generally divided into the Early, Middle, and Late subperiods, and a
Transitional/Terminal Archaic subperiod occurs at the end of the Late Archaic (see Table 1).

Early Archaic (6500–4500 B.C.)
Burned rock middens emerged as one of the signature archaeological features of the Archaic in
Central Texas, with examples dating to nearly 5000 B.C. (Lintz et al. 2008). The origins and
functions of such features have been disputed, with some arguing that they indicate distinctively
Archaic processing of plant foods such as sotol bulbs; recently, Collins (2004) has argued that the
search for a single explanation is counterproductive, that concentrations of fire-altered rock
undoubtedly resulted from various cooking and resource-processing activities.
Though the dates and affiliations are unknown, numerous burned rock features have recently been
documented in the study area (Carpenter et al. 2006; Nash et al. 2001). Unfortunately, the lack of
consistency in descriptions hampers analysis; researchers apply terms such as “burned rock
midden,” “rock oven,” “rock hearth,” “fire-cracked rock,” and others to a wide range of features
that may or may not be comparable (Collins 2004; Lintz et al. 2008). Early Archaic projectile
points were stemmed, a departure from the lanceolate forms of the Paleoindian period.

Middle Archaic (4500–2000 B.C.)
Middle Archaic sites are present in the region surrounding the study area. In particular, the
Lubbock Lake site in the nearby High Plains region has yielded information about the lifeways of
Middle Archaic peoples in Central Texas. For instance, at the Lubbock Lake site, early
populations excavated wells to cope with the continuation of dry conditions first noted in the
Early Archaic period (Carpenter et al. 2006). The economy of the Middle Archaic period
changed little from the preceding era. There were, however, changes in projectile point styles
(Godwin et al. 2001).
Middle Archaic projectile points types, although still stemmed as during the Early Archaic, were
more diverse. The most common forms were projectile points with contracting stems and
straight, rounded, or pointed bases and those with expanding stems with concave bases (Miller
and Kenmotsu 2004:225). In addition to changes in lithic technology, Middle Archaic peoples
increased the use of structures such as pithouses (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004).

Late Archaic (2000–0 B.C.)
Around 2000 B.C., climatic conditions once more began to change. The warm, dry Altithermal
began to give way to the more mesic conditions of the Medithermal period (Acuña et al. 2003).
As the climate began to cool and conditions became moister, the environment of the PanhandlePlains became more stable. Wind erosion lessened during this period while mixed grass prairies
replaced the plains grasslands of the Middle Archaic (Carpenter et al. 2006).

11

Two archaeological manifestations, the Little Sunday complex and the Summers complex,
represent the Late Archaic in the Panhandle-Plains. However, according to Boyd (1997a:234)
these complexes do not adequately portray “what is now known for the Late Archaic period.”
Because of this, Boyd (1997b) has attempted to further define the Little Sunday complex, of
which known sites are throughout the Panhandle-Plains. Late Archaic Little Sunday complex
sites include bison kill sites, campsites, rockshelters, and burials. At the time of his research,
Boyd noted that bison kill sites were absent from the Caprock Canyonlands, generally described
as the area from the eastern edge of the Caprock to the Rolling Plains farther to the east.
However, numerous campsites were identified in the region, often on mesa tops. Most of these
Late Archaic sites have been identified through surface finds (Boyd 1997a).
Late Archaic burial sites in the Caprock Canyonlands sometimes contain lunate stones. Lunate
stones are lithic artifacts with a half moon shape. They have alternately been referred to as
cariniform atlatl weights; however, this terminology is frequently rejected as it implies a definite
function for an artifact whose function is debatable (Boyd 1997b; Thurmond 1989:246).
Regardless of their function, lunate stones appear to be associated with Late Archaic occupations
in the region.

Terminal Archaic (A.D. 0–500)
The Terminal Archaic was a transitional period during which new technologies such as the bow
and arrow and ceramics were introduced and used concurrently with older technologies such as
dart points (Boyd 1997b). Many sites within the Panhandle-Plains exhibit materials from both
the Archaic and subsequent Late Prehistoric periods, but few of these sites have yielded
diagnostic points or ceramics in well-dated contexts (Boyd 1997b:267).
During the Terminal Archaic period, there was a shift in lithic technologies from the use of dart
points to the use of arrow points. Boyd suggests that the appearance of the bow and arrow and
ceramics in the region indicates “the arrival of new peoples and/or ideas and influences.” He also
asserts that the first substantial evidence of violence in the Panhandle-Plains region is found
among eight (or possibly nine) of 11 Terminal Archaic burials representing people who were
killed, perhaps precipitated by intercultural conflicts with newly arriving groups or increasing
population pressure or both (Boyd 1997a:266, 270). While different groups of people were
finding their way into the area and new technologies were being introduced, it appears that bison
populations were decreasing (Boyd 2004). This trend continued into the Late Prehistoric period.

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 500–1540)
The Late Prehistoric period is usually defined by the sustained use of ceramics—often interpreted
as evidence of more permanent settlement—and the bow and arrow, which allowed safer, more
efficient hunting (Boyd and Tomka 1997b; Godwin et al. 2001). In the study area, however, the
advent of the Late Prehistoric is marked only by arrow points, not ceramics, via the Blow Out
Mountain complex (Boyd 1997b). Little is known about this cultural phenomenon, which
consists archaeologically of hearths, scattered lithics, and a few burials. It is presumed to
represent a population of “generalized hunter-gatherers” who focused on smaller animals instead
of bison (Boyd 1997b:280).

12

Late Prehistoric I (A.D. 500–1000)
The focus on smaller animals instead of bison may have been influenced by a decrease in the
bison population around the time of the Late Prehistoric I period. Boyd (2004) suggests that a
general decline in the number of bison may have occurred in the Southern Plains around A.D. 500
with numbers remaining low until about A.D. 1200 (Dillehay 1974; Hughes 1991:8, 30). This
decline in bison population may have occurred concurrent with or just after the westward
movement of eastern Woodland cultures and the eastward movement of Southwestern Puebloan
cultures. These cultural traditions met in the Caprock Canyonlands region, which appears to have
played a significant role in “cultural developments and interactions during the first millennium
A.D.” (Boyd 2004:296).
The most extensive Late Prehistoric culture in the project area was the Palo Duro complex, which
stretched northward from Howard County (just west of Nolan County) to Hutchison County (in
the northern Panhandle) through the central Panhandle. This complex, first identified at
Mackenzie Reservoir (Willey and Hughes 1978), apparently represents a widespread culture
characterized by early corner- and basal-notched arrow points and Mogollon brownwares (Boyd
1997b:295). Additionally, the earliest habitation structures in the form of pithouses as well as
storage pits, baking pits, and bedrock mortars at residential base sites are associated with this
complex. A rockshelter, three campsites, and a residential base camp attributed to the Palo Duro
complex have been recorded in Garza and Kent counties, immediately north of Scurry County.
Toward the end of the Late Prehistoric I period a “brief but intensive region-wide drying trend”
marked the transition to the Late Prehistoric II period (Boyd 1997c:337). This climatic shift
corresponds to an increase in bison populations and may have been the driving force behind Late
Prehistoric II changes in subsistence and settlement patterns (Boyd 1997c).

Late Prehistoric II (A.D. 1000–1540)
During the second half of the Late Prehistoric period, a new projectile point type became
prevalent. The appearance of side-notched triangular points marks the start of the Late
Prehistoric II period (Acuña et al. 2003; Boyd 1997c). At the same time, bison populations began
to rise following a period of general decline. This new point technology along with increasing
numbers of bison led to Late Prehistoric II people relying heavily on bison for subsistence. In
addition, they continued seasonal gathering and practiced limited horticulture (Acuña et al. 2003).
Many, though not all, Late Prehistoric II cultures began to make a change from mobile hunting
and gathering to a more sedentary lifestyle. These were the groups incorporating horticulture into
their subsistence patterns and transitioning from pithouse to pueblo settlements. Boyd (1997c)
suggests that numerous social, political, and economic changes occurred in Central Texas and
surrounding areas during the Late Prehistoric II period. These changes included the
abovementioned shifts toward greater reliance on bison, limited horticulture, and a semisedentary lifestyle. However, Boyd also posits that increased human populations coupled with
increased sedentism allowed for the development of reciprocal trade between groups and
ultimately led to the introduction of territorial boundaries and possible warfare on the eve of
European contact (Boyd 1997c:339).

13

The study area is considered part of a “shared area” between two poorly defined cultural
complexes: Garza to the north and Toyah to the south (Boyd 1997c:Figure 96). Both of these
vague archaeological assemblages became clearest during the fourteenth through the seventeenth
centuries A.D., into the succeeding Protohistoric period. Toyah settlements are considered part of
the regional Plains Village tradition, with at least some maize cultivation supplementing bison
hunting, which was carried out using distinctive Perdiz points (Boyd 1997c). Garza populations,
on the other hand, seem to have been more mobile and more focused on bison hunting, using
point types such as Garza and Lott. Garza people moved seasonally among rockshelters, hunting
camps, and kill sites, caching dried meat and plants in ceramic vessels, some of them imported
from the Pueblo area to the west and the Caddo area to the east (Boyd 1997c). A caveat that must
be kept in mind is that this discussion implies that Garza and Toyah materials represent different
people, a point that has not been fully established.

PROTOHISTORIC AND EARLY HISTORIC PERIODS (A.D. 1540–1950)
The Protohistoric period began with the arrival of the first Europeans in the area, Coronado’s
1540–1542 expedition to the Plains of Cibola, the High Plains west of the study area (Castañeda
1554[1904]). Coronado’s chroniclers and those of later Spanish expeditions (e.g., Posada
1686[1982]) report that the region was occupied by Apacha (Apache) people. Based on Spanish
descriptions of Apache lifeways—with limited sedentism and a seasonal round of bison hunting
and foraging—it seems that the Garza and Toyah archaeological complexes may represent early
Apache occupations (Boyd 1997c). In an alternative interpretation that has not yet gained
traction in the Texas archaeological community, Garza and other Late Prehistoric and
Protohistoric assemblages have also been linked to the Wichita (Baugh and Perkins 2008; Roberts
and Bradford 1997).
If Garza and/or Toyah indeed represent early Apache occupations, the Apache were the primary
native group in the area until the early to mid-eighteenth century, when nomadic Comanche
hunters arrived from the Great Basin and plains northwest of Texas (Lipscomb 2008). Various
Anglo, French, and Spanish traders maintained commercial relationships with the Apache and
Comanche, but the locations and timing of these interactions are debated; for instance, sites of the
Spanish traders known as comancheros have not been securely identified because “no one is sure
what they should look like” (Freeman and Boyd 1997:82).
The Comanche dominated the area until the 1870s, when the U.S. Army began a large-scale
assault on native groups of the Texas Panhandle-Plains region, surrounding them with a ring of
forts. In 1874, the Red River Wars—a series of running battles between U.S. Army forces and
Comanche, Kiowa, and Cheyenne communities—occurred in the northern portion of the Caprock
Canyonlands. Systematic archaeological study of these events, which left material traces such as
Native American and U.S. Army camps, scattered graves, dumps, and battlegrounds, has only
recently begun (for further detail see Cruse 2008).
As Native American groups were decimated or driven out of the Texas Panhandle-Plains area,
Anglo-American settlers and buffalo hunters moved in. The study area is located on what was
the southern edge of an enormous buffalo herd, one of two occupying the central United States: a
northern one in the Dakotas, Montana, and Wyoming, and a southern one that extended from
Texas into New Mexico, Oklahoma, Colorado, Kansas, and Nebraska (Freeman and Boyd 1997).
These herds were nearly exterminated after just a few years of Anglo-American industrial-scale
14

slaughter. The archaeological evidence of these activities includes camps, butchering sites, and
relatively informal trading posts, all ephemeral and therefore difficult to find (Freeman and Boyd
1997). Near the study area, hunting camps and trading posts were established at Snyder in Scurry
County, Colorado City in Mitchell County, and Sweetwater in Nolan County (Freeman and Boyd
1997).
Evidence of pastoralism dominates the archaeological record from the end of the buffalo-hunting
era in the 1870s until the early 1920s. In the 1870s and early 1880s, Hispanic sheepherders or
pastores tended sheep on state rangelands, leaving distinctive clues such as canals, corner
fireplaces, adobe blocks, and plazas surrounded by structures in the built environment (Freeman
and Boyd 1997). After 1890, the economy of the area focused on cattle ranching, on the open
range before 1900 and within fenced properties after 1900. Many ranchers and their families
lived in dugout houses (dwelling shelters that were excavated into a hillside slope and usually
roofed with blocks of sod, or logs when available), “the most common property type or feature
associated with ranching across the entire region” (Freeman and Boyd 1997:93). As large cattle
ranches were partitioned into smaller properties, ranching gave way to farming, a fundamental
component of the economy today (Dethloff and Nall 2008; Griffith et al. 2004; Leffler 2008).
Oil was discovered in Nolan and neighboring counties in the 1920s and 1930s, and thousands of
wells were drilled over the next several decades (Amin and Leffler 2008; Leffler 2008; McDaniel
2010; Shelton 2010). Although oil exploration and production now date back nearly 90 years in
the region, oil industry facilities have not been investigated from an archaeological or historical
perspective, and “it remains to be seen what the research potential of such sites may be”
(Freeman and Boyd 1997:98). Similarly, gypsum has been mined in and near the northern part of
the study area since at least the 1920s (McDaniel 2010), but facilities associated with gypsum
extraction have not been investigated.

NOLAN AND FISHER COUNTIES HISTORIC CONTEXT
The majority of the Tonkawa–Sweetwater project area falls within Nolan and Fisher counties,
with a small portion located in the southeast corner of Scurry County. These counties all share
similar settlement stories—stories of hunting buffalo, raising cattle, discovering oil, harnessing
wind. Located in westcentral Texas west of Abilene, the area has long been tied to its land.

Early Settlement
Defined by its rolling prairie and open grasslands, Fisher and Nolan counties both drain into the
Clear Fork of the Brazos River. The area was first described in 1541 when explorer Francisco
Vázquez de Coronado wrote to the king of Spain:
I reached some plains so vast, that I did not find their limit anywhere I went, although I travelled over
them for more than 300 leagues . . . with no more land marks than if we had been swallowed up by the
sea . . . there was not a stone, nor bit of rising ground, nor a tree, nor a shrub, nor anything to go by
[Leatherwood 2010].

The Lipan Apache populated this area until the early eighteenth century prior to the Comanche
and Kiowa invasions from the north; the Pawnee, Wichita, and Waco also occasionally hunted in
the Brazos Valley as well (Shelton 2010). The groups would travel between the plains and
15

Central Texas using the Old Indian Trail, which crossed from northwest to southeast across
Fisher County (Figure 2). In 1847, U.S. Army Capt. Randolph B. Marcy traveled along the Old
Indian Trail on his way south to El Paso, and in 1856, the area earned some additional acclaim
when Gen. Robert E. Lee passed through while fighting the Comanche (Shelton 2010).
Fisher, Nolan, and Scurry are among 55 counties that were created from the Young-Bexar
Territory by the Texas legislature on August 21, 1876. The Franco-Texan Land Company owned
approximately 600,000 acres of land in 10 of these counties, which included almost all of
southern Fisher and northern Nolan, in 1876. At that time, the only residents in the area were
temporary or traveling through. In 1877, Billie Knight opened a store on the banks of Sweetwater
Creek for nearby ranchers and hunters; the dugout was stocked with all the essentials—food
items, medicine, ammunition, and tobacco (Taylor 1969:192). A post office was opened two
years later and was known officially as “Sweet Water” by postal authorities until 1918
(Hunt2010). The post office and other tent stores were relocated to the site of the Texas and
Pacific Railway (T&P) depot around the time the county was incorporated and Sweetwater
became its seat in 1881 (Figure 3). The Franco-Texan Land Company owned the depot site,
Section 47, at that time, but conveyed it to the T&P on March 18, 1882. On August 1 of that
same year, T&P filed its map of the new town of Sweetwater (Yeats and Shelton 1975:60).

As with Nolan County, permanent settlers in Fisher were sparse prior to 1876. The first post
office was established in 1881, and the county was officially organized in 1886. Named after
Samuel Rhoads Fisher, a signer of the Texas Declaration of Independence and secretary of the
Texas Navy, its two towns at that time were Roby and Fisher (now North Roby). Roby won the
county seat contest, but many questioned its legitimacy, especially after one of the voters was
revealed to not be a resident, but instead the dog of a Roby resident (Shelton 2010). Early settlers
came from Travis and Williamson counties and from areas in East and North Texas. People in
both counties were outnumbered by cattle in the 1880 census. Nolan County had a population of
600, and Fisher, 136, while cattle in each county numbered above 24,000 (McDaniel 2010;
Shelton 2010). Today, Nolan County has a population of approximately 15,800 people, and
Fisher County numbers approximately 4,300.
A large network of farm-to-market or ranch-to-market roads was established early on as well.
These became more important as land was divided and areas fenced off. Early roads included
routes between Sweetwater and the towns of Abilene, San Angelo, and Roby. In 1924, bonds
were passed to pave Nolan County highways in Sweetwater from all directions, and underpasses
and overpasses were built near the train tracks (Yeats and Shelton 1975:48). This better
connected the area to surrounding counties and amenities.

17

Farming and Ranching
The majority of settlers traveling those early roads into the area were farmers and ranchers. Fiftytwo ranches dotted the landscape in Nolan County by 1880. Population was growing steadily and
the area was thriving. The land was divided into several larger ranches at that time. It is known
that one such ranch, the 18 Ranch, was located in the western part of Fisher County as well as
parts of Scurry and Nolan counties and included land surrounding the towns of Hermleigh, Roby,
Camp Springs, and Rotan. This ranch was established in 1881 by five pioneers—R. M. Clayton,
T. A. Dunn, L. Glasscock, C. Roy, and A. Scott—with small herds of cattle (Yeats and Shelton
n.d.:20). Together, this venture represented the Colorado Cattle Company. The 300 sections of
land they used belonged mostly to the public schools and railroad companies. Over time, the
ranch was divided into a number of smaller ones. By 1913, only 40 of the 300 sections were
occupied by the ranch, then owned by W. Lanius, a settler in the area (Yeats and Shelton n.d.:84).
Shortly after the 18 Ranch was established, a blizzard swept through the entire area in 1885
killing the majority of livestock, and a drought followed in 1886–1887 (Yeats and Shelton
1975:64). Sweetwater historian Royston C. Crane described the event this way:
. . . a ‘norther’ came swooping down with freezing, bitter winds. Stock raisers lost 75 percent of their
cattle and 95 percent of the sheep. The Colorado Cattle Co. was holding 13,000 head of cattle in the
neighborhood of present day Claytonville. The man in charge whom I knew well in later years wrote
me that he held the cattle as long as he could . . . [but] drifting herds from the north came down like
an avalanche and carried his 12,000 cattle with them. The drifting cattle died by the thousands.
Cattlemen hunted their stock to the mouth of the Pecos. That was the end of the booming days of the
cattlemen [Abilene Reporter-News (ARN) 1953:7-B].

Despite these conditions, Fisher County grew to have more than 300 ranches in 1890, and Nolan
had 144. To accommodate livestock passing through Sweetwater, a well was drilled and a large
windmill erected at the northwest corner of the public square around that time (Figure 4).
Rancher and businessman Major Willa V. Johnson reportedly introduced the first windmills to
West Texas in the early 1880s (Wolfe 1986:80). The windmill was by far one of the most
significant developments in the farming and ranching industry in the nineteenth and twentieth
centuries. Encouraging settlement in the area, windmills supplied water to arid lands and
livestock, and vitality to newly formed towns and communities (Wolfe 1986:80). The windmill
meant people could settle in areas farther from creeks and work larger portions of their land. One
of the earliest documented users of the windmill in Texas was the Houston Tap and Brazoria
Railroad, which used Ohio resident John Mitchell’s patented Self-Regulating Wind Mill along
approximately 50 miles of its right-of-way between Houston and Wharton, Texas (Baker
1985:26). Windmills began appearing on private ranches around the same time that barbed wire
was invented (the early 1870s) and land was divided into private holdings. Most people,
therefore, had their own wells and windmills on their property and had underground cisterns for
drinking water (Yeats and Shelton 1975:64).
Many of the early windmills were primitive and often handmade, but they provided a vital link to
the land—whether it be for pumping water, powering machines, or generating electricity—that
eventually no farmer or rancher could be without. The most common commercial windmills used
in West Texas were the Eclipse, Flint and Walling Star, U.S. Wind Engine, Axtell’s Standard,
Challenge, Samson, Aermotor, Dempster, and Monitor (Wolfe 1986:82). Today, although many
windmills can still be seen on the landscape, much larger industrialized wind machines are
present as well. Wind turbines, which extract energy from the wind, are located throughout
18

Museum, Sweetwater, Texas).

Fisher, Nolan, and Scurry counties. The turbines are typically three-bladed, rise approximately
200–300 feet above the ground, and are located in wind farms or on private land. Statewide,
wind energy has continued to be a success in recent years. In fact, Texas now ranks sixth in wind
power, behind Germany, the U.S. as a whole, Spain, India, and China (Bogo 2010).
As the twentieth century approached, ranching eventually gave way to farming as the primary
economic force in these rural counties (Figure 5). By the turn of the century, roughly two-thirds
of the ranches present in Fisher County in 1890 had disappeared. Instead of sheep and cattle,
fields were now filled with corn, oats, wheat, and cotton. By 1910, cotton and wheat dominated
the landscape (Shelton 2010). High market prices drove many farmers to plant more cotton in the
1920s, increasing popularity of the area and the number of new settlers. That was also the time
that Sweetwater opened its first municipal airport (1929), attracting even more attention to the
county. The airport later became the World War II training facility for the Women’s Airforce
Service Pilots (WASPs) in 1943. Land prices were high at that time as well, making farm
tenancy very popular. In fact, by 1930, more than half of the farmers in Fisher County were
tenant farmers, meaning they were working someone else’s land (Shelton 2010). Similarly, in
Nolan County, farm tenancy, or sharecropping, increased from 20.5 percent to 54.7 percent in
1910 alone. The Great Depression in the 1930s shook the local farming industry, but World War
II helped revive the area in the 1940s. In addition, the discovery of oil and mining of local
gypsum added much to the local economy.

Railroads
Several railroads were making their way into westcentral Texas in the late 1800s, and most of
them made connections through Sweetwater. The T&P began service to Nolan and Fisher
counties in 1881. This improved accessibility to these areas and encouraged further settlement.
By the end of that year, the line connected to El Paso and effectively connected the East and West
coasts (Kilmon 1981:98). Another railway, the Orient of Texas, had lines in these counties as
well. Originally chartered as the Colorado Valley Railway Company in 1897, the railway was
acquired by the Panhandle and Gulf Railway, and eventually changed its name to the Kansas
City, Mexico and Orient Railway Company of Texas. The company began building east from
Sweetwater in 1904 and connected south to San Angelo in 1909, totaling almost 400 miles of
track in Texas alone (Werner 2010).
The Pecos and Northern Texas Railway (P&NT), which was chartered in 1898, was acquired by
the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company in 1901. However, the Santa Fe used the
P&NT charter to begin building into the Panhandle and South Plains regions of Texas in the early
1900s (Anderson 2010). In 1914, the P&NT leased 486 miles to the Panhandle and Santa Fe
Railway (P&SF). These P&SF tracks run northwest from Sweetwater through Fisher and Scurry
counties and follow the Tonkawa–Sweetwater project corridor for several miles. The P&NT
merged with P&SF in 1948. Other railroads operating at that time included the Roscoe, Snyder,
and Pacific (RS&P) Railway, which operated west of the project area in Nolan and Scurry
counties, and the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway, which operated in the northern part of
Fisher County. The Orient had the most miles of track in Nolan County in 1949, followed by the
T&P, P&NT, and RS&P (University of Texas 1949).

Gypsum and Oil
The railroads did much to encourage settlement across the land in the early 1900s, but the
harvesting of the land’s resources—namely oil, gas, and gypsum—spurred most of the
development in the latter half of the century.
Gypsum, a mineral plentiful in the region surrounding Nolan and Fisher counties, has been used
for a variety of purposes since its discovery. Ancient Egyptians used the mineral to seal burial
vaults and paint their coffins, Romans used it as fire protection on their buildings, and others used
it to cast statues or monuments (Yeats and Shelton 1975:53). Because gypsum is found in many
forms and colors, its uses are varied. Today, the mineral is found in toothpaste, foot cream, and
other commercially available products. Most commonly, perhaps, the mineral is known as
“plaster of Paris” when heated to the correct temperature. It got this name because Paris, France,
is built on beds of white gypsum and the mineral has been used there to cast statues for many
years.
In Fisher and Nolan counties, the mineral has been an important resource for many years. Local
Indian tribes used the crystallized version of the mineral for trinkets and silverware, among other
things (Yeats and Shelton 1975:54). It was first used as a building material in the United States
in 1885 when it was combined with animal glue for plastering; it was considered superior to lime.
Its utility was recognized during World War I when military installations used lath and board
construction for many of their barracks, and it did not take long for the mineral to make its way
into the majority of building materials (Yeats and Shelton 1975:54).
In Nolan County, the Franco-Texan Land Company started the Lone Star Plaster Company in
1882. Advertisements run at that time claimed the company was “. . . prepared to fill orders for
plaster of Paris of best quality at reasonable rates” (Yeats and Shelton 1975:55). The factory
employed approximately 150 people at that time and enjoyed a profitable beginning. However,
tragedy struck in 1883 when a shooting at a saloon resulted in the death of both managers of the
plant; Lone Star survived only one more year after that event.
Despite the failure of one gypsum corporation, two more enjoyed success in the twentieth
century. The United States Gypsum Company (USG) began operation in Sweetwater in 1924,
and the Flintkote Company constructed a plant east of Sweetwater in 1957 (Figure 6). USG used
gypsite to make ElDorado Cement Plaster until 1969, quarrying a total of more than 1.5 million
tons of the material. Beginning in 1928, the company also mined rock gypsum to make sheetrock
for drywall construction. When the company’s underground mine was closed in 1947, more than
650,000 tons of rock gypsum and anhydrite had been mined (Yeats and Shelton 1975:56).
Aboveground quarries provided the needed minerals for future operations, and millions of tons of
gypsum rock have since been extracted. The company has provided a steady economic boost to
Nolan County, providing employment opportunities and local industry to the area. Likewise, the
Flintkote Company contributed much to the local economy when it opened in 1957. Flintkote
utilized all of the latest industry technologies and machinery to make wallboard products. Its $5
million plant was located along a Santa Fe Railroad track spur, allowing easy access and shipping
nationwide (Yeats and Shelton 1975:57). In 1949, the top three manufacturers in Nolan County
were United States Gypsum Company, Gulf Oil Corporation, and Sweetwater Cotton Oil
Company (University of Texas 1949). Most of the gypsum in Fisher County is mined and taken
to the National Gypsum Company plant in Rotan or to other plants in Nolan County.

The gypsum industry provided a steady income to the area during those years, but even greater
wealth was flowing deep underground. Oil was discovered in Scurry County in 1923, Fisher
County in 1928, and Nolan County in 1939. The money from leasing land to petroleum
companies helped some farmers survive the hard depression years, and the industry provided
many jobs to those in need. Oil production was minimal at first, but continued to grow with each
passing year. In 1948, approximately 3,300 barrels of crude oil were extracted from Nolan
County fields, but in 1956, that number surpassed 8 million barrels (McDaniel 2010). Production
leveled off in both Fisher and Nolan counties in subsequent years, equaling approximately 2
million barrels per year from the 1970s through the 1990s.

METHODOLOGY

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS IN VICINITY OF PROJECT AREA
Prior to initiation of fieldwork, a literature and archival review was undertaken to determine
previous cultural resources surveys and sites within a 1.6-km (1-mi) radius of the project corridor.
The THC Atlas was consulted. Based on available Atlas data, five previous surveys have been
carried out in the 1.6-km search radius (Table 2). PBS&J conducted a survey in 2001 for the
EPA and recorded six prehistoric sites. An LCRA survey in 2002 in conjunction with the Bitter
Creek substation and access road documented two prehistoric sites, and Antiquities Planning and
Consulting recorded one prehistoric site during a survey related to the Sweetwater Wind Farm in
2003. In 2006, Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc., undertook survey for Texas Department of
Transportation (TxDOT) and recorded one prehistoric site. Blanton and Associates surveyed a
part of Farm–Market (FM) 419 at Kildoogan Creek in 2006 for TxDOT/FHWA, recording two
prehistoric sites. Surveys were conducted for the EPA in 1979 and in 2000, and a survey was
undertaken for Texas Department of Highways and Public Transportation (TDHPT) in 1987, but
no further information is available for those investigations. Additionally, in the early 1930s, Foy
Steadman recorded numerous sites in the area, but little else is available other than the site forms
according to the Atlas.
The 23 sites within the search radius are predominantly prehistoric and most are lithic scatters
(see Table 2). The eligibility for 20 of the sites is unknown, one was judged potentially eligible,
and two were recommended not eligible for NRHP inclusion.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL METHODS

Probability Zones
As part of the routing study conducted by HDR in 2009, Geo-Marine was asked to conduct a
database review for archaeological sites, historic properties, and historic cemeteries that were
recorded within the transmission line study area (Dayton 2009). This early study area
encompassed an area of 34.11 mi (54.9 km) by 9.94 mi (16.0 km), covering approximately

* All data on this table taken from THC Atlas; most Atlas data are limited to that presented on the table.

186,600 ac (75,500 ha), and was large enough to provide a spatial understanding of the inventory
of recorded archaeological sites and aided in establishing archaeological probability zones or
areas that were used in the routing analysis. Since most of the previously recorded sites in the
study area are located in proximity to drainages, Geo-Marine decided to use a conservative 1-km
(0.6-mi) buffer (a zone with a total width of 2 km [1.2 mi]) around all stream channels. Mediumprobability landforms intersecting the 1-km buffer were upgraded to high probability, with the
24

high-probability rating extending beyond the buffer to reflect the landform continuity. Although
not all of the known sites were included within the initial 1-km buffer, the extension of the highprobability rating to landforms intersecting the buffer did allow the capture of almost all known
archaeological sites within high-probability zones (Dayton 2009:27).
Based on the results of that database study, high-, medium-, and low-probability zones or areas
were identified. Stable landforms adjacent to streams have the greatest potential for prehistoric
sites and areas near section-line roads have the highest probability for historic-age sites (Dayton
2009:30). Landforms with stable upland landforms were considered medium-probability zones
for prehistoric and historic-age sites; everything else was considered low probability.

Field Methods
The study conducted by Dayton (2009) was specific in the data gathering needed to establish a
probability model for this project. However, it did not exactly mirror Oncor’s Generic Research
Design for Archaeological Surveys of Oncor Electric Delivery Electric Transmission Line
Projects in Texas (PBS&J 2008), because that document was provided to Geo-Marine at the
initiation of this fieldwork in early 2010. Once the preferred line was identified and the survey
corridor established, Geo-Marine followed the survey strategies prescribed in Oncor’s Generic
Research Design for the Lower Plains area of Texas based on the model Geo-Marine had
established previously. These strategies consist of the following:
• High-probability area (HPAs) will be subjected to an intensive pedestrian survey. Survey
transects will be no more than 98 ft (30 m) apart and distances between shovel tests will not
exceed 98 ft (30 m). Thus, overall density of shovel tests within HPAs will not be less than
1 per 98 ft (30 m) of linear right-of-way. Identification of HPAs for historic sites will
depend on the results of archival and historic research specific to the right-of-way and will
be conducted prior to the commencement of fieldwork.
• Medium-probability areas (MPAs) will consist of upland prairie areas farther away from
natural water sources, and areas close to water sources with slopes of greater than 20
percent. These areas will be walked and examined to verify surface conditions. Survey
transects will be no more than 98 ft (30 m) apart, with shovel tests to be placed
judgmentally (i.e., in locations to be determined at the discretion of the project
archaeologist in the field), with no minimum distances between shovel tests. Thus, there is
no minimum overall density of shovel tests within MPAs in this region.
• Low-probability areas (LPAs) will be identified prior to the fieldwork based on contour
maps and aerial photographs. These will consist of areas with extensive natural ground
disturbance, such as mass wasting or sheet erosion, areas disturbed by modern
development, or areas with slopes of greater than 50 percent. The LPAs will be verified
and documented during the field survey, but will not be subjected to any further
archaeological examination (PBS&J 2008:15–16).
Since the corridor is 160 ft (48.7 m) wide, it was traversed by a crew of three along two transects,
positioned 15–20 m off the centerline, along which shovel testing occurred. The third person,
normally the Field Supervisor, moved back and forth across the full width of the corridor taking
photographs; taking global positioning system (GPS) readings on each shovel test, all sites
encountered, including features and/or structures and piece-plotted individual artifacts or isolates
identified; and acquiring a general understanding of the area within and outside the project
corridor.
25

For the purpose of recordation and using the individual parcel numbers as identified by Oncor,
Geo-Marine’s strategy was to subdivide each parcel into segments identified by appending
sequential letters to the parcel number, assigned running west to east along the corridor. These
subdivisions were made when a parcel included areas of differential probability, when a parcel
crossed a major road or other barrier, or for other reasons of convenience at the discretion of the
Field Supervisor. For example, parcel 3.1 was subdivided into three segments. The westernmost
3.1a was tested as an MPA by walkover and judgmental shovel testing, followed by 3.1b, which
was tested as an LPA by walkover only, followed by 3.1c, which returned to the MPA testing
strategy.
Geo-Marine applied the survey strategies prescribed by Oncor as listed above when surveying
each probability area. All areas were shovel-tested using two transects spaced 30 m (98 ft) apart,
each 15 m (49 ft) from the centerline of the right-of way. This provided even coverage across the
49-m (160-ft) corridor. Within HPAs, shovel tests were excavated along each transect at 30-m
(98-ft) intervals. Exceptions to this strategy were made when field conditions dictated, such as
when excessive slope, bedrock outcrops or exposed bedrock, or ground disturbance was
encountered. These areas are noted as “No Dig” on project maps. MPAs were tested at
judgmental intervals according to the discretion of the Field Supervisor in charge of the survey of
an individual tract. In general, where there existed no obviously preferable location to place
shovel tests (for example, on relatively flat agricultural land), the following standard was
employed to ensure that all MPAs were subjected to a certain level of subsurface testing. In areas
with significant surface visibility (greater than 50 percent), shovel tests were excavated at
intervals no greater than 500 m on each transect, with each transect offset by 250 m (thus, at least
one shovel test for every 250 m of linear corridor). In areas without significant surface visibility,
shovel tests were excavated at intervals no greater than 200 m on each transect, with each transect
offset by 100 m (thus, at least one shovel test for every 100 m of linear corridor). LPAs were
examined by pedestrian walkover only. The soils excavated from all shovel tests were processed
through 6.35-millimeter (mm; 0.25-in) hardware cloth screens.
When cultural materials were encountered on the surface, the immediate area was subjected to an
intensive pedestrian survey to determine the extent of the surface scatter. Additionally, at least
one shovel test was excavated within the surface scatter to determine if there was associated
subsurface deposition. This is the only occurrence in which Oncor’s Generic Research Design
was not followed to the letter. When cultural materials were encountered in a shovel test, further
delineation shovel tests were excavated to determine the extent of the subsurface deposition. In
general, shovel tests were placed in a cruciform pattern at 5-m (16-ft) intervals around the initial
positive unit, until two negative tests had been excavated in each direction within the limits of the
corridor. Limited numbers of selected diagnostic artifacts found on the surface and all subsurface
cultural materials from shovel tests were collected, when allowed by the landowner. In the event
that a large site was encountered, a 10-m to 20-m interval would be used to expedite the
determination of the site boundary. These strategies follow those prescribed by Oncor’s Generic
Research Design (PBS&J 2008:16).
Shovel tests consisted of hand-excavated units 30–40 cm (11.8–15.7 in) in diameter excavated in
10-cm (4-in) or 20-cm (7.9-in) levels (where soil conditions permitted), with the excavated soil
passed through a 0.64-cm (0.25-in) hardware mesh screen to recover artifacts. Shovel tests were
excavated systematically along the proposed project corridor and within sites to depths of 80 cm
below surface (cmbs; 32 inches below surface [inbs]) or until bedrock was encountered,
depending on which was met first. The location of each shovel test was recorded with a
26

submeter-accurate Trimble® GeoXT™ GPS unit. Each shovel test was backfilled upon
completion of the recording process. Areas of bedrock outcrops or completely disturbed by steep
slopes, roads, stock ponds, or other construction were systematically investigated and
documented, but not shovel-tested. Areas of exposed soil, either on the surface or in profile (e.g.,
cutbanks), were also examined for cultural materials as they were encountered during survey.

Site Designation
Geo-Marine defines an archaeological site on the basis of content and extent. When a shovel test
yields cultural material, additional shovel tests are excavated, in a cruciform pattern at 5-m
intervals around the initial test, where right-of-way limits and/or soil conditions permit, until two
sterile shovel tests are encountered. For surficial materials, a site is defined as five or more
cultural items of at least two different artifact materials or classes (e.g., prehistoric stone tool
manufacturing debris of different raw materials, or manufacturing debris in combination with
stone tools; or for historic sites, several different historic-era ceramic [or glass] types, or ceramics
in addition to glass) within a 20-m (65.6-ft) square. A site is then defined within the extent of
positive shovel tests and/or surface scatter.
Conversely, on this survey, individual artifacts, or small groups of similar, nondiagnostic artifacts
(for example, fewer than five flakes composed of the same material) not meeting the above site
definition criteria were recorded as isolated finds and not assigned a locus number or considered
for listing in the NRHP.

Recording Methodology
Larger assemblages of artifacts were assigned a locus number in the field to serve as a temporary
site number. Locus numbers were assigned by appending consecutive numbers to the segment
designation where the locus was found. For example, two loci found in segment 15.1a would
receive the locus numbers 15.1a-1 and 15.1a-2 according to the order in which they were found.
A State of Texas Archeological Site Form was completed for each locus identified. This form
recorded locational information, vegetation cover, contextual integrity, estimated temporal
period, and artifactual material noted for each site and was submitted to the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) for official trinomial assignment.
Shovel test designations along the survey corridor were tied to the parcel on which the shovel
tests were excavated. Survey shovel tests were designated as follows: shovel test on parcel, on
transect left or right with sequential unit number within the parcel (e.g., ST 103a R30); or by grid
location, usually only for delineation units on sites or for isolated finds (e.g., ST 45b-1 N1000
E1000; or ST 50a L3/10N).
The location, stratigraphy, and any cultural materials or features found within each shovel test or
as isolated finds along the corridor were recorded on Geo-Marine shovel test forms.
Additionally, the location of each shovel test and isolated find was recorded by a hand-held,
submeter Trimble® GeoXT™ GPS unit, along with the beginning and ending of each segment,
locus datum, site boundary, and other points of interest within the corridor. A complete
photographic record was kept to record not only identified cultural remains, but also the general
topography and condition of the area at the time of the survey, as well as the field techniques and
methodology employed. All photographs were in digital format and recorded on a daily log.
27

Monitoring
Monitoring, rather than backhoe trenching, as stipulated in Oncor’s Generic Research Design, is
undertaken when soils are deep and the potential for buried archaeological deposits is likely,
particularly in alluvial, colluvial, and aeolian settings (PBS&J 2008:16–21). Deep trenching by a
backhoe would normally be the mode of investigation conducted in these settings, but trenching
can destabilize the underlying sediments at tower locations and is therefore not recommended.
Geoarchaeological monitoring during the drilling phase of the tower construction would involve
the examination of the soil as it is removed from the auger holes by the Project Archaeologist
(with a background in soils development) or Geoarchaeologist in order to identify any cultural
remains that might be disturbed during the drilling. This becomes a snapshot of the deposit
below. If cultural material is encountered, drilling continues at a slower pace and in tighter
increments (60 to 100 cm) as documentation of the materials, soil matrix, and soil color are
recorded by the archaeologist. Small samples of the soil are screened through 0.25-inch hardware
cloth to determine the depth location and content of the artifact-bearing strata. Should significant
archaeological remains be encountered in any auger hole, work is suspended until consultation
with the Principal Investigator and the THC reviewer has occurred and a decision has been made
as to the research potential of the materials or deposit encountered and the likelihood of
additional damage to those materials or deposits. Only if the find is considered to suffer an
adverse effect is the process for additional examination and evaluation, and/or moving the tower
location considered. This process is carefully laid out in the Generic Research Design (PBS&J
2008:19–21) and may possibly end in the mitigation of the archaeological site (PBS&J 2008:22).
Though the Tonkawa to Sweetwater line does cross numerous creeks along its corridor, the
occurrence of deeply buried soils is nearly nonexistent. Most of these creeks have very narrow
floodplains, or are crossed near the headwaters, or are upland drainages. Bedrock occurs at or
very near the surface all along the corridor, and soils in these areas are not conducive to
containing deeply buried archaeology. Therefore, monitoring for deeply buried sites was not an
issue on this line.

NRHP Testing
On those sites that had been recommended for avoidance and/or monitoring in the survey phase
of this project, but would be impacted by the installation of transmission towers, a limited testing
strategy was suggested and agreed upon between Oncor and Geo-Marine. This strategy consisted
of utilizing 50-x-50-cm, 1-x-1-m, and/or larger units to expose more than just a “snapshot” of the
site in order to gain a better understanding of its true eligibility for listing on the NRHP. At least
one 1-x-2-m unit would be placed near or at the location of the tower, and no fewer than four
smaller units (50-x-50-cm in size) placed in the quadrants around the tower location. In addition,
other units would be placed in or over observed features that would likely be impacted by
vehicular traffic during the construction phase. The location, stratigraphy, and any cultural
materials found within each unit were recorded on standard Geo-Marine unit forms, and the
location recorded by a hand-held, submeter Trimble® GeoXT™ GPS unit. The units were
excavated in 10-cm levels to the base of and two levels beyond any artifact-bearing sediment. All
sediment extracted was screened through 0.25-inch hardware cloth, and artifacts retrieved were
analyzed in the field. In addition, a hand-drawn sketch map was also produced at each site. A
complete photographic record was kept to record not only identified cultural remains, but the
field techniques and methodology employed. All photographs were in digital format and
recorded on a daily log.
28

HISTORIC-AGE ARCHITECTURAL RESOURCES METHODS
The Architectural Historian documented historic-age standing architectural resources within a
total 1,000-ft buffer (305 m; 500 ft [152 m] on each side of the project centerline) of the project
corridor. The primary objective was to identify historic resources (buildings and structures at
least 50 years or age or older), evaluate historic resources for eligibility for inclusion in the
NRHP and for State Archeological Landmark (SAL) designation, and evaluate the potential for
visual impact of the proposed transmission line on any historic resources recommended eligible
for NRHP or SAL inclusion. Documentation included photography and field notes regarding
each structure’s condition, age, and potential visual impact. The 1936 and 1961 versions of the
General Highway Map of Fisher County and the 1940 and 1961 versions of the General Highway
Map of Nolan County (Texas State Highway Department 1936, 1940, 1961a, 1961b) were
examined to aid in the determination of whether the sites and structures identified during survey
were extant at the time of the generation of the maps. Additional archival research (e.g.,
deed/title) for identified historic-age resources and sites was undertaken to further evaluate the
eligibility of each structure. A single property (i.e., Resource 1) might have multiple historic-age
structures, and each individual structure was described separately as Structural Resource (SR) 1a,
SR 1b, etc.

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA

National Register of Historic Places
The assessment of significance of a cultural resources property is based on federal guidelines and
regulations. The criteria (36 CFR [Code of Federal Regulations] Part 60.4 [a–d]) for evaluating
properties for inclusion in the National Register are codified under the authority of the National
Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, and the Advisory Council on Historic
Preservation has set forth guidelines to use in determining site eligibility. Based Advisory
Council guidelines, any resource that is included in or eligible for inclusion in the National
Register is a “historic property.” Federal regulations state that “The term ‘eligible for inclusion in
the National Register’ includes both properties formally determined as such by the Secretary of
the Interior and all other properties that meet National Register listing criteria” (36 CFR §800.2
[e]). Subsequent to the identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions,
the following four criteria for eligibility are applied:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design,
setting, material, workmanship, feeling, and association and
(a) that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of
our history; or
(b) that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
(c) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant
and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
(d) that have yielded or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history [36 CFR
Part 60.4 (a–d)].

29

The principal research objective is to determine whether a cultural resources property possesses
the potential to contribute to one or more of the above-defined criteria. Therefore, adequate
information on site function, context, and chronological placement from both archaeological and,
if appropriate, historical perspectives is essential for cultural resources investigations. Because
research questions vary as a result of geography, temporal period, and project design,
determination of site context and chronological placement of cultural properties is a particularly
important objective during the inventory process. The objective of this current project was to
locate and define both horizontally and vertically any cultural resources, document and describe
those resources, and then, when adequate data were present, evaluate each for NRHP eligibility.

State Archeological Landmark
The THC is responsible for designating a resource as a State Archeological Landmark under
Antiquities Code of Texas criteria (THC 1997). At issue, however, is whether a site meeting
those criteria is significant and eligible for designation as an SAL or for inclusion in the National
Register. Listing in the National Register is a prerequisite for a building to be designated as an
SAL. Archaeological sites may be considered significant at the state level and be recognized or
designated as an SAL provided that at least one of the following conditions is met:
(1) The archeological site is situated on lands owned or controlled by the State of Texas or one of its
political subdivisions; or
(2) The archeological site is situated on private lands that have been specifically designated as an
SAL . . . and fits at least one of the following criteria:
(A) Preservation of materials must be sufficient to allow application of standard archeological
techniques to advantage;
(B) The majority of artifacts are in place so that a significant portion of the site’s original
characteristics can be defined through investigation;
(C) The site has the potential to contribute to cumulative culture history by the addition of new
information;
(D) The site offers evidence of unique or rare attributes; and/or
(E) The site offers a unique and rare opportunity to test techniques, theory, or methods or
preservation, thereby contributing to scientific knowledge [Texas Natural Resources Code
1977; Title 9, Chapter 191, Texas Antiquities Committee, Section 191.094 and Chapter
41.7, Antiquities Code of Texas].

SAL designation encourages preservation and ensures that a property is at least documented if it
cannot be preserved (THC 1997). An SAL designation for a site on privately owned land must
have the written consent of the landowner and is recorded in the county deed records; this
designation is conveyed with the property when sold:
(a) Any site located on private land which is determined by majority vote of the committee to be of
sufficient archeological, scientific, or historical significance to scientific study, interest, or public
representation of the aboriginal or historical past of Texas may be designated a state
archeological landmark by the committee.
(b) No site may be designated on private land without the written consent of the landowner or
landowners in recordable form sufficiently describing the site so that it may be located on the
ground.
(c) On designation, the consent of the landowner shall be recorded in the deed records of the county
in which the land is located [“Designating a Landmark on Private Land”; Title 9, Chapter 191,

ARTIFACT TREATMENT AND ANALYSIS
All artifacts recovered from shovel tests, as well as select artifacts from surface scatters, were
briefly examined, bagged, and labeled by provenience in the field. Upon arrival at the GeoMarine laboratory facilities in Plano, Texas, artifacts were inventoried, cleaned, analyzed, and
catalogued (Appendix A). Each artifact was thoroughly examined in order to identify and
determine, to the extent possible, its function or role and cultural or chronological affiliation
within the identified contexts.

Prehistoric Cultural Material
The prehistoric artifacts all fell within lithic artifact classes. Analysis detailed enough to
categorize items as biface, uniface, edge-modified flake, unmodified debitage,
ground/pecked/battered stone, and unworked stone was conducted at the laboratory at GeoMarine (see Appendix A). For each artifact, raw material was identified when possible, the size
based on US Geological Survey (USGS) size grades was taken, and the weight in grams (g) was
noted. All of these attributes were recorded and entered into an ACCESS database.

Finished Biface
Finished bifaces are those finely worked stone pieces in which the manufacturing process has
apparently been brought to completion, as evidenced by secondary retouch, edge straightening,
hafting preparation, notching, and similar characteristics. Eleven subcategories are recognized:
(1) Dart point; (2) Arrow point; (3) Indeterminate point; (4) Axe; (5) Thinned biface (knife); (6)
Chopper; (7) Drill; (8) Adze/Gouge; (9) Marginal biface retouch; (10) Indeterminate biface, and
(11) Gunflint. These tools are further divided into a number of subcategories: (1) Complete; (2)
Tip; (3) Midsection; (4) Base/stem; (5) Longitudinal fracture; (6) Tang; (7) Blade; (8)
Proximal/Medial;(9) Distal/Medial; and (10) Indeterminate fragment.

Unfinished Biface
Unfinished bifaces are those in which the manufacturing process has not been brought to
completion. These artifacts tend to be somewhat crude, lacking the fine workmanship of finished
tools. Five subcategories are recognized: (1) Aborted, Early; (2) Aborted, Late; (3) Arrow point
preform; (4) Dart point preform; and (5) Unidentified fragment. Unfinished bifaces are further
categorized as complete or fragment.

Uniface
Unifaces are tools that exhibit flake scars on one face only. Fifteen basic subtypes have been
identified: (1) Marginal modified/retouched uniface; (2) Borer; (3) Burin; (4) Denticulate; (5)
End scraper; (6) Side scraper; (7) Scraper with Graver spur; (8) Graver; (9) Notch; (10) Burin
spall; (11) Adze/Gouge; (12) Circular scraper; (13) Gossett uniface; (14) End/Side scraper; and
(15) Indeterminate. These categories are further distinguished by whether the specimen is
complete or fragmentary.
31

Edge-modified Flake
Edge-modified flakes exhibit discontinuous retouch or very abrupt retouch of an edge, often on
both faces, which, if caused by human activity and not acts of nature or by animals, likely reflects
modification through use, rather than intentional, formal modification. Edge-modified flakes
were classified as expedient tools (i.e., reflecting human modification) if exhibiting more than
one edge or an entire edge (as opposed to a very small area) with modification. The 11 categories
recognized are the same as for unmodified debitage.

Unmodified Debitage
Unmodified debitage is the unused debris resulting from lithic reduction processes; it usually
takes the form of flakes, which must exhibit a platform and a bulb of percussion, and
nondiagnostic shatter. Debitage may be further distinguished by the amount of cortex remaining
on the piece. A total of 11 subcategories is recognized: (1) Primary Decortication Flake, 75
percent cortex; (2) Secondary Decortication Flake, less than 75 percent cortex; (3) Tertiary Flake,
no cortex; (4) Biface thinning flake; (5) Angular shatter; (6) Platform-bearing remnant; (7) Thin
flake fragment; (8) Distal flake fragment; (9) Blade; (10) Blade fragment; and (11) Not
applicable.

Core
A core is a cobble or mass of lithic material exhibiting scars that result from the systematic
removal of flakes by human activity. Four subcategories of cores are recognized: (1) Tested
pebble/nodule; (2) Complete core; (3) Fragment/indeterminate; and (4) Exhausted core. Cores
are further subdivided into morphological and technological categories: (1) Bipolar; (2)
Discoidal; (3) Multidirectional; (4) Unidirectional; and (5) Not applicable.

Ground/Pecked/Battered Stone
The ground/pecked/battered stone artifact class includes those specimens that have been modified
by grinding, pecking, or battering or any combination of the three processes. Seventeen
subcategories, divided further into complete and fragmentary pieces, are recognized: (1)
Abrader; (2) Anvil; (3) Celt; (4) Hammerstone; (5) Incised Stone; (6) Mano; (7)
Mano/hammerstone; (8) Metate/grinding slab; (9) Pendant/gorget; (10) Polished Stone; (11)
Smoothed Stone; (12) Sinker (fishing weight); (13) Bead; (14) Multi-purpose; (15) Atlatl
weight/bannerstone; (16) Mano/metate; and (17) Stone hoe.

Unworked Stone
Unworked stone refers to materials at a site that, although not formally or directly utilized or
modified by humans, have nevertheless been affected by human activity. Three formal
subcategories are recognized: (1) Manuport cobble (i.e., not natural to site context, but brought
onsite); (2) Burned or Fire-cracked Rock (FCR); and (3) Ochre. An additional category, Not
Applicable, is included for those materials that do not fit into these categories.
32

Historic Cultural Material
The analysis of the historical material made use of four major analytical categories of artifacts
based on South (1977), consisting of four major functional categories—(1) Domestic (which
includes Furnishings), (2) Architectural, (3) Personal, and (4) Activities—and a minor category of
(5) Indeterminate when function cannot be established.
The four major artifact categories—Domestic/Furnishings, Architectural, Personal, Activities—are
divided into various subcategories. These subcategories are then subdivided into various classes,
types, and subtypes, depending on the type of subcategory and material type. In the case of
ceramics and glass, these subtypes are associated with manufacture or use dates whenever possible.
The final category above—Indeterminate—is reserved for unidentifiable metal, ceramic, and glass
fragments (e.g., pieces of thin metal, burned/melted glass globules, etc.) that are unclassifiable as to
category or function.

Domestic
The Domestic category includes artifacts related to food service (i.e., tableware and food storage,
including food preparation), metal, ceramics, and glass items associated with plates, serving pieces,
glass containers, cooking pots, etc. The Furnishings subcategory includes all nonfood service- or
nonfood storage-related household items such as furniture, stove, and lamp and table glass or
ceramic vase or figurine. An “Unidentified Domestic” subcategory subsumes the remainder of the
food-related items such as bone and shell. It should be noted that not all ceramics or glass artifacts
fall within the Domestic category; in some cases, artifacts of these materials belong within the
Architectural (e.g., window glass) or Activities (e.g., electrical insulators) categories.

Architectural
The Architectural category includes all items that could be related to buildings or structures, such as
window glass, nails, brick, mortar and/or plaster, and ceramic tile or pipe.

Personal
The Personal category includes items of individual use such as clothing, buttons, shoes, doll parts,
cosmetic bottles, snuff bottles (identified on the basis of characteristics such as glass color, bottle
shape, and lip shape), musical instruments, and smoking pipes.

Activities
The final functional category—Activities—includes all nonhousehold items such as those
associated with transportation and farm-related equipment. Activities category items include truck
or tractor parts, harness buckles, fence staples, fence wire, horseshoes or horseshoe nails, and
firearms/weapons parts and cartridges. As with Personal items, the Activities category often makes
up only a small proportion of the overall assemblage of identifiable historical artifacts from a site.

33

Faunal and Vegetal Material
Faunal bone and vegetal remains are categorized by class (animal bone, shell, or vegetal) and
analyzed for taphonomic characteristics and type (burned/unburned, worked/unworked, and
vegetal type [e.g., wood charcoal]). When possible, each specimen is identified to species level
or to at least bone type and animal/size (e.g., long bone fragment, medium-large mammal, etc.).
Any indications of calcination and/or human modification are noted and described.

CURATION
At the time of the survey, most of the corridor fell on private property. Because of this and at the
request of some landowners, many artifacts were returned to the landowner, and many others
discarded after analysis if not diagnostic, leaving only a limited number of artifacts, primarily
diagnostics, along with all field records, photographs, and laboratory analyses sheets to be curated
at TARL in Austin.

CHAPTER 5
RESULTS

The investigations of the transmission line corridor encompassed a total of 35.1 mi (56.5 km),
comprising approximately 673.5 ac (272.6 ha), beginning at the westernmost end, the Tonkawa
switching station, moving eastward along the route continuously, and ending 0.5 mi (0.9 km) east
of the line’s intersection with County Road (CR) 131 (see Figures C1–C15). The total line
surveyed includes one major reroute and a very short, minor reroute (totaling a combined
approximately 2.9 mi) surveyed southeast of Sweetwater, and data from all options are presented.
A total of 2,814 shovel tests was excavated along the line and to delineate sites: 2,527 in highprobability areas (approximately 426 ac or 69 percent of the line), 286 in medium-probability
areas (183.7 ac or 30 percent of the line), and one in a low-probability area (6.4 ac or 1 percent of
the line) where it intersected with a medium/low boundary.
During the course of the survey, 49 archaeological sites were identified: 34 prehistoric, eight
historic-age, and seven multicomponent sites. Deed/title research was conducted for all sites with
historic components, with the exception of sites considered to be the result of historic-era dump
episodes. Fifty-seven isolated finds were identified on the general corridor surface or from
isolated shovel tests not associated with a site.
Eight sites recorded along the original corridor were initially recommended for avoidance or
monitoring if avoidance was not possible because of the lack of permission for subsurface
investigations or because of the potential to contain significant cultural deposits. As shovel test
access to parcels was obtained and with the final route and tower location placements established,
seven of these sites were further investigated for their NRHP eligibility.
As part of the investigation of the proposed transmission route, an architectural survey identifying
and evaluating all standing structures in the corridor and within a 1,000-ft buffer of the project
corridor was also undertaken (Appendix B). Two of these 13 properties were associated with
archaeological sites found within the project corridor. The remaining properties with standing
structures were within the architectural buffer zone but beyond the project corridor (see Appendix
B).

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES

Fisher County Sites

Site 41FS93 (Locus 4a-1) and Architectural Resource 3

Archaeological Investigations
Site 41FS93 is a historic-age site found in a cotton field east of CR 459. It measures 120 m (394
ft) long and at least 49 m (161 ft) wide (5,880 m2; 63,290 ft2) inside the project right-of-way but
extends beyond the project corridor (Figure 7; Appendix C, Figure C2). Shovel tests revealed
clay and clay loam to depths of 60–80 cmbs, at which point CaCO3 was encountered. No
vegetation surrounds the site because of its location in a plowed, harvested cotton field near wind
turbines. The portion of the site within the project corridor appears to have poor contextual
integrity due to disturbances from extensive and continuous plowing.
A surface scatter containing brick, milk glass, electric wire insulators, ceramics, and red building
tile was observed, but none of these materials was collected. The materials are consistent with an
early to mid-twentieth-century house site. Four sterile shovel tests were excavated within the site
boundary (see Figure 7). No artifacts were collected from the site.

Architectural Evaluation—Resource 3
Two small buildings currently used to house farm equipment (Structural Resources [SRs] 3a and
3b) and a windmill (SR 3c) are located just north of the project corridor. The buildings were
likely associated with a house that has since been razed. SR 3a is a front-gabled, single-story
domestic dwelling constructed ca. 1930 (Figure 8). The structure appears to have been altered at
some point to accommodate farm equipment storage. Two single-entry doors are located on the
façade, with one-over-one paired windows in between. The north and south elevations contain
wood-framed garage entry doors. SR 3b is a single-story, front-gabled secondary structure built
ca. 1940 (Figure 9). It is constructed of red concrete blocks and contains a single-entry wood
door on the façade and wood paneling in the gable ends. The property also includes SR 3c, an
early twentieth-century Aermotor windmill (Baker 1985) (Figure 10).

Archival Investigations
A structure is shown just to the north of site 41FS93 on the 1961 edition of the General Highway
Map of Fisher County, Texas, but not on the earlier 1936 edition (Texas State Highway
Department 1936, 1961a). Since the scaling of the two historic maps is not geo-referenced
precisely to today’s aerials, its location is not exact, but it is very close.

Site 41FS93 is located on the south half of Section 19, Block Y, of the Texas and Pacific Railroad
surveys in Fisher County, Texas. According to the Texas General Land Office (GLO 2010a), a
patent for the property was issued in 1881 to the Texas and Pacific Railroad Company. Archival
research conducted at the Fisher County Clerk’s office revealed that between 1881 and 1912, the
property was divided into two sections: the southwest quarter and southeast quarter. However,
by 1936, the two sections were consolidated as the south half of Section 19. Site 41FS93 is
situated on what was the southwest quarter of Section 19, where deed title research was able to
trace the chain of ownership back to 1917. In 1917, E. H. McCaughan and wife Mary
McCaughan granted the property to L. W. Levertt, who between 1917 and 1925 entered into a
Deed of Trust with the Trent State Bank (Fisher County Clerk, Roby, Texas, [FCC] 1917:Deed
Book [DB] 61:208). Although the deed of trust was not found, it appears that L. W. Levertt
either defaulted or transferred the contract, since in December 1925, the Trent State Bank granted
the property to J. M. Spurlock and wife Lizzie Spurlock. In October 1936, the Trent State Bank
sold the property to J. L. Elrod with the condition that he pay the remaining balance owed by J.
M. and Lizzie Spurlock (FCC 1936:DB 105:98). J. L. Elrod consolidated the property by
purchasing both the southeast quarter and southwest quarter of Section 19, Block Y, in 1936
(FCC 1936:DB 100:363). In 1937, J. L. Elrod granted the complete south half of Section 19 to E.
I. Pinkard and wife Dollie Pinkard, who in 1947 granted the property to E. J. Kohutek and wife
Elise Kohutek (FCC 1937:DB 107:116; FCC 1941:DB 116:372). In 1988, E. J. and Elise
Kohutek granted the property to Carrol Feagan and wife Nancy Feagan, who in 2001 granted the
property to the current owner, Joe Feagan (FCC 1988:DB 631:57; FCC 2001:DB 749:795).

Summary and Recommendations
Site 41FS93 appears to be an early to mid-twentieth-century house site. Resource 3 is composed
of three standing structures—two buildings housing farm equipment (SRs 3a and 3b) and a
windmill (SR 3c)—located just north of the site within the 1,000-ft architectural buffer
surrounding the project corridor. Due to alterations to the individual standing structures and the
site as a whole, Resource 3 lacks integrity of design, setting, association, and feeling. SRs 3a–3c
lack sufficient historical and architectural importance for listing in the NHRP under Criteria A
through C. Archival investigations failed to reveal data pertinent to NRHP Criteria a–d (36 CFR
Part 60.4 [a-d]) or to SAL designation criteria (Title 9, Chapter 191).
In view of the poor archaeological contextual integrity from plowing activities and lack of
subsurface deposits, it appears that no significant cultural deposits exist within the project
corridor, and site 41FS93 is considered to have little or no remaining research potential within the
project corridor. Nevertheless, because the site appears to extend beyond the project corridor to
39

10. SR 3c at site 41FS93, looking northeast

the north and south, it cannot be fully evaluated for its NRHP potential and thus is recommended
of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as an SAL. If the entire site
were later determined eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, the portion within the project corridor
would not contribute to that determination. No further work is recommended for the portion of
site 41FS93 within the project corridor.
Site 41FS94 (Locus 4a-2)
Archaeological Investigations
Site 41FS94 is a historic-age site found in a cotton field immediately west of CR 457. The site
measures approximately 55-x-30 m (1,650 m2 [180-x-98 ft; 17,640 ft2]), oriented east–west, and is
contained within the current project corridor (Figure 11; see Figure C2). The onsite shovel test
showed loamy clay to clay soil to a depth of 60–65 cmbs, where CaCO3 was found. No
vegetation surrounds the site since it is situated in a plowed cotton field. ThThise site exhibits
disturbances because of continued plowing of the area.
40

An artifact scatter containing brick, milk glass, and historic ceramics was observed on the surface
of the cotton field. One shovel test was excavated within the site boundary to a depth of 65 cm;
(26 in) below surface (cmbs) but yielded no artifacts, and the four shovel tests closest to the site
along the transects also failed to yield cultural material. No cultural material was collected from
the site, which appears to be a nineteenth- to twentieth-century house site.

Archival Investigations
A structure is shown in proximity southeast of this site on the 1936 edition of the General
Highway Map of Fisher County, Texas but is not shown on the 1961 edition (Texas State
Highway Department 1936, 1961a). Scaling on the older maps is not always easily geo­
referenced with modern aerials, though the types and ages of the materials found could easily
represent the location on the historic map.
Site 41FS94 is located on the south half of Section 19, Block Y, of the Texas and Pacific Railroad
surveys in Fisher County, Texas. According to the Texas GLO, a patent to the property was
issued in 1881 to the Texas and Pacific Railroad Company (GLO 2010a). Archival research
conducted at the Fisher County Clerk’s office revealed that between 1881 and 1912, the property
was divided into two sections, the southwest quarter and southeast quarter; however, in 1936, the
two sections were consolidated as the south half of Section 19. Site 41FS94 is situated on what
was the southeast quarter of Section 19, where deed title research was able to trace the chain of
ownership back to 1912, at which time C. M. McCaughan and wife Ida McCaughan granted the
property to W. B. McCaughan and wife Lizzie McCaughan (FCC 1912:DB 36:577). In 1920, W.
B. and Lizzie McCaughan granted the property to O. E. Haddoc, who in 1930 granted the
property to J. D. Doughty and wife Ida Doughty (FCC 1920:DB 50:391; FCC 1930:DB 90:280).
In 1936, J. D. and Ida Doughty granted the property to Lloyd Doughty, who also in 1936 granted
the property to J. L. Elrod (FCC 1936:DB 100:358; FCC 1936:DB 100:363). J. L. Elrod
consolidated the property by purchasing both the southeast quarter and southwest quarter of
Section 19, Block Y, in 1936. In 1937, J. L. Elrod granted the complete south half of Section 19
to E. I. Pinkard and wife Dollie Pinkard, who in 1947 granted the property to E. J. Kohutek and
wife Elise Kohutek (FCC 1937:DB 107:116; FCC 1941:DB 116:372). In 1988, E.J. and Elise
Kohutek granted the property to Carrol Feagan and wife Nancy Feagan, who in 2001 granted the
property to the current owner, Joe Feagan (FCC 1988:DB 631:57; FCC 2001:DB 749:795).

Summary and Recommendations
Site 41FS94 is considered to have poor contextual integrity because of continued plowing as well
as the lack of subsurface artifacts and features. Archival investigations failed to reveal data
pertinent to NRHP Criteria a–d (36 CFR Part 60.4 [a-d]) or to SAL designation criteria (Title 9,
Chapter 191). Based on these considerations, the investigated site area is considered not eligible
for NRHP inclusion or for designation as an SAL, and no further archaeological investigations
are deemed necessary.

42

Site 41FS95 (Locus 5b-1)
Site 41FS95 is a historic-age site found along an upland ridge finger overlooking a small, firstorder tributary of Linn Creek. The site is approximately 8-x-6 m (48 m2 [26-x-20 ft; 517 ft2]) in
size and is oriented east–west, all entirely within the current project corridor (Figure 12; see
Figure C3). Vegetation in the site area consists of various cacti, cedar, and some wildflowers and
grasses. Onsite soil consisted of gravelly loam to approximately 80 cmbs.
The site was identified through a surface scatter containing engine parts, a chisel, ceramics, and
glass, all consistent with a late nineteenth- or early to mid-twentieth-century timeframe. Nine
shovel tests were excavated in this vicinity, with only two containing cultural materials. A total
of 13 artifacts was collected from site 41FS95. Five artifacts were recovered subsurface through
shovel testing: a wire mesh fragment consistent with masonry, two Domestic glass body sherds
(one amber/brown and one clear [post-1880; Kendrick 1971]), and two charcoal samples (Table
3). These artifacts were recovered between 0 and 30 cmbs. The remaining eight artifacts
collected from the surface of ST R24 include a window glass fragment, and Domestic items of
pure white whiteware (n=2, post-1890; Moir 1987) and glass fragments of ash tint basal and table
glass (n=2, post-1915; Lebo 1995), clear (n=1, post-1880; Kendrick 1971), and
manganese/solarized table glass (n=2, 1850s–1920; Lockhart 2006).
Based on the limited size, topographic location, and types of materials observed, this site is
interpreted as a historic dump. Given these factors, site 41FS95 appears to have little or no
research potential and is considered not eligible for NRHP inclusion or for designation as an
SAL. Therefore, no further work is recommended for this site.

Site 41FS96 (Locus 5d-1) and Architectural Resource 4

Archaeological Investigations
Site 41FS96 is a historic-age homestead found adjacent to a second-order tributary of Linn Creek.
The site measures approximately 120-x-40 m (4,800 m2 [394-x-131 ft; 51,614 ft2), oriented east–
west within the current right-of-way but extends beyond the project corridor (Figure 13; see
Figure C3). Vegetation in the site area consists of mesquite, cacti, and grasses. Onsite soils
consisted of silty or gravelly sandy clay loam to 80–100 cmbs.
The site was initially discovered because of the three extant structures (designated as Resource 4)
and several aboveground features. A total of 10 shovel tests was dug within and around the site
area, but none contained cultural materials, and no artifacts were collected from the site.

Architectural Evaluation—Resource 4
Three standing structures—a concrete dwelling (SR 4a), a concrete trough (SR 4b), and a stone
cistern (SR 4c)—as well as features composed of a stone foundation, a small fallen shed, and a
large collapsed structure were noted within the site area. In addition, a barbed wire fence and
posts were also observed. SR 4a, a one-story, side-gabled domestic dwelling constructed ca
1930, measures roughly 6-x-3 m (20-x-10 ft) in size and is oriented east–west. The concrete­

framed dwelling has wood windows and doorframes, with board-and-batten wood slats in the
gable ends. The interior of the building is framed in wood as well. It is unclear whether the
poured concrete exterior walls are original or were added to support an earlier structure in the
1930s or 1940s (Figure 14). The concrete structure (SR 4b) that may represent a trough or pump
box measuring 1.2-x-1.8 m (3.9-x-5.9 ft) was found west of the dwelling and southeast of the
cistern (Figure 15). The cistern (SR 4c), built of large stone blocks with wide mortar joints
(Figure 16), is an estimated 5 m (16.4 ft) in diameter and rises 1.3 m (4.3 ft) above the ground
surface.
The small fallen shed feature is north of the cistern in the northwest part of the site. The shed was
built of dimensional lumber, and the walls and roof were sheathed in corrugated metal sheets
(Figure 17). The large collapsed structure feature northwest of the cistern appears to have had
fieldstone walls covered with a concrete stucco surface (Figure 18); a gas stove was found just
outside the foundation. Large quantities of dimensional lumber and “FERRIS” brick fill the
interior. Interior vertical plank walls and electrical wiring are also visible. To the north outside
the project corridor is a stone foundation feature (Figure 19).

Archival Investigations
The site is not shown on either the 1936 or the 1961 editions of the General Highway Map of
Fisher County, Texas (Texas State Highway Department 1936, 1961a). Archival research for site
41FS96, which is located on section 17, block Y of the Texas and Pacific Railroad surveys in
Fisher County, Texas, was conducted at the Fisher County Clerk’s office. According to the Texas
GLO (2010b), a patent deed for the property was issued in 1881 to the Texas and Pacific Railroad
Company, an assignee of the Texas and Pacific Railroad Company. Between 1881 and 1917, the
land was granted to William Lanius and wife N. P. Lanius, and in 1923, N. P. Lanius, widow of
William Lanius, granted the property to Sam Gorman and W. F. Woodrum (FCC 1923:DB
65:40). Shortly after, in 1924, W. F. Woodrum granted his share of the property to Sam Gorman,
who also in 1924 granted the entire property to J. W. Young and wife Iona K. Young (FCC
1924:DB 65:323; FCC 1924:DB 65:354). J. W. and Iona Young maintained ownership of the
property until 1942, at which time they granted it to J. W. Young Jr. (FCC 1942:DB 126:182).
Finally in 2001, J. W. Young Jr. granted the property to current owner LFY partners LTD (FCC
2001:DB 752:647).

Summary and Recommendations
Site 41FS96 was likely occupied during the early to mid-twentieth century. The mix of fieldstone
and concrete structures and features is common, and the presence of an electrical meter and
circuit breaker box indicate that the site area was used during this period. The site is not shown
on either the 1936 or 1961 editions of the General Highway Map of Fisher County, Texas (Texas
State Highway Department 1936, 1961a), although the site was not along a public road and thus
may not have been noticed by the preparers of these maps. Two buildings shown in the site area
on the 1969 USGS 7.5' Bernecker quadrangle probably represent the concrete and fallen
structures observed during the current investigation. SRs 4a–4c lack sufficient historical and
architectural importance for listing in the NHRP under Criterion B, C, or D and the archival
research fails to support listing under Criteria A (36 CFR Part 60.4 [a-d]) or under SAL
designation criteria (Title 9, Chapter 191).
In view of the lack of subsurface deposits and no sufficient historical and architectural
importance, it appears that no significant cultural deposits exist within the project corridor, and
site 41FS96 and the structural resources are considered to have little or no remaining research
potential. Nevertheless, because the site appears to extend beyond the project corridor to the
north, it cannot be fully evaluated for its potential and thus is recommended of unknown
eligibility for NRHP inclusion or for SAL designation. If the entire site were later determined
eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, the portion within the project corridor would not contribute to
that determination. No further work is recommended for the portion of site 41FS96 within the
project corridor.

Site 41FS97 (Locus 7a-1)
Site 41FS97 consists of historic-age structural debris found along an upland slope overlooking an
intermittent tributary of Linn Creek. The site measures approximately 35-x-25 m (875 m2 [115­
x-82 ft; 9,430 ft2), contained within the project corridor (Figure 20; see Figure C3). Vegetation in
the site area consists of grasses, sparse yucca, and low tree cover. Shovel testing in the area
revealed sandy loam with small amounts of gravel to a depth of approximately 80 cmbs. The site
area has poor contextual integrity, with moderate to severe erosion observed.
The site consists of a linear pile of structural debris that was observed on the surface (Figure 21).
The debris is composed primarily of concrete, although one brick and a piece of wire were also
observed. The linear nature of the feature and broken condition of the remnants suggest that this
may represent a dump episode. Surface inspection around this feature found scattered concrete
blocks and the piece of wire. Shovel tests in the area surrounding the site proved sterile.
The site is not shown on either the 1936 or the 1961 editions of the General Highway Map of
Fisher County, Texas (Texas State Highway Department 1936, 1961a). Site 41FS97 is
considered to have little or no research potential based on the poor contextual integrity and lack
of associated subsurface deposits and is considered not eligible for NRHP inclusion or for SAL
designation. No further archaeological work is recommended for this site.

Site 41FS98 (Locus 8a-1)
Site 41FS98 is a prehistoric site of unknown age located immediately west of FM 608. The site
measures approximately 30-x-15 m (450 m2 [98-x-49 ft; 4,844 ft2]), is oriented northnortheast/south-southwest, and is contained within the project corridor (Figure 22; see Figure
C4). Vegetation in the site area consists of grasses, cacti, and mesquite. Shovel testing revealed
clay loam soils to approximately 40–60 cmbs.
A surface scatter of chert debitage was observed. Several different varieties of chert were noted
in the scatter. One shovel test was excavated within the surface scatter onsite, but that excavation
as well as all of the surrounding shovel tests proved sterile. Among the five Edwards chert lithic
artifacts collected from the surface (Table 4) are a possible burin (Field Specimen [FS] 1/1)
formed on a piece of thick, blocky shatter (Figure 23) and a small edge-modified biface thinning
flake with a possible spokeshave along a lateral edge of the dorsal face. Three unmodified flakes
or flake fragments were also collected.

Unfortunately, no diagnostic artifacts were observed at the site. Based on the small site size, lack
of diagnostic artifacts, and absence of subsurface deposits and features, site 41FS98 is considered
to have little research potential and is considered not eligible for NRHP inclusion or for
designation as an SAL. No further archaeological work is recommended at this site.

Site 41FS99 (Locus 8b-1)
Site 41FS99 is a prehistoric site of unknown age found along a sloping upland surface
overlooking Cottonwood Creek. The site, approximately 15-x-35 m (525 m2 [49-x-115 ft; 5,635
ft2]) in size, is contained within the project corridor (Figure 24; see Figure C4). Vegetation in the
site area consists of mesquite, cacti, and grasses, and shovel tests showed silty clay loam to
approximately 60–80 cmbs. An existing electrical transmission line is located a short distance
south of the site.
The site boundary is primarily based on the extent of the surface scatter of flakes, most of which
appear to be varieties of Edwards chert. One positive shovel test (ST 8 R11) was dug within the
site boundary and contained one flake of translucent chert in the upper 10 cm (Table 5). Eight
additional shovel tests were dug at 5-m intervals surrounding this unit, but were all sterile to
80 cmbs. No diagnostic artifacts were observed.

Site 41FS99 appears to have little research potential in view of the limited subsurface deposits
and lack of features or diagnostic artifacts. Therefore, the site is considered not eligible for
NRHP inclusion or for SAL designation. No further archaeological work is recommended for
this site.

Site 41FS100 (Locus 9a-1)
Site 41FS100 is a prehistoric site of unknown age found along the edge of the uplands
overlooking Cottonwood Creek. The site is approximately 25-x-10 m (250 m2 [82-x-33 ft; 2,691
ft2]) in size and oriented east–west, entirely within the project corridor (Figure 25; see Figure C4).
Mesquite, cacti, and grasses comprise the area vegetation, and soils consist of gravelly sandy
loam to approximately 80 cmbs. A two-track road crosses the eastern edge of the site.
The site was identified through a surface scatter of chert flakes. Two onsite shovel tests and those
around the site boundary, all excavated to 80 cmbs, all proved sterile. Several varieties of
Edwards chert were noted among the surface scatter. No artifacts were collected.
The site is considered to have little or no research potential based on the small size, lack of any
diagnostic artifacts, and the lack of any associated subsurface deposits or features. This site is
considered not eligible for NRHP inclusion or for SAL designation. No further archaeological
work is recommended for site 41FS100.

Site 41FS101 (Locus 9a-2)
Site 41FS101 is a prehistoric site found on a bluff overlooking Cottonwood Creek. The site area
within the project right-of-way measures 60-x-50 m (3,000 m2 [197-x-164 ft; 32,308 ft2]), is
oriented north–south, and extends outside the current survey corridor (Figure 26; see Figure C4).
Mesquite, cacti, and grasses comprise the vegetation noted in the site vicinity. The portion of the
site within the survey corridor has 80 percent ground surface visibility and areas of exposed
bedrock; shovel testing revealed gravelly silty loam and no evidence of subsurface cultural
deposits or features.
The site was identified through the presence of an extensive surface scatter of lithic artifacts. One
shovel test in the middle of the scatter was excavated to 50 cmbs, at which point bedrock was
encountered, and contained no cultural material. The scatter was primarily composed of varieties
of Edwards chert and a few Ogallala quartzite flakes. Four lithic artifacts were collected from the
56

site surface (Table 6). The base and partial blade of an Edwards chert drill (FS 2/1), with an
estimated half of the blade length extant, has a thick, chunky base exhibiting minimal work on the
ventral surface and minor flaking on the dorsal surface to form the tool (Figure 27). A roughly
triangular-shaped cobble of quartzite likely used as a mano/hammerstone (FS 3/1) has a small
battered area at one “corner” end, a potlidded and cracked area on another “corner,” and the
opposite face potlidded and smoothed, with the smoothing continuing along/across the edge and
onto the opposite face (Figure 28). Two flakes—a translucent chert tertiary and a quartzite
secondary—were also collected.

The portion of site 41FS101 within the project corridor appears to have no significant cultural
deposits or diagnostic cultural material and is considered to have little or no remaining research
potential. Although the site area within the project corridor has poor contextual integrity and
areas of exposed bedrock with no evidence of subsurface deposits or features, the site extends
outside the current corridor and could contain areas with better integrity or features. Therefore,
because the site appears to extend beyond the project corridor to the north and south and cannot

be fully evaluated for its potential, site 41FS101 thus is recommended of unknown eligibility for
inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as an SAL. If the entire site were later determined
eligible for NRHP inclusion, the portion within the project corridor would not contribute to that
determination. No further work is recommended for the portion of site 41FS101 within the
project corridor.

Site 41FS102 (Locus 13a-1)—Reroute

Original Oncor Corridor Survey

Archaeological Investigations
Site 4FS102 is a multicomponent site found on an upland edge overlooking a first-order tributary
of East Cottonwood Creek. Within the survey corridor, the site measures approximately 30-x-35
m (1,050 m2 [98-x-115 ft; 11,300 ft2]) and is oriented east–west (Figure 29; see Figure C6);
however, the site likely extends beyond the southern edge of the project corridor. Grasses with a
few scattered cacti and scrub trees comprise the vegetation in the site area. Sandy loam in shovel
tests extended to a maximum depth of roughly 45 cmbs, where bedrock was found. Barbed-wire
fences form the east and west boundaries of the site, and the north boundary is about 20 m (66 ft)
south of the railroad track. A two-track road parallels the railroad. The site appears to have a
60

moderate amount of disturbance due to erosion, construction of the barbed-wire fences and the
railroad, and the existence of the two-track road. Given the proximity of sites 41FS102 and
41FS103, the two historic components may be related, but a sterile gap exists between them.
The site was identified through the presence of a surface artifact scatter. All of the shovel tests
excavated in and near the site area were sterile. A selective surface collection of one prehistoric
and nine historic artifacts was made at site 41FS102. The prehistoric component consists of a
variety of chert flakes and blades, as well as a few exhausted cores. The prehistoric scatter
appears densest in the western portion of the site, but materials were found throughout the site
area. The single prehistoric artifact collected (Table 7) is an Edwards chert scraper with a graver
spur. A lateral edge and the distal end of a roughly rectangular flake were modified by small
flake removals to form a graver at adjoining scraper edges. This was likely an expedient tool, not
exhibiting great care in its production.

Historic artifacts observed onsite consisted of manganese/solarized and aqua-tinted glass
fragments, metal and shell buttons, a suspender clip, plain white porcelain fragments, metal can
fragments, and machine parts. The glass and porcelain were found near the center of the site, but
the metal can fragments were more common near the periphery. The shell button fragment and
suspender clip were from the north end of the site. These materials are all consistent with a late
nineteenth- or early to mid-twentieth-century occupation.
The collected historic assemblage (Table 8) is composed of two Domestic manganese/solarized
bottle necks (1870s–1920; Lockhart 2006), as well as several Personal items: a shell button
fragment with one hole; the belt or suspender clasp embossed with floral decoration in two places
and two zeros; a 4-hole metal button; and four metal stud buttons. Two of the metal buttons are
labeled “KANTRIP BRAND,” another is labeled “CONES BOSS” with a railroad lantern, and
the last is labeled “SWEET-ORR & CO.” The Sweet-Orr & Co. manufactured work clothing
during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and was originally based in Wappinger Falls, New
York (Larson 1984:3). These stud-type buttons were most popularly used from the 1890s into the
mid-1900s on uniforms and work clothes of all kinds.

Archival Investigations
The site is not shown on either the 1936 or the 1961 editions of the General Highway Map of
Fisher County, Texas (Texas State Highway Department 1936, 1961a). Archival investigations
revealed that site 41FS102 is located on Section 5, Block 22, of the Texas and Pacific surveys in
Fisher County, Texas. According to Texas GLO (2010c) records, a patent to the property was

issued in 1876 to the Fidelity Insurance, Trust, and Safe Deposit Company, an assignee of the
Texas and Pacific Railroad Company. Archival research conducted at the Fisher County Clerk’s
office traced the property’s chain of ownership back to 1909. Between 1876 and 1909, the
property was granted to William Lagow and wife L. I. Lagow, who in 1909 granted
approximately 26 acres of Section 5 to the Pecos and Northern Texas Railway Company for the
construction of a railroad (FCC 1909:DB 33:26). Deed records showing the transfer of
ownership from William and L. I. Lagow were not found; however, it is known through a gas and
oil release that in 1939 the property was owned by W. W. Shields (FCC 1939:DB 119:108). W.
W. Shields maintained ownership of the property until his death in 1980, at which time ownership
of the property was transferred to his heirs Nancy K. Shields and John T. Shields (FCC 1980:DB
454:226). In 1992, Nancy K. Shields granted her interest in the property to John T. Shields, who
then in 2009 re-granted the property to Nancy Shields, the current owner (FCC 1992:DB
798:535; FCC 2009:DB 810:535).

Reroute Corridor Investigations
The final placement of the corridor overlapped the original corridor, moving the project boundary
approximately 20 m to the southwest. In December 2010, a visual inspection of the small reroute
area adjacent to site 41FS102 was undertaken. No additional cultural resources were identified
within the new area and thus the site is now considered to be entirely within the project area.

Summary and Recommendations
The manganese/solarized glass fragments and stud buttons indicate that the historic component
began in the late nineteenth or early twentieth century. The button and the suspender clip may
indicate that some kind of strenuous activity occurred here, possibly a work camp associated with
the railroad. This supposition is supported by the machine parts noted on the surface. The theory
that the site represents an ephemeral use of the area, together with the lack of any associated
subsurface deposits, seems to give the historic component little or no research potential. Archival
investigations failed to reveal data pertinent to NRHP Criteria a–d (36 CFR Part 60.4 [a-d]) or to
SAL designation criteria (Title 9, Chapter 191). The prehistoric component is thought to be a
lithic reduction area, but also retains little research potential since no diagnostics or features were
encountered. Because of the reroute corridor extended the project area to the southwest, site
41FS102 is now considered to be entirely within the current project area, and both components
are recommended as not eligible for NRHP inclusion or for SAL designation. Therefore, no
additional work is required at site 41FS102.
63

Site 41FS103 (Locus 13b-1)—Reroute

Original Oncor Corridor Survey

Archaeological Investigations
Site 41FS103 is a historic-age artifact scatter on the edge of an upland surface overlooking a firstorder tributary of East Cottonwood Creek. Site 41FS102 is about 80 m (262.5 ft) west, raising
the possibility that the two historic components are related (see Figure 28; see Figure C6). The
site measures roughly 50-x-40 m (2,000 m2 [164-x-131 ft; 21,530 ft2]) in size and is oriented
east–west, contained within the current corridor. Vegetation on the site area consists of open
grassland with scrub trees, and the soil is a silty clay, encountering bedrock at approximately 53
cmbs. The site has suffered from a moderate amount of erosion. The railroad is 15 to 20 m (49–
66 ft) northeast of the site, and a railroad switch is about 15 to 20 m northeast of the site. A line
of old fence posts runs diagonally through the western part of the site. Ten posts were found
within the project corridor at 1–1.5-m (3.3–5-ft) intervals.
The site was identified by the presence of a surface scatter containing plain white porcelain
sherds, manganese/solarized pressed glass fragments (1850s–1920; Lockhart 2006), clear glass
fragments (post-1880; Kendrick 1971), one milk glass vessel fragment, metal can fragments,
indeterminate metal, and a metal drum, all consistent with a late nineteenth- or early to mid­
twentieth-century occupation. The porcelain and manganese/solarized glass fragments were
predominantly found about 5 m (16 ft) east of the old fence line, but the other glass fragments
were found across the site. The main artifact concentration was located on a slight rise. The
metal can fragments were most often observed near the periphery of the site, with larger
fragments and whole cans primarily found at the east end. The single shovel test was excavated
in the densest part of the surface scatter, but no subsurface materials were encountered. Two
pieces of manganese/solarized glass were collected: a table glass fragment of pressed glass with
a faceted, geometric design (1850s–1920; Lockhart 2006), and a bottle base with no observed
manufacturing marks, but probably a crown oval style base (1870s–1920; Lockhart 2006) (Table
9).

Archival Investigations
The site is not shown on either the 1936 or 1961 editions of the General Highway Map of Fisher
County, Texas (Texas State Highway Department 1936, 1961a). Archival investigations revealed
that site 41FS103 is located on Section 5, Block 22, of the Texas and Pacific surveys in Fisher

Reroute Corridor Investigations
The final placement of the corridor overlapped the original corridor, moving the project boundary
approximately 20 m to the southwest. In December 2010, a visual inspection of the small reroute
area adjacent to site 41FS103 was undertaken. No additional cultural resources were identified
within the new area, and thus the site area remains unchanged and entirely within the project area.

Summary and Recommendations
No evidence of any permanent structure was noted at site 41FS103, suggesting that it may
represent some kind of temporary camp, possibly related to the cattle or railroad industries.
However, the presence of manganese/solarized pressed glass seems unusual for a temporary camp
and dates the occupation to the late nineteenth or early twentieth century. The site, which is now
entirely within the project area because of the reroute corridor extending the project area, seems
to have fair contextual integrity based on the moderate erosion noted. Nonetheless, the lack of
any associated subsurface deposits or features (excluding the fence line) appears to give site
41FS103 little or no research potential. Archival investigations failed to reveal data pertinent to
NRHP Criteria a–d (36 CFR Part 60.4 [a-d]) or to SAL designation criteria (Title 9, Chapter 191),
and therefore site 41FS103 is considered not eligible for NRHP inclusion or for designation as an
SAL. Consequently, no further work is recommended for this site.

Site 41FS104 (Locus 14.1-1)—Reroute and Tested

Original Oncor Corridor Survey

Archaeological Investigations
Site 41FS104 is a historic-age occupation found in the northwest corner of the intersection of CR
438 and a railroad track. The site occupies an area of 10-x-5 m (50 m2 [33-x-16 ft; 538 ft2])
inside the project right-of-way but extends beyond the project corridor to the southwest (Figure
30; see Figure C6). Vegetation in the site area includes cacti, mesquite, and grasses. Clay loam
revealed in the shovel tests extended to 80 cmbs. The site appears to have good contextual
integrity and no obvious signs of disturbance.
The site was initially discovered through a surface artifact scatter and the presence of
aboveground features. Material observed at the site included manganese/glass (1870s–1920;
Lockhart 2006), clear glass (post-1880; Kendrick 1971), aqua glass, metal, brick, and concrete.
Structural features were noted outside and to the southwest of the survey corridor. Sites 41FS104
and 41FS105 are separated by an approximately 80-m (263 ft) sterile gap and were originally
thought to potentially be associated.
Seven shovel tests were excavated in the site vicinity, but only two contained historic materials.
Twenty-two historic artifacts were collected at site 41FS104 (Table 10). Two artifacts collected
from shovel testing consist of a square iron nut and a large wire loop, both found between 0 and
50 cmbs. The remaining artifacts were selectively collected from the surface scatter. They
consist of two double-sided, graphite, 78-rpm record fragments (1915–1955; Lebo 1995); five
pieces of window glass; and Domestic items of a piece of Bristol interior/exterior stoneware
(post-1900; Greer 1981; Lebo 1992) and a whiteware fragment (post-1890; Moir 1987), as well
as vessel glass fragments of amber/brown (n=5), ash tint (n=2, post-1915; Lebo 1995), clear (n=2,
post-1880; Kenrick 1971), and manganese/solarized (n=2, 1870s–1920; Lockhart 2006).

Archival Investigations
The structural features beyond the survey corridor include a well, a possible chimney, concrete
steps, and a concrete cistern (Figure 31). The closest structure noted on either the 1936 or 1961
editions of the General Highway Map of Fisher County, Texas (Texas State Highway
Department1936, 1961a) is a school situated to the north across the railroad track from this site.
There is also a structure in proximity to the site to the west noted on the 1936 edition—but not on
the 1961 edition—however, it is farther away than the school. Unfortunately, the disparity of
structure locations between the two maps does not help in determining if the remains outside of
the current survey are associated with the school or some other structure not shown on historic
maps.

Figure 31. Features at site 41FS104, looking south.

Site 41FS104 is located on the southeast quarter of Section 4, Block 22, of the Texas and Pacific
Railroad surveys in Fisher County, Texas. According to the Texas GLO (2010d), the property
was patented in 1909 to J. B. Starr. Archival research conducted at the Fisher County Clerk’s
office traced the property’s chain of ownership back to 1926. Between 1909 and 1926, the land
was granted to Fred Roberts and wife M. E. Roberts, who in 1938 granted the property to Joe B.
Taylor and wife Edna Taylor (FCC 1926:DB 75:329; FCC 1938:DB 107:419). In 1941, Joe and
Edna Taylor granted the property to Hudson Taylor and wife Flora Taylor, who maintained
ownership of the property until 1970, at which time they sold it to the current owner, Joe C.
Duncan, Jr. (FCC 1941:DB 116:272; FCC 1970:DB 349:427).

Summary
Site 41FS104 appears to have good contextual integrity and contains subsurface deposits. It
represents an occupation beginning in the late nineteenth or early twentieth century. Because of
these factors, the site probably retains good research potential. However, based on the
distribution of the features, the main locus of the site is outside and to the south of the project
corridor and may yield better information. Therefore, because the site appears to extend beyond
the project corridor, it cannot be fully evaluated for its potential and thus is recommended of
unknown NRHP eligibility or SAL designation. If the entire site were later determined eligible
for inclusion in the NRHP, the portion within the project corridor would not contribute to that
determination. No further work is recommended for the portion of site 41FS104 within the
project corridor.

Reroute Corridor Investigations and Damage Assessment
Several months after the original survey, the corridor route was shifted approximately 30 m
southwest of the original survey route, and a final determination for the tower location at this site
area was established. The major portion of site 41FS104 was initially identified south of the
former route, well beyond the project corridor (see Figure 30). The corridor reroute shift to the
south placed more of the site area within the reroute corridor. With the positioning of a
transmission tower adjacent to the site location, the potential for impact became greater, and
therefore testing investigations were planned at site 41FS104.
Upon arriving at the site on December 16, 2010, to conduct testing, it was found that the tower
construction in this area had already been completed, with the transmission tower already
standing and the entire property clear-cut, scraped, and leveled (Figure 32).
A surface survey and impact evaluation was conducted over the site, resulting in the assessment
that the site had been significantly affected by construction activities. The impact evaluation or
damage assessment proceeded by first mapping the historic features and foundations at the site
and documenting the extent of the disturbances that had occurred. Site size within the combined
rights-of-way was set at 42-x-42 m (1,764 m2 [138-x-138-ft; 19,044 ft2]), but the southern site
boundary extended an additional 30 m (98 ft) beyond the reroute corridor to CR 438,
encompassing the foundation and features, for an estimated total site size of 72-x-42-m (3,024 m2
[236-x-138 ft or 32,568 ft2]).
The site consists of numerous lines of concrete-and-brick foundation footers with other associated
features for a former building, as well as a depression that was likely once a storm cellar. These
footers and associated feature structures were located both inside and outside the project reroute
corridor (Figure 33). Within the reroute corridor, a brick-and-concrete-lined cistern is located
immediately adjacent to the northeastern corner of the line of concrete footers. This cistern is
most similar to the bell-shaped cisterns commonly found in rural Texas farmsteads. Its mouth is
rather narrow, similar to a well, but quickly opens into a bell shape just below ground surface.
The reservoir below the ground appears to be approximately the typical 12–14-ft diameter as
described in Denton (2011:6–7). Just several feet north of the cistern is a large concrete cistern
cap. Unfortunately, at least one of the concrete foundation footers had been previously broken by
heavy machinery that apparently drove directly through the site.

west.

Two square, brick, water collector features, or filter boxes, were found near the exterior northern
corners of the building within the corridor; both features are hollow and have hardware cloth in
the interior (Figure 34). The location of these features, clearly on the outside edge of the
structure, and the presence of a drainage pipe or intake line within at least one of them, suggests
that they may have served to drain water from the building to the adjacent cistern. Two brick­
and-concrete pillars just south of the northern corners within the line of the foundation footers
may have served as some sort of construction bases. A third brick feature—a chimney base—was
identified in the interior of the southern portion of the building outside of the corridor. A set of
stairs and a stair base were approximately 3 m south of the northern portion of the building and
beyond the reroute corridor.
Two other feature areas were noted north of the foundations. The westernmost of these areas
appears to be a scatter of coal and coal ash, and the other appears to be a scatter of light ash and
window glass fragments. These areas had been extensively disturbed by the construction
activities (Figure 35). At the time of testing, construction disturbance was noted to a depth of 20–
30 cmbs. The majority of artifacts were identified within this depth range.
NRHP Testing
Three shovel tests (STs D1–D3; Table 11) and six 50-x-50-cm test units were placed in various
areas of the site within the reroute corridor; all units yielded cultural materials. In addition to
subsurface material, three artifacts were collected from the general site surface: a porcelain
fragment, probably a foot to a vase; a whiteware basal sherd with a footring (post-1920); and a
clear table glass fragment, probably from a bowl (post-1880).

Two test units (TUs 1 and 6) (Table 12) were placed in the interior of the northernmost building
within the corridor. In this area, only minimal disturbance was noted on the surface. The artifact
density was largely concentrated within the upper 10 cm of the units and dramatically dropped off
below this zone. The contents consisted of one fragment of whiteware, numerous fragments of
window glass and bottle glass, unidentifiable ferrous metal, and coal, as well as one tertiary chert
flake. In terms of artifact density, the majority of the site appeared to have only a light
concentration of artifacts across the surface. Given the absence of building materials, it appears
that the structures were intentionally torn down in the past and the majority of the debris removed
from the site area. However, at least four different brick-makers (Abilene [1930s], Ferris [post­
1924], Whiteselle [post-1892], and Millsap [1891–1920]) (Steinbomer 1982) were identified on
the site. This suggests several options: portions of the buildings may have been constructed at
different times, or the buildings were constructed from different sources of materials, or
subsequent additions and repairs were made from materials at hand, or any combination of these
scenarios.

Two 50-x-50-cm test units (TUs 2 and 3) were placed in the ash/artifact scatters north of the
building foundations. TU 2 was located in the center of the coal scatter and TU 3 was in the
middle of the ashy area. In both units, considerable disturbance from construction activities was
noted to at least 20 cm below the surface. A calcined unidentifiable mammal shaft fragment was
retrieved from 0–10 cmbs in TU 3; this small fragment (0.2 g) showed no indication of being
worked. Extensive deposits of bentonite coal, coal ash, and clinker were noted in both units (only
a representative sample of these materials was collected) (Table 13). Additionally, numerous
fragments of window and bottle glass were also recovered from the two units. The historic
artifact deposits appeared to be concentrated in the upper 40 cm, but minor amounts of coal
materials were identified to at least 70 cm in TU 3.

Additionally, two adjacent 50-x-50-cm units (TUs 4 and 5) were excavated on the north slope of
the circular depression near the western edge of the site. These two units were placed to examine
the construction of the depression. No stone lining or wood or other construction materials were
identified in the excavations. It appears that this is simply a dugout depression, likely used as a
storm cellar. As expected on the high slope, only a very light density of artifacts was observed in
the test units (Table 14).
Given the substantial structural remains and footprint of the structure, more consideration was
given to the possibility that site 41FS104 was indeed the site of the Gannon School. The property
landowner happened to stop by during testing and indicated that he had been a student at the
school and remembered this as its location. It was then recommended that additional archival
research and possibly oral interviews be conducted, and the development of a historic context for
the community of Gannon and its early school be produced to mitigate the detrimental effects of
clearing the transmission corridor through approximately 50 percent of the site.

Gannon School Mitigation
Site 41FS104 was discovered during an archeological survey conducted by Geo-Marine, Inc., in
May 2010. The site is located on the southeast quarter of Section 4, Block 22, of the Texas and
Pacific Railroad surveys in Fisher County, Texas. Historic-age materials found at the site include
glass, metal, brick, concrete, and structural features. The structural features were thought to be
associated with the Gannon School, which appears on the 1940 and 1961 Fisher County General
Highway maps. As a result of the findings, it was recommended that the site be avoided by
construction activities.
In December 2010, Geo-Marine archeologists revisited site 41FS104 to conduct additional testing
due to the rerouting of the transmission corridor route. At the time of the revisit, it was apparent
that the tower construction of this area was complete, and as a result, site 41FS104 was
significantly impacted. Thus, it was recommended that additional archival research focusing on
the community of Gannon and the Gannon School be conducted to mitigate the impacted site.
The additional archival research was completed in April 2011 by a Geo-Marine architectural
historian who meets the Secretary of the Interior’s professional qualification standards. Inquiries
regarding the community of Gannon and the Gannon School were made at the Heritage House
Senior Living Community, which resulted in an oral interview with Ardell Floyd, a former
Sunday school teacher at the Gannon School ca. 1950 after the building no longer functioned as a
school. Contextual information regarding the physical, cultural, and historic condition of the
school was gathered through review of historic maps, aerials, teacher directories, and secondary
literary resources gathered from the Fisher County Pioneer Museum, Rotan Public Library,
Sweetwater Public Library, Abilene Public Library, and Hardin-Simmons University Research
Center for the Southwest. In addition, information was gathered from deed title research
conducted at the Fisher County Clerk’s Office and an on-line newspaper database
(NewspaperARCHIVE.com 2011).

Gannon, Texas, History
The community of Gannon, Texas, is located in southwest Fisher County. The county was
formed from Bexar County in 1876 and officially organized 10 years later in 1886. In that same
year, the County Commissioners Court created two school districts; the dividing line ran north to
south. Between 1880 and 1890, the county’s population grew from 135 to 2,996. The rapid
population increase spurred the development of schools, and by 1890, 32 schools were in Fisher
County (Blount 1947:106). The rapid development of multiple schools prompted county officials
to divide the existing school districts into four districts, one for each quarter section of the county.
School District No. 4 was designated for the southwest quarter, where the Gannon School (site
41FS104) was located (Yeats and Shelton 1971:88).
Early settlers, primarily cattle ranchers, were attracted to Fisher County because of its abundant
grazing land and available water. By the early 1890s, settlers had moved into the Gannon area
and established cattle ranches (Yeats and Shelton 1971:9). Due to the lack of existing
documentation, it is unknown when the community of Gannon was officially established;
however, it is known that in 1896 the Nunn family settled in the area. Joe Nunn, a cattle rancher,
leased two sections of Texas Public School Land north of the Nolan County line for 3 cents an
acre. By 1898, he had purchased the land and lived in a half dugout with his wife Fannie Nunn
and their seven children. Later that year, Reg Lagow, Joe Nunn’s brother’s father-in-law,
purchased land adjoining the Nunn ranch and moved his family to the area in 1899 (Fisher
County Historical Commission 1986:241).
Prior to the settlement of the Nunn and Lagow families, the area had already established a school,
which was located on the south corner of what became the Nunn ranch (approximately 1.5 miles
east of site 41FS104). The school was known as the Grover School and had been in operation
since ca. 1891. In 1901, Gannon School District No. 16 was created out of School District No. 4,
and the Grover School was renamed Gannon School in honor of C. L. Gannon, a school board
trustee (Catalina 2011; FCC, Commissioners Court Minutes [CCM] vol. 2:199).
The Gannon School continued to operate in the original Grover School building until 1915, at
which time J. L. Preston and wife Cleo Preston granted 4.9 acres of land from the southwest
corner of the east half of Survey No. 4, Block No. 22, of the Texas and Pacific Railroad Company
lands to the Gannon Common School District No. 16. The property on which the school was
located is adjacent to the Santa Fe Railway line (constructed in 1912) and sold for $20. M. A.
Hopson, Fisher County judge, paid the amount and secured the transfer of land in a Quitclaim
deed (FCC 1915:DB42:619). From this point forward, the deeds for the surrounding property
reference the 4.9 acres of land as an exception to the property’s conveyance from one owner to
the next.

Gannon School
The building constructed on the 4.9-acre lot was a three-room wood structure with a cross-hipped
roof. A hipped-roof porch supported by a single pillar was located at the building cross section
(Figure 36). According to the Gannon School Teacher Daily Registers, first grade through
fourth-year high school were taught at the school. However, the grades taught in any given year
were dependent on the age and grade level of the pupils attending the school. The registers also
indicate that two teachers were employed at the school, one for the first through fourth grades and
77

the other for fifth grade through fourth-year high school. Classes were held Monday through
Friday, beginning at 9:00 A.M. and ending at 4:00 P.M., and operated for approximately nine
months of the year (Fisher County Pioneer Museum, Roby, Texas [FCPM], Teacher Daily
Register, 1919–1942).
Beginning in 1922, Fisher County Superintendent J. W. Hale began a vigorous program to
improve the county school system and began consolidating small rural schools with larger school
districts. The consolidation program continued until 1947 (Blount 1947:105–106). The Gannon
School was not affected by the consolidation program until 1942, when the school district
consolidated its high school student services with the Sweetwater School District in Nolan
County (ARN 30 August 1942:11). Only a few years later in 1945, the Gannon School District
was fully consolidated with the Sweetwater School District and ceased to provide any school
services (Yeats and Shelton 1971:100).
After 1945, the building was no longer used as a school; however, it continued to function as a
community center. In ca. 1950, a nondenominational church conducted Sunday school classes for
elementary-aged children and offered church services when a pastor was available. According to
Ardell Floyd, a former Sunday school teacher, “a local husband and wife operated the church and
during services he would play the saxophone and she would play the piano” (Ardell Floyd,
personal communication 2011). Other community activities held at the Gannon School building
included political meetings, such as the one held in 1952, by the Democratic party of Fisher
County for precinct No. 16 (ARN 2 May 1952:9B).

78

It is estimated that the Gannon School building was torn down ca. 1965. The building appears on
the 1940 and 1961 Fisher County highway maps, but does not appear on the 1969 Busby
topographic map (Figures 37–39) (GLO 1940 and 1961; Perry-Castañeda Library Map Collection
1969). This indicates that between 1961 and 1969 the building was demolished for reasons
unknown. Although the building was no longer present and the school district was no longer in
operation, the 4.9 acres of land on which the building was located continued to be noted on the
1970 deed granting ownership of the surrounding land to current owner Joe C. Duncan, Jr. (FCC
1970:DB 349:427). Today, the community of Gannon continues to exist, but consists of only a
few dwellings. The area has remained rural with the majority of development concentrated near
Sweetwater, Texas, in Nolan County.

Summary and Recommendations
The types of diagnostic materials observed suggest that the primary occupation period
represented by the artifacts is mid-twentieth century, ca. the 1930s–1950s, and testing indicates
that this site is likely not associated with site 41FS105. Some of the bricks identified also support
this suggestion. Fortunately, most of the structural features (cistern and foundation piers)
remained intact after the clearing, and a good footprint of the building remains extant. The site
still extends beyond the southern project corridor to at least CR 438, resulting in a new site area
of 70-x-42 m (2,940 m2 (230-x-138 ft; 31,740 ft2). Even though the initial deed title research was
inconclusive as to whether this property was the historic Gannon School, the more detailed
archival research conducted as mitigation for the site damage, as well as the size of the structure
and its location based on the historic maps and the landowner’s memory of the area, certainly

supports site 421FS104 as indeed the school location. The detailed archival information also
shows that the site was important to the people of Gannon for at least 7 or 8 years after the
building was no longer used as a school.
After the building was torn down in the mid-1960s, the site remained very much intact. Footings
for the structure, the cistern and associated features, concrete steps, etc., were left in place with
only limited cattle traffic though it until the easement was purchased by Oncor. Though much of
what was likely the schoolyard at the rear of the building was heavily disturbed by the clearing
for the transmission line and some activity areas or disposal features were impacted, the majority
of the structure’s footprint is outside of the current corridor. This area and what was the front and
side yards could possibly still yield information about the history of the property’s use and layout
of activity areas. Therefore, the status of this site is recommended as unknown for NRHP
inclusion or for SAL designation.

Original Oncor Corridor Survey

Archaeological Investigations
Site 41FS105 is a historic-age site found in the northwest corner of the intersection of CR 438
and the railroad track. Site size is 45-x-55 m (2,475 m2 [148-x-180 ft; 26,640 ft2]) and fence lines
are along both the north and south edges of the site. The entire site is likely contained within the
current project corridor. The railroad is approximately 20 m (66 ft) north of the site, and CR 428
is approximately 10 m (33 ft) south of the site. Site 41FS105 is separated by an approximately
80-m (263-ft) sterile gap from site 41FS104 and was initially thought to be potentially associated
with site 41FS104 (Figure 40; see Figure C7). Vegetation in the site area includes cacti,
mesquite, and grasses. Loamy clay to generally less than 45 cmbs was found across most of the
site, although several shovel tests extended 60–80 cmbs. The site appears to have fair to good
contextual integrity: the only disturbances noted were the fence lines along CR 438 and the
railroad, both of which are shown on the 1936 highway map.
When first investigated, a surface scatter containing “GLOBE” bricks, glass, nails, metal
fragments, wire, mason jars, brown glass, jars, and a barrel was noted. Modern trash was also
found along the fence lines, likely due to the proximity to both CR 438 and the railroad tracks.
The site boundary was determined by the extent of the surface scatter. In addition, 11 shovel tests
were dug within the site boundary, seven of which yielded 158 collected cultural artifacts from 0–
30 cmbs (Table 15). The only Activities item is a bolt with an attached square nut. Architectural
specimens consist eight fragments of window glass and nine wire nails. The majority of the
classifiable material was classified as Domestic items. Three pieces of whiteware represent body
sherds and a cup handle. Glass consists of an aqua faceted bottle, ash tint (n=11, post-1915; Lebo
1995) fragments, clear (n=13, post-1880; Kendrick 1971) vessel and table glass fragments, and
four table glass fragments of milk glass. Five Personal items were recovered: an amber/brown
whole bottle with an Owens ring (post-1910; Kendrick 1971), embossed with “CETS/17,” and a
clear glass applicator; a rubber bottle stopper; and a modern plastic belt buckle (post-1942). Five
Indeterminate glass and metal fragments as well as 98 pieces of wire make up the remaining
assemblage.

Archival Investigations
The closest structure noted on either the 1936 or 1961 editions of the General Highway Map of
Fisher County, Texas (Texas State Highway Department 1936, 1961a) is a school situated to the
north across the railroad track from this site. A structure in proximity of the site to the west is
noted on the 1936 edition (however, not on the 1961 edition), but it is farther away than the
school. Nonetheless, it is unlikely that these remains are associated with the school, especially
since both the county road and railroad track are extant on both maps.
Site 41FS105 is located on the southeast quarter of Section 4, Block 22, of the Texas and Pacific
Railroad surveys in Fisher County, Texas. According to the Texas GLO (2010d), the property
was patented in 1909 to J. B. Starr. Archival research conducted at the Fisher County Clerk’s
office traced the property’s chain of ownership back to 1926. Between 1909 and 1926, the land
was granted to Fred Roberts and wife M. E. Roberts, who in 1938 granted the property to Joe B.
Taylor and wife Edna Taylor (FCC 1926:DB 75:329; FCC 1938:DB 107:419). In 1941, Joe and

Edna Taylor granted the property to Hudson Taylor and wife Flora Taylor, who maintained
ownership of the property until 1970, at which time they sold it to the current owner, Joe C.
Duncan Jr. (FCC 1941:DB 116:272; FCC 1970:DB 349:427).

Summary
Site 41FS105 is an extensive historic scatter initially thought to potentially be associated with site
41FS104 to the west, though an 80-m gap exists between the two sites. Dense historic deposits
(which include the 98 pieces of wire) were found in ST L9, but the surrounding units were less
dense. The materials observed at the site appear to indicate a twentieth-century occupation. If
this site is an outer trash remnant of site 41FS104, it could offer additional information on discard
patterns during the early to mid-twentieth century. Given these circumstances, the research
potential for site 41FS105 is considered unknown for NRHP inclusion or for designation as an
SAL and the site should be avoided if possible.

Reroute Corridor Investigations
Subsequent to survey of the original transmission corridor, a slight reroute shifted the corridor in
the area adjacent to site 41FS105. Therefore, additional investigation was planned within the
reroute corridor at the site. The site was initially located on the northern edge of the original
route. The reroute overlapped the original corridor and shifted the project boundary
approximately 30 m (98 ft) to the south, so even less of the site area was affected. Upon arriving
at the site in early January 2011 for additional archaeological work, the tower construction in the
area had already been completed. The entire property had been clear-cut, and the transmission
towers were already standing. A surface survey and impact evaluation was conducted over the
site, resulting in the assessment that the majority of the site was intact and outside of the final
reroute corridor because the new alignment angled away from the site (Figure 41).

NRHP Testing
Very few artifacts were observed on the surface within the reroute corridor, but the scatter of
domestic items and bricks was still visible immediately outside and north of the reroute corridor.
Four 50-x-50-cm test units were excavated within a disturbed area within the southern half of the
site. Two of the test units were culturally sterile. Very few artifacts (n=8) were observed in the
other two test units (Table 5), and excavations were terminated at 40 cm due to a lack of
recovery. The only time-diagnostic artifacts recovered are Architectural items consisting of an
electrical connector (post-1922) and a fragment of clear plate glass (post-1880), as well as
Domestic items of pink Depression-era pressed table glass (1920–1950), all from TU 3; and an
ash tint body sherd (post-1915) from TU 1. These items place the occupation of this site in the
early to mid-twentieth century.

Summary and Recommendations
Based on the results of the testing investigations, it was determined that this site was only
minimally affected by the construction activities that had occurred because the final reroute
corridor alignment angled southward away from the site. A surface survey and impact evaluation
conducted over the site resulted in the assessment that the majority of the site was intact and
outside of the reroute corridor. Testing also confirmed that the site is now primarily north of the
85

reroute corridor, where the majority of the cultural material was found, and indicated that this site
is likely not associated with site 41FS104. Archival investigations also failed to reveal data
pertinent to NRHP Criteria a–d (36 CFR Part 60.4 [a-d]) or to SAL designation criteria (Title 9,
Chapter 191). Because the entire site is now entirely outside the project corridor, the
recommendations originally proposed for site 41FS105 have not changed; the site is considered to
be of unknown eligibility for NRHP inclusion or SAL designation. No further work within the
project corridor is necessary at the site.

Site 41FS106 (Locus 15a-1)
Site 41FS106 is a multicomponent site found on the edge of an upland overlooking Kildoogan
Creek. The site occupies an area of 130-x-40 m (5,200 m2 [426.5-x-131 ft; 55,970 ft2]) in size
and is oriented northwest–southeast, likely all within the project corridor (Figure 42; see Figure
C7). Vegetation at the site included thick grasses, yucca, cacti, and a few trees. Shovel testing
found bedrock or decomposed bedrock very near the ground surface in most cases, though several
units were excavated through sandy clay loam to 60–80 cmbs. Disturbances noted at the site
include erosion, railroad construction, and fence construction. A fence parallels the railroad and a
modern agricultural terrace was noted along the east side of the fence. The yucca was densest
along this terrace. In addition, a modern hunting blind is about 20 m (66 ft) north of the site.
The site was identified by a dense surface scatter of lithics. Six shovel tests were excavated
within the site boundary, but no cultural deposits were found in these units. A small surface
collection of prehistoric materials was made: the extreme tip of an Edwards chert biface, likely
the tip of a dart point based on the retouch and extant width and thickness; a complete Edwards
chert core; and three unmodified flakes, two of Edwards chert and one of translucent chert (Table
17).
Among the surface scatter were smaller quantities of historic ceramics, glass, and a cartridge
case. One historic artifact was collected from the site: a Bristol exterior/natural clay slipped
interior ceramic fragment (1890–1915; Greer 1981; Lebo 1992) from the site surface (Table 18).
Site 41FS106 was likely a small lithic reduction area that retains little research value. Likewise,
the historic materials are sparse, possibly from a dump episode, containing little to no research
value. The site is not shown on either the 1936 or 1961 editions of the General Highway Map of
Fisher County, Texas (Texas State Highway Department 1936, 1961a). Due to the small size,
disturbances, land lack of cultural deposits, features, or diagnostic materials, both components of
the site are considered not eligible for NRHP inclusion or for designation as an SAL, and no more
archaeological work is recommended for site 41FS106.

Site 41FS107 (Locus 15.1a-1)
Site 41FS107 is a prehistoric site located on the edge of an upland overlooking Kildoogan Creek.
The site occupies an area of 4-x-2 m (8 m2 [13-x-6.6 ft; 86 ft2]), oriented northeast–southwest and
contained within the project corridor (Figure 43; see Figure C7). Vegetation at the site consists of
grasses and a few scrub trees. The site appears to have fair to good contextual integrity, with only
minor disturbances from erosion, cattle grazing, and trampling noted.

The site was identified when a small scatter of Edwards chert flakes was observed on the surface.
One shovel test was dug to 60 cmbs (before hitting degraded bedrock) in the center of the highest
concentration of the surface scatter, but did not contain any cultural materials. The observed
flakes were all varieties of Edwards chert. Six unmodified flakes were selectively surfacecollected: four biface thinning flakes, one tertiary flake, and one thin flake fragment (Table 19).
Although the site appears to have fair to good contextual integrity, site 41FS107 appears to have
little research potential based on its small size, lack of diagnostic materials, and lack of
subsurface deposits. Thus, site 41FS107 is considered not eligible for NRHP inclusion or for
designation as an SAL. No further archaeological work is recommended at this site.

Site 41FS109 (Locus 17.1a-1)—Reroute and Tested

Original Oncor Corridor Survey
Site 41FS109 is a prehistoric lithic scatter of an undetermined period found adjacent to Kildoogan
Creek. The site boundary was defined solely through the surface scatter within the observable
portion of a road because the landowner did not allow excavation on the property and the thick
vegetation prohibited visual inspection of the ground surface outside the dirt road. The
observable portion of the site covers an area of 260-x-15 m (3,900 m² [853-x-49 ft, 41,797 ft²]) in
size (Figure 44; see Figure C8) but extends beyond the corridor. Thick vegetation consisted of
grasses, mesquite, shrub bushes, cacti, and briers. The site has been affected by railroad
construction along the northeast side of the site and the dirt road within which the site
predominantly lies.

The landowner did not permit artifact collection or subsurface investigations on this property.
The artifacts observed included debitage, shatter, and a possible edge-modified chert flake. No
diagnostic artifacts or features were noted.
The research potential is unclear due to the lack of subsurface investigations. Consequently, the
site is considered of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP. It is recommended that the
proposed construction avoid placing towers within the site area. If this is not possible, further
investigations will be required within the portion of the site within the corridor.

Reroute Corridor Investigations
Once the corridor property was formally acquired and the reroute corridor (shifting the original
corridor approximately 10 m [33 ft] southwest) was established, shovel testing was conducted on
December 9–10, 2010. By this time, Oncor contractors had hand-cleared an approximately 15-m­
wide (49 ft) path through the property, just wide enough to provide access for rubber-tired
vehicles. Trees, brush, and other cut vegetation were left in piles along the edges of the clearing.
Though the site area had been cleared in this fashion, no additional disturbance appeared to have
been caused to the site as a result of the clearing activities. The prior disturbances to the site
(railroad and existing dirt road) are still the most prominent factors limiting the site integrity
within the project corridor. Shovel tests revealed silty loam to depths of generally 50–60 cmbs,
although several extended to 65–70 cmbs.
The shovel test inventory across the property was conducted in a high-probability 30-m [98-ft)
interval (see Figure 44). Within this regular interval, 11 of the 26 total shovel tests within the site
were positive for archaeological materials (Table 20). One of the three delineation shovel tests at
the northern end of the site was among these positive tests. The positive shovel tests yielded 17
flakes: two were of Edwards chert (STs L1 and R1), 15 were of translucent chert. Five were
tertiary flakes and the others were flake fragments. Three came from the surfaces of the shovel
tests; seven were recovered from 0–20 cmbs; six from 20–40 cmbs; and one from 40–80 cmbs.
The presence of surficial materials and 11 positive shovel tests confidently placed the site
boundary between the banks of Kildoogan Creek on the north and Dulaney Creek to the
2
2
southeast, changing the site size to 370-x-65 m (24,050 m [1,214-x-213 ft or 258,582 ft ]).
Given that this high terrace continues for a considerable distance outside of the project corridor, it
is very likely that the site continues outside of the corridor. The shovel testing also suggests that
the site is concentrated within the upper 40 cm of the soil profile. However, one shovel test at the
eastern end of the site (ST L8) produced one flake at the 40–80-cm level.

NRHP Testing
Prior to shovel testing at site 41FS109, the site had been recommended for avoidance or
monitoring since no subsurface excavation was permitted. A transmission tower was planned for
placement in this site, so test units were proposed both in the area of impact surrounding the
tower area and elsewhere throughout the site. The transmission tower placement and an impact
buffer area of approximately roughly 46 m NW/SE by 64 m NE/SW (2,944 m2 [150 ft NW/SE by
210 ft NE/SW; 31,500 ft2]) was approximately 90 m southeast of the northwestern edge of the
site and approximately 180 m from southeastern edge of the site, within the corridor (see Figure
44).
Eleven test units (which included a three-unit block) were placed within the site. Given that the
transmission tower and impact area were both within the site boundary, the test excavations were
primarily placed within this area. Test excavations consisted of four 50-x-50-cm units (TUs 2–5)
placed individually within each quadrant of the impact area and one 1-x-1-m unit (TU 1) directly
in the location of the proposed transmission tower. Based on the results of these excavations, a 1­
x-3-m unit (TUs 6–8) was also excavated in the high artifact density area on the southeastern side
of the impact area. Additionally, three 50-x-50-cm units (TUs 9–11) were placed southeast of the
impact area to test for artifact variability across the entire site area.
Each of the 50-x-50-cm units (TUs 2–5) within the corners of the impact area was excavated in
10-cm levels. The results of the test unit excavations indicated that the artifact density was quite
variable across different portions of the site. TUs 2 and 5 were located on the northwestern side
of the impact area. Neither of these units yielded any cultural materials (Table 21). TU 3 was
located in the northeast quadrant of the impact area. This unit contained a total of 26 pieces of

translucent chert unmodified debitage to a maximum depth of 30 cmbs. This also contrasts with
the density observed in TU 4 (two flakes, one translucent chert and one Edwards chert), located in
the southeast quadrant of the impact area (see Table 21). All of the test units appeared to have a
similar soil profile consisting of a plowzone of strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) silt loam to a depth of
approximately 30 cm. Below this was a zone of increased clay content with a slightly darker
color (7.5YR 3/4–7.5YR 4/4).
TU 1 was a 1-x-1-m unit placed at the location of the proposed tower. This unit was excavated to
a maximum depth of 50 cmbs. Only two chert flakes were recovered between 10 and 30 cmbs
(Table 22). Based on the combination of 50-x-50-cm units and the 1-x-1-m unit, it was
determined that the densest portion of the impact area was likely within the northeastern
quadrant. Therefore, a 1-x-3-m-block was excavated near the edge of the northeastern quadrant,
consisting of TUs 6, 7, and 8, oriented south to north in this area. The soil profile in this area was
also very similar to that observed elsewhere at the site. The artifact concentration also appeared
to be concentrated in the upper 40 cm of the profile (Table 23). The majority of the recovered
artifacts came from within the plow zone in the upper 30–40 cm of the profile. Within TU 6, 29
flakes and one biface fragment were recovered in the upper 40 cm. The fossiliferous chert biface
fragment (FS 269/1) is the proximal end of the late aborted tool but cannot be assigned to a
specific time period or date range (Figure 45).

Given that a large portion of the site existed southeast of the proposed impact area, the variation
in artifact density was questioned across the entire site length. Three 50-x-50-cm test units (TUs
9, 10, 11) were excavated east of the impact area in order to help determine the best locations to
place additional large excavations in the event that the entire site would be impacted. Only one
Edwards chert flake was recovered from TU 9 (0–10 cmbs) as a result of these excavations.
Therefore, it seems likely that the densest portion of the site is within the impact area for the
transmission tower. However, since no diagnostic or datable materials were identified in any of
the investigations, the site research potential is limited.

95

Summary and Recommendations
Site 41FS109, though originally considered of unknown eligibility partly due to the lack of shovel
testing during the original survey, yielded little new information based on the shovel testing and
additional larger test units placed in the impact area and elsewhere on the site within the project
area. The lack of diagnostics, datable material, surface or subsurface features, low density of
material across the site, erosion, and artificial impacts such as the dirt road through the site and
the railroad tracks to the northeast restrict the research potential for the portion of the site within
the corridor. Nonetheless, since the site extends beyond the project corridor to the southwest, site
41FS109 is still recommended as of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP or for
designation as an SAL. However, this portion of site 41FS109 within the project corridor would
not contribute to the site’s eligibility if it were later determined eligible.

Site 41FS110 (Locus 17.1a-x)—Revisited
Site 41FS110 is a prehistoric lithic scatter of an undetermined period found on a small terrace
over Kildoogan Creek. The site, found in a high probability zone, covers an area of 75-x-50 m
(3,750 m² [246-x-165 ft, 40,590 ft²]) within the corridor (Figure 46; see Figure C8) but extends
beyond the corridor to the southwest. Vegetation consists of wild grasses, cacti, yucca, shrub
bushes, and small cedar and mesquite trees. The site has likely been affected by railroad
construction to the northeast.
At the time of the original survey, the landowner did not permit shovel testing. Once shovel
testing was allowed in December 2010, the site boundary was defined by the lithic materials
found in shovel test units; dense vegetation prohibited ground visibility, obscuring any materials
that might have occurred on the surface. Silt loam revealed in the shovel tests met clay at
generally less than 50–60 cmbs.
Four of the 19 shovel tests excavated to define the site limits contained cultural materials (Table
24). Four of the five flakes found in the positive shovel tests were within the upper 20 cm, but
one flake was found at a depth of 35 cmbs. All of the flakes were of a variety of Edwards chert.
No diagnostic artifacts or features were noted.
The research potential for the portion of the site within the project corridor is considered poor due
to the low density of materials found, lack of diagnostics, and absence of intact features.
However, since the site extends beyond the current corridor and cannot be fully evaluated, site
41FS110 is considered of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as an
SAL. The portion of the site within the corridor, nevertheless, would not contribute to the site’s
eligibility if it were later determined eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, and thus no further
archaeological investigations will be required at site 41FS110 within the corridor.

Site 41FS111 (Locus 18.a-x)—Revisited
Site 41FS111 is a prehistoric lithic scatter of an undetermined period situated on a small terrace
on the south bank of Dulaney Creek near its confluence with Kildoogan Creek. The site, found in
a high probability zone, covers an area of 95-x-50 m (4,750 m² [312-x-165 ft, 51,480 ft²]) within
the project corridor but may extend beyond the corridor (Figure 47; see Figure C8). Vegetation
consists of wild grasses, mixed cacti, and small mesquite trees. Interestingly, the 1.5-m-high
bank of the creek indicated alluvial deposition, but no evidence of a buried soil was observed.
The site has likely been affected by railroad construction to the northeast, a two-track road that
runs through it, and erosion as a result of cattle and vehicular traffic.
At the time of the original survey, the landowner allowed no shovel testing, and heavy vegetation
precluded any surface indications of a site at this location. However, on the return visit in
December 2010 after access to shovel test the parcel was permitted, the vegetation had thinned
and ground visibility was much better. Shovel tests showed silt loam to generally 45–50 cmbs,
although one unit extended to 60 cmbs.
The site boundary was defined solely by the lithic materials noted on the surface since no artifacts
were found in shovel tests. A minimal scatter (approximately 20 pieces across the length of the
site) of flakes, shatter, cores, and one lithic with bifacial flaking (Figure 48) were observed,
primarily in the two-track roadbed. No diagnostic artifacts or features were noted on the surface
or in subsurface contexts. No cultural material was collected.
The research potential for the portion of the site within the project corridor is considered poor due
to the low density of materials, the lack of diagnostics and subsurface artifacts, and the absence of
features. However, since the site extends beyond the current corridor and cannot be fully
evaluated, the site is considered of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP or for
designation as an SAL. The portion of site 41FS111 within the corridor, however, would not
contribute to the site’s eligibility if it were later determined eligible for inclusion in the NRHP,
and thus no further archaeological investigations will be required within the corridor.

Site 41FS112 (Locus 18.a-x)—Revisited
Site 41FS112 is a prehistoric lithic scatter of an undetermined period situated east of Dulaney
Creek near its confluence with Kildoogan Creek. The site, found in a high probability zone,
covers an area of 105-x-50 m (5,250 m² [345-x-164 ft, 56,580 ft²]) within the project corridor but
may extend beyond the corridor (see Figure 47; see Figure C8). Vegetation consists of wild
grasses, mixed cacti, and small mesquite trees. The site has likely been affected by railroad
construction to the northeast and natural erosion due to cattle traffic.
At the time of the original survey, the landowner allowed no shovel testing. Once shovel testing
was allowed in December 2010, the site boundary was defined by the lithic materials found in
shovel test units since dense vegetation prohibiting ground visibility obscured any materials that
might have occurred on the surface. Shovel tests revealed silt loam to a depth of generally 50–60
cmbs. Four flakes were found in three shovel tests (Table 25); one tertiary flake showed edge
modification but the others were unmodified. Two of the flakes were found within the upper 20
cm and two were found between 20 and 40 cmbs. All of the flakes were manufactured from a
variety of Edwards of chert.
The research potential for the portion of the site within the project corridor is considered poor due
to the low density of materials, lack of diagnostics, and absence of intact features. However,
since the site extends beyond the current corridor and cannot be fully evaluated, the site is
considered of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as an SAL.
Nonetheless, the portion of site 41FS112 within the corridor would not contribute to the site’s
eligibility if it were later determined eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, and thus no further
archaeological investigations will be required within the corridor.

Nolan County Sites

Site 41NL72 (Locus 158.1a-1)

Previous Investigations
Site 41NL72 was first recorded by Foy Steadman. Unfortunately, the information on the Key
Site Card in the Atlas is limited and does not give the date of investigation. When originally
recorded, 10 dart points were surface-collected, indicating an occupation during the Archaic
period. Once again, the types of dart points collected are not recorded on the Key Site Card.

Current Archaeological Investigations
Site 41NL72 is a multicomponent site found on a sloping upland surface. Two first-order
drainages cross through the site area. The site measures 350-x-50 m (17,500 m² [1148-x-164 ft;
188,272 ft²]) in size (Figure 49; see Figure C15) within the project right-of-way but extends
beyond the project corridor to the north and south, with the newly recorded portion of the site
expanding the site to the west. Vegetation in the western part of the site consists of sparse
grasses, but the grasses are much thicker in the eastern half of the site. Mesquite and juniper were
found along both of the drainages. Shovel testing revealed gravelly clay and clay loam to depths
of generally less than 35 cmbs and indicated that the extent of the erosion varies across the site,
but appears most damaging in the western half. Sinkholes are present west of the site.
The site was defined solely through surface scatter. Although 19 shovel tests were excavated
within the project corridor in the site vicinity, none contained cultural materials. Prehistoric
artifacts observed at site 41NL72 during the survey investigation included secondary and tertiary
flakes, edge-modified flakes, and a biface midsection. Two artifacts—an Edwards chert tertiary
flake and the biface fragment—were collected (Table 26). The biface midsection (FS 161/1) is
very thin and finely made and, based on its overall morphology of relatively straight lateral edges
(although one edge curves slightly inward, likely from edge damage), width, thickness,
andflaking pattern, may represent a Paleo-Indian projectile point (Figure 50).

Historic artifacts noted on the surface included unidentified metal fragments, a washtub, bottle
glass, historic ceramics, metal cans, and plastic buttons. A dense concentration of historic
artifacts noted in the western end of the site included bottle and jar glass (manganese/solarized
[1870s–1920; Lockhart 2006], brown, clear [post-1880; Kendrick 1971], olive, and cobalt blue),
milk glass, whiteware (post-1890; Moir 1987), and metal cans. No historic materials were
collected.

Archival Investigations
On the General Highway Map of Nolan County, Texas (Texas State Highway Department 1940),
a structure is shown directly south of the site location. Site 41NL72 is located on Survey 40,
Block 20, of the Texas and Pacific Railroad surveys in Nolan County, Texas. Archival research
conducted at the Nolan County Clerk’s office revealed that a patent to the property was issued in
1916 to S. H. Leslie (GLO 2010e). Between 1916 and 1923, the property was granted to L. E.
Adrian, who in 1923 granted the property to A. B. Driggers (Nolan County Clerk [NCC],
Sweetwater, Texas, 1923:DB 25:452). In 1974, A. B. Driggers died and ownership of the
property was transferred to heirs Louis Driggers, Mimie C. Wells Driggers, Annie Mae Driggers
Taylor, Willie Driggers Huffman, Katie Driggers Jones, Rose Driggers Weaver, Marshall
Dwayne Driggers, Margie A. Driggers Blalock, A. B. Driggers, Sherman Driggers, Myrtle C.
Driggers Perkins, and J. C. Driggers (NCC 1974:DB 225:281). Finally, also in 1974, the heirs of
A. B. Driggers granted the property to the current owner, J. C. Driggers and wife Marquata
Driggers (NCC 1974:DB 225:452).

Summary and Recommendations
Although when originally recorded, dart points indicating an Archaic occupation were found at
the site, the only formal tool observed during current investigations was the possible Paleo-Indian
projectile point midsection. The historic artifacts indicate an occupation in the late nineteenth or
early twentieth century, and the variety of materials observed suggests a homestead. The General
Highway Map of Nolan County, Texas (Texas State Highway Department 1940) supports this
indication, because a structure is shown directly south of the site location. However, the
prehistoric and historic components of the site within the project corridor have poor contextual
integrity due to extensive erosion, lack subsurface features or deposits, and archival investigations
failed to reveal data pertinent to NRHP Criteria a–d (36 CFR Part 60.4 [a-d]) or to SAL
designation criteria (Title 9, Chapter 191). Nonetheless, because portions of the site outside of
the project corridor were not assessed, the site is recommended as of unknown eligibility for
NRHP inclusion or for SAL designation. However, the portion of the site located with the project
corridor would not contribute to the site’s eligibility if it were later recommended for inclusion in
the NRHP. No further work is recommended within the corridor.

Site 41NL230 (Locus 19.01a-1/2/3)—Revisited

Archaeological Investigations
Site 41NL230 is a large, multicomponent site that occupies a hilltop and sloping upland surface
west of Kildoogan Creek. The site occupies an area of approximately 230-x-60 m (13,800 m²
[771-x-197 ft; 151,887 ft²]) within the project corridor, but extends beyond the project right-of­
way (Figure 51; see Figure C15). The northeastern corridor is bordered by the BNSF tracks, and
a channelized stream borders the corridor to the northeast along the railroad track. The site falls
along the divide between a medium probably zone to the north and high probability zone to the
south. Evidence of erosion consists of the bedrock exposure found on the hilltop, the gullies in
the center and eastern end of the site, and blowouts found along the terrace edge in the eastern
portion of the site. Vegetation at the site includes sparse grasses, cacti, and scrub brush.
Because neither subsurface investigation nor artifact collection was permitted on this property at
the time of the original survey, the site was initially defined solely through an observed surface
scatter of artifacts. The site was originally identified as three separate loci that were later
combined into one site. Locus 19.01a-1 was found on a hilltop in the western part of the site and
was identified by a scatter of lithic materials. Poorly cemented conglomerate bedrock fragments
105

were also visible at the surface of the hilltop. Locus 19.01a-2 was identified in the center of the
site and is associated with an erosion gully. The locus was composed of historic and prehistoric
materials. Locus 19.01a-3 occupies a terrace adjacent to Kildoogan Creek in the eastern part of
the site and was also represented by historic and prehistoric materials. This portion of the site has
also been significantly affected by erosion, with several large gullies emptying into the Kildoogan
Creek channel.
Prehistoric materials observed on the site included Edwards chert flakes and cores, edge-modified
flakes (including at least one scraper), a burin, and burned rock. No diagnostic artifacts or
features were noted. Observed historic artifacts consisted of a small dump of fruit jars,
miscellaneous cans, oilcans, aerosol cans, pull tab cans, twist top glass bottles, liquor bottles,
snuff bottles, and a porcelain light fixture at the edge of the gully. Larger historic artifacts (such
as 55-gallon drums, two full sets of bedsprings, bales of wire, and corrugated metal) were found
in the gully where they were presumably left to slow erosive processes.
Once the easement was purchased, shovel testing was conducted during a revisit in late
September 2010. The hill at the northwestern end of the site is very steep, with a gradual slope
southeastward to a steep drop-off down to Kildoogan Creek at the southeastern end of the site.
Since the northeastern part of the site adjacent to the corridor is within a medium-probability
zone, that portion of the site was shovel-tested at 200-m intervals. Only four of the nine shovel
tests excavated on the site contained material: a flake (40–60 cmbs) from ST L4, two flakes (0–
20 cmbs) from ST R2, a flake (30–40 cmbs) from ST R3, and a mussel shell fragment (0–20
cmbs) from ST R7. None of these items was collected.
Several pieces of metal enamelware were observed at the edge of the gully, one of which, a teapot
(1870s–1930s; Vogelzang and Welch 1986:14–15, 67), was collected (Table 27). The only other
historic artifact collected is an amber/brown glass snuff bottle (post-1920; Lebo 1995) with wellrounded shoulders, a ring cork closure (cork included), and three relief dots on the base.

Archival Investigations
Site 41NL230 is located on Survey 31, Block 20, of the Texas and Pacific Railroad surveys in
Nolan County, Texas. No structures are shown in this area on the General Highway Map of
Nolan County, Texas (Texas State Highway Department 1940). Archival research conducted at
the Nolan County Clerk’s office traced the chain of title for the property back to the patent deed
issued in 1874 to the Fidelity Insurance, Trust, and Safe Deposit Company, an assignee of the
Texas and Pacific Railroad Company (GLO 2010f). In 1885, the Fidelity Insurance, Trust, and
Safe Deposit Company conveyed the land to the Texas and Pacific Railroad Company, who
107

granted the property in 1887 to Charles J. Canda, Simeon J. Drake, and William Strauss. In 1902,
Daisy Strauss and Henry Strauss, as sole executors of the William Strauss estate, granted their
share of the property to Charles J. Canda, Simeon J. Drake, and Edwin Einstein. In 1905, Fanny
H. Einstein, sole executor of the estate of Edwin Einstein, granted her share of the property to
Charles J. Canda, Simeon J. Drake, and Sigmund Neustadt. In 1909, Agnes Neustadt, Casimir I.
Stralem, and Mortimer L. Schiff, executors of the Sigmund Neustadt estate, granted their share of
the property to Charles J. Canda, Simeon J. Drake, and Alphonse Kloh. In 1915, the executors of
the Simeon J. Drake estate, which include Craig F. R. Drake, Simeon J. Drake Jr., and Henry B.
Browne, and the executors of the Charles J. Canda estate, which include Charles A. Canda and
Abeel Canda, granted their share of the property to Alphose Kloh, Emil Baerwald, and David
Rumsey (NCC 1915:DB 23:296). In 1916, Alphose Kloh, Emil Baerwald, and David Rumsey
granted the property to Claude C. Rogers, who maintained ownership of the land until 1948, at
which time he granted the property to T. H. Bunton (NCC 1916:DB 26:158; NCC 1948:DB
131:322). Between 1948 and 1959, the property was granted to the Sweetwater Country Club,
excluding 86.44 acres granted to the Panhandle and Santa Fe Railway Company in 1952 (NCC
1959:DB 41:280). In 1972, the Sweetwater Country Club granted the property to R. E. Hendrick,
Bob L. Todd, and Edward E. Freeze (NCC 1972:DB 218:620). Finally, in 1983, Bob L. Todd
granted his share of the property to R. E. Hendrick, the current owner (NCC 1983:DB 259:752).

Summary and Recommendations
Interestingly, the artifacts observed on the site surface are primarily in the high-probability zone.
However, the prehistoric and historic components of site 41NL230 appear to have poor
contextual integrity due to erosion and possibly construction activities and are considered to have
little to no remaining research potential within the corridor. The extensive evidence of erosion
suggests that it is unlikely that significant cultural deposits still exist at the site within the project
corridor. Railroad construction north of the site almost certainly has affected site integrity, as has
the channelized stream. Archival investigations failed to reveal data pertinent to NRHP Criteria
a–d (36 CFR Part 60.4 [a-d]) or to SAL designation criteria (Title 9, Chapter 191). However,
since the site extends beyond the project corridor and the full site was not assessed, site 41NL230
is considered of unknown eligibility for NRHP inclusion or for SAL designation. Nonetheless,
the portion of the site within the project corridor would not contribute to the site’s significance if
later determined to be NRHP eligible. Therefore, no additional work is required within the
project corridor at site 41NL230.

Site 41NL231 (Locus 19.01b-2)—Reroute

Original Oncor Corridor Survey

Archaeological Investigations
Site 41NL231 is a multicomponent historic and prehistoric occupation found on a small hilltop
and associated slopes. The site covers an area of 175-x-50 m (8,750 m² [574-x-164 ft; 94,136
ft²]) within the right-of-way, but the site extends beyond the limit of the project corridor (Figure
52; see Figure C9). The site is in an open pasture, with vegetation consisting of grasses and small
108

amounts of cacti and brush. Disturbances noted at the site include a moderate amount of erosion
along the slopes, agricultural terracing, and recent dumping. Soils were thin, with no more than
10 cm of soil found above the bedrock.
The site was defined by a surface scatter because all 10 shovel tests excavated at the site were
sterile. The prehistoric assemblage included Edwards chert flakes, cores, shatter, and utilized
flakes. No diagnostic artifacts were observed. The historic materials included wooden planks,
metal pipes with concrete blocks at one end, and telephone poles; the metal pipes are probably
some kind of post. No cultural material was collected at this site.

Archival Investigations
Site 41NL231 is located on Survey 31, Block 20, of the Texas and Pacific Railroad surveys in
Nolan County, Texas. The only structure shown in this area on the General Highway Map of
Nolan County, Texas (Texas State Highway Department 1940) is approximately 200 m south of
the site. A modern house and two barns a short distance south of the project corridor are likely
related to the historic materials.
Archival research conducted at the Nolan County Clerk’s office traced the chain of title for the
property back to the patent deed issued in 1874 to the Fidelity Insurance, Trust, and Safe Deposit
Company, an assignee of the Texas and Pacific Railroad Company (GLO 2010f). In 1885, the
Fidelity Insurance, Trust, and Safe Deposit Company conveyed the land to the Texas and Pacific
Railroad Company, who granted the property in 1887 to Charles J. Canda, Simeon J. Drake, and
William Strauss. In 1902, Daisy Strauss and Henry Strauss, as sole executors of the William
Strauss estate, granted their share of the property to Charles J. Canda, Simeon J. Drake, and
Edwin Einstein. In 1905, Fanny H. Einstein, sole executor of the estate of Edwin Einstein,
granted her share of the property to Charles J. Canda, Simeon J. Drake, and Sigmund Neustadt.
In 1909, Agnes Neustadt, Casimir I. Stralem, and Mortimer L. Schiff, executors of the Sigmund
Neustadt estate, granted their share of the property to Charles J. Canda, Simeon J. Drake, and
Alphonse Kloh. In 1915, the executors of the Simeon J. Drake estate, which include Craig F. R.
Drake, Simeon J. Drake Jr., and Henry B. Browne, and the executors of the Charles J. Canda
estate, which include Charles A. Canda and Abeel Canda, granted their share of the property to
Alphose Kloh, Emil Baerwald, and David Rumsey (NCC 1915:DB 23:296). In 1916, Alphose
Kloh, Emil Baerwald, and David Rumsey granted the property to Claude C. Rogers, who
maintained ownership of the land until 1948, at which time he granted the property to T. H.
Bunton (NCC 1916:DB 26:158; NCC 1948:DB 131:322). Between 1948 and 1959, the property
was granted to the Sweetwater Country Club, excluding 86.44 acres granted to the Panhandle and
Santa Fe Railway Company in 1952 (NCC 1959:DB 41:280). In 1972, the Sweetwater Country
Club granted the property to R. E. Hendrick, Bob L. Todd, and Edward E. Freeze (NCC 1972:DB
218:620). Finally, in 1983, Bob L. Todd granted his share of the property to R. E. Hendrick, the
current owner (NCC 1983:DB 259:752).

Reroute Corridor Investigations
A small amount of new reroute corridor was established along the southwest side of the original
corridor, shifting the project area obliquely away from the original corridor, variously, by 4–15 m
(13–49 ft). This small area was visually inspected, but no additional cultural materials not
110

previously noted were identified. The site size, however, was increased to 175-x-60 m (10,500
m² [574-x-197 ft; 113,078 ft²]). The site is still considered to extend beyond the project area to
both the northeast and southwest.

Summary and Recommendations
The prehistoric and historic components of site 41NL231 are considered to have poor research
potential within the project corridor since no diagnostic artifacts or features were found. In
addition, the site has poor contextual integrity because of erosion along the slopes, agricultural
terracing, and thin soils. Archival investigations failed to reveal data pertinent to NRHP Criteria
a–d (36 CFR Part 60.4 [a-d]) or to SAL designation criteria (Title 9, Chapter 191). However, the
entire site is has not been fully assessed, and therefore the site is recommended as of unknown
NRHP eligibility or SAL designation. The portion within the project corridor would not
contribute to the site’s eligibility if it were later determined eligible. No further work is
recommended for this portion of site 41NL231 within the corridor.

Site 41NL232 (Locus 19.01c-1)—Revisited

Archaeological Investigations
Site 41NL232 is a multicomponent historic and prehistoric occupation site found on a gently
sloping upland surface near the confluence of Kildoogan Creek and a second-order tributary. The
site encompasses an area of 95-x-30 m (2,850 m² [312-x-98 ft; 30,576 ft²]) in size within the
right-of-way but extends beyond the project corridor to the northeast between the project
boundary and the railroad (Figure 53; see Figure C9). The site is devoid of vegetation, but the
surrounding area consists of grasses and scrub with all the hardwoods removed. Contextual
integrity has been compromised due to extensive recent ground disturbances, bedrock exposures,
and an actively used dirt road that have resulted in heavy erosion.
At the time of the original survey, the site boundary was established solely by the extensive
surface scatter because neither subsurface investigations nor artifact collection were permitted by
the landowner. The surface artifact scatter was dense, with both historic and prehistoric artifacts
mixed together. The highest concentration of both artifact types was found on a small mound and
along the fence line. The ground was generally bare in this area due to seemingly constant sheet
erosion.
Observed prehistoric materials included chert flakes, cores, bifaces, edge-modified flakes, and an
untyped projectile point partial blade and base fragment (Figure 54). Observed historic materials
included bottle glass (clear [post-1880; Kendrick 1971], brown, cobalt, and manganese/solarized
[1870s–1920; Lockhart 2006]), as well as a milk glass jar, decorated porcelain, ironstone (1850–
1910; Moir 1987), salt-glazed stoneware (1840–1900; Greer 1981; Lebo 1992), porcelain buttons
(post 1840; Peacock 1972), a broken doorknob, modern metal cans, a tire, manganese/solarized
pressed glass (1850s–1920; Lockhart 2006), two bottle necks, a possible metal clasp, and a
railroad spike (Figure 55).

Once the easement was purchased, shovel testing was conducted on a revisit to site 41NL262 in
fall 2010. Extensive ground disturbances had been introduced subsequent to the initial site visit,
both within and beyond the current project right-of-way (Figure 56; see Figure 53); much of the
site appeared to have been grubbed/cleared with tracked vehicles, leaving large areas of exposed
hillocky earth and bedrock. The southwestern edge of the site is firmly established by the surface
scatter and lack of positive shovel tests, and although several artifacts were observed beyond the
northeastern edge of the project corridor, that area is on ground that has been highly disturbed by
a two-track road and the railroad, likely destroying any site that may have once existed there.
Soils at the site were a sandy silty loam generally less than 25 cm in depth.

56. Photos showing extensive disturbance to site 41NL232, facing north

Figure 56. Photos showing extensive disturbance to site 41NL232, facing north.

During the revisit, three of the eight shovel tests in the vicinity of the site were considered
positive solely because artifacts were found on the surface of the shovel test locations: two clear
bottle glass sherds, one rubber shoe sole, and three flakes from ST L5; two whiteware sherds, one
mussel shell fragment, and two pieces of bottle glass (clear and cobalt) from ST L7; and one
piece of coal from ST L8. However, none of these materials was collected.
Only one prehistoric artifact was collected from the site surface: a late aborted biface (FS 214/1),
broken at approximately midblade, that is a possible projectile point preform (Figure 57) (Table
28). The biface is relatively thin, but with no edge retouch, and retains a patch of cortex on one
face that likely was the reason for abandonment. One face of the biface seems to be primarily
Edwards chert but approximately one-third of this face and the opposite face appear to be
fossiliferous chert. The observed projectile point blade/base fragment noted on the initial visit
could not be found on the revisit, but other observed surficial material consisted of lithic
manufacturing debris, bifaces, and edge-modified flakes, as on the original visit.
The 10 collected historic artifacts from the general site surface (Table 29) consist of Architectural
tile (a blue glaze ceramic); Domestic ceramics (a light ivory tinted whiteware fragment with over
the glaze floral polychrome decalcomania that has been burned and has a partial dark green
maker's mark “Ivory . . .”) and two glass bottle fragments (one, a light green bottle neck with a
double ring cork closure [1900–1940; Lebo 1995] and the other a manganese/solarized body
sherd [1870s–1920; Lockhart 2006]). Personal items consist of glass jars—an amber/brown
possible pill bottle with an Owens-Illinois maker’s mark (1929–1954; Toulouse 1971:403), three

fragments of a cobalt blue Vicks Vapor Rub jar with a partial relief maker’s mark (post-1910),
and a milk glass cosmetic jar (post-1890)—as well as an metal ocular piece from binoculars with
a “LEMAIRE FABT, PARIS” mark (ca. 1890s). The Paris company produced both military and
opera glasses in the late 1800s–early 1900s, and although the collected fragment is too small to
definitively type, it is most similar to opera glasses (French LEMAIRE Binoculars 2011a, 2011b).

Archival Investigations
Site 41NL232 is located on Survey 31, Block 20, of the Texas and Pacific Railroad surveys in
Nolan County, Texas. The types and variety of historic artifacts observed suggest a residential
occupation; however, no structure is shown in this area on the General Highway Map of Nolan
County, Texas (Texas State Highway Department 1940). Archival research conducted at the
Nolan County Clerk’s office traced the chain of title for the property back to the patent deed
issued in 1874 to the Fidelity Insurance, Trust, and Safe Deposit Company, an assignee of the
Texas and Pacific Railroad Company (GLO 2010f). In 1885, the Fidelity Insurance, Trust, and
Safe Deposit Company conveyed the land to the Texas and Pacific Railroad Company, who
granted the property in 1887 to Charles J. Canda, Simeon J. Drake, and William Strauss. In 1902,
Daisy Strauss and Henry Strauss, as sole executors of the William Strauss estate, granted their
share of the property to Charles J. Canda, Simeon J. Drake, and Edwin Einstein. In 1905, Fanny
H. Einstein, sole executor of the estate of Edwin Einstein, granted her share of the property to
Charles J. Canda, Simeon J. Drake, and Sigmund Neustadt. In 1909, Agnes Neustadt, Casimir I.
Stralem, and Mortimer L. Schiff, executors of the Sigmund Neustadt estate granted their share of
the property to Charles J. Canda, Simeon J. Drake, and Alphonse Kloh. In 1915, the executors of
the Simeon J. Drake estate, which include Craig F. R. Drake, Simeon J, Drake Jr., Henry B.
Browne, and the executors of the Charles J. Canda estate, which include Charles A. Canda and
Abeel Canda, granted their share of the property to Alphose Kloh, Emil Baerwald, and David
Rumsey (NCC 1915:DB 23:296). In 1916, Alphose Kloh, Emil Baerwald, and David Rumsey
granted the property to Claude C. Rogers, who maintained ownership of the land until 1948, at
which time he granted the property to T. H. Bunton (NCC 1916:DB 26:158; NCC 1948:DB
131:322). Between 1948 and 1959, the property was granted to the Sweetwater Country Club,
excluding 86.44 acres granted to the Panhandle and Santa Fe Railway Company in 1952 (NCC
1959:DB 41:280). In 1972, the Sweetwater Country Club granted the property to R. E. Hendrick,
Bob L. Todd, and Edward E. Freeze (NCC 1972:DB 218:620). Finally, in 1983, Bob L. Todd
granted his share of the property to R. E. Hendrick, the current owner (NCC 1983:DB 259:752).

Summary and Recommendations
Although site 41NL232 once apparently extended beyond the current project right-of-way,
extensive ground disturbances have been introduced since the initial site visit, both within and
beyond the current site boundary to the south, and the two-track and railroad disturbance to the
northeast have likely affected any site extending to the north. Though a dense artifact scatter was
observed, the context of these materials has been compromised. Archival investigations failed to
reveal data pertinent to NRHP Criteria a–d (36 CFR Part 60.4 [a-d]) or to SAL designation
criteria (Title 9, Chapter 191). The prehistoric and historic components of site 41NL232 within
the project corridor are considered to have little to no research potential because of the
disturbances, coupled with the presence of surface bedrock and the lack of any subsurface
deposits. Therefore, the entirety of site 41NL232 is recommended not eligible for inclusion in the
NRHP or for designation as an SAL, and no additional work is required at site 41NL232.

Site 41NL233 (Locus 23a-2)
Site 41NL233 is a prehistoric lithic scatter of unknown age found along a gently sloping upland
landform. The site is 90-x-40 m (3,600 m² [295-x-131 ft; 38,645 ft²]) in size within the project
right-of-way, as determined by the surface scatter and by shovel testing and, though it may have
extended outside the northeastern boundary at one time, is currently likely contained within the
project corridor (Figure 58; see Figure C10). A railroad immediately northeast of the site has
likely destroyed the original site portion that once probably extended into this area. Other
disturbances noted include erosion, a cattle trough, cattle trails, and fence construction, giving the
site poor to fair contextual integrity. Vegetation consists of grasses, cacti, and a small amount of
mesquite. Bedrock exposures were found within the site boundary, and silty soil with gravel and
caliche was generally less than 45 cm in depth.
Artifacts observed on the surface included chert tested cobbles, cores and core fragments, and
primary, secondary, and tertiary flakes. Four of the eight onsite shovel tests yielded artifacts: an
Edwards chert core, and unmodified debitage of three flakes (two Edwards chert and one
translucent chert) and three pieces of Edwards chert shatter (Table 30). All collected materials
from the shovel tests were recovered from 0–30 cmbs.
A reroute corridor overlapped with and slightly extended the original project area by less than
20 m (66 ft) along the southwestern edge of the original corridor adjacent to the site. This small
area outside the southern site boundary was surface-inspected in late 2010, but no additional
cultural material was found.
The site is considered to have poor research potential based on the lack of diagnostic artifacts or
features, as well as the disturbances from railroad construction, erosion, and cattle traffic.
Therefore, site 41NL233 is recommended as not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for
designation as an SAL. No further work is required at this site.

Site 41NL234 (Locus 143.6a-1)
Site 41NL234 is a lithic scatter of an unknown prehistoric age found on a slight rise adjacent to a
tributary of Sweetwater Creek. The site covers an area 31-x-25 m (775 m² [102-x-246 ft; 25,092
ft²]) in size within the project corridor, but likely extends eastward outside the project right-of­
way (Figure 59; Figure C11). Vegetation at the site consists of sparse grasses and mesquite trees.
Contextual integrity is poor. Severe erosion was noted in the northern part of the site and
moderate erosion in the central part, in addition to disturbances from bioturbation, cattle
trampling, and a two-track road crossing southern end of the site. Shovel tests showing silty loam
encountered bedrock at generally less than 50 cmbs.
A surface scatter of Edwards chert flakes and cores, interspersed with naturally occurring
Edwards chert cobbles, was noted on the surface. The presence of these cobbles suggests that this
was a lithic procurement site. Six of the 11 shovel tests excavated at the site contained cultural
materials from 0–40 cmbs (Table 31). The artifacts recovered through shovel testing consist of
five edge-modified flakes or shatter of Edwards chert (n=3) and translucent chert (n=2), an
Edwards chert core, and five pieces of Edwards chert unmodified debitage.

The site cannot be fully evaluated because the portions outside of the project corridor have not
been investigated, and therefore site 41NL234 is recommended as being of unknown eligibility
for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as an SAL. However, the portion of the site within
the project corridor is considered to have little remaining research potential based on the poor
contextual integrity and the lack of any features or diagnostic artifacts and would not contribute
to the site’s eligibility if site 41NL234 were later determined eligible for the NRHP. No further
work is recommended for the portion of site 41NL234 within the project right-of-way.

Site 41NL235 (Locus 143.6a-2)
Site 41NL235 is a lithic scatter associated with an undetermined prehistoric period found on a
sloping upland surface overlooking a first-order tributary of Sweetwater Creek. Shovel testing
indicated that the site occupies an area 35-x-5 m (175 m² [115-x-16 ft; 1,840 ft²]) in size within
the project corridor, but likely extends beyond the project area to the west (see Figure C11).
Vegetation at the site consists of tall grasses and a scatter of locust trees. Disturbances noted at
the site include animal burrowing, grazing, and possibly plowing, giving the site fair to good
contextual integrity. Sandy or silty loam extended to approximately 80 cmbs except at the
northern end of the site where bedrock was encountered at less than 30–35 cmbs.
Due to poor ground surface visibility, the site was defined entirely through shovel testing. Six of
the 17 shovel tests excavated at the site vicinity contained cultural materials (a single piece of
shatter on the surface of ST N1000 E1005 was not collected; no subsurface material was found in
this shovel test). Recovered subsurface material consists of two Edwards chert edge-modified
flakes and 25 pieces of unmodified debitage of Edwards chert (n=21) and translucent chert (n=4).
This material was collected from 0–80 cmbs (Table 32). Large quantities of gravels—
constituting 30 percent of the total volume above 50 cm and 15 percent below 50 cm—were also
noted in the shovel tests.

Although the site has fair to good contextual integrity and contains subsurface deposits, the
portion of the site within the project right-of-way is considered to have little remaining research
potential based on the lack of any features or diagnostic artifacts. However, the site cannot be
fully evaluated because the portion outside of the project corridor has not been investigated.
Therefore, the site is recommended as being of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP or
for designation as an SAL. The portion of the site within the corridor would not contribute to the
site eligibility if site 41NL235 were later determined eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, and thus
no further work is recommended for site 41NL235 within the project right-of-way.

Site 41NL236 (Locus 143.6a-3/4)
Site 41NL236 is a lithic scatter occupied during an undetermined prehistoric period on a nearly
level upland surface. The site occupies an area of 460-x-50 m (23,000 m2 [1509-x-164; 247,476
ft2]) in size within the project corridor; however, the site may extend beyond the project right-of­
121

way (Figure 60; see Figure C11). Vegetation noted includes thick grasses, mesquite, juniper, and
mixed hardwoods. Erosion has had a significant impact upon the site, based on run-off and
washouts observed in the site area. Other disturbances were bioturbation, cattle trampling, a twotrack road crossing the southern end of the site, a barbed wire fence, and a fenced enclosure.
These disturbances contribute to its poor contextual integrity. Silty loam generally extended to
80 cmbs, although bedrock was found at roughly 30 cmbs in some areas.
A surface scatter containing chert flakes, shatter, cores, and an arrow point preform was observed
at the site. Of the 59 shovel tests excavated within the site boundary, 21 contained cultural
deposits from 0–80 cmbs (Table 33). Collected subsurface material consists predominantly of
unmodified debitage (Edwards chert, n=28; translucent chert, n=3), although one Edwards chert
core, four edge-modified flakes (three of Edwards chert and one of translucent chert), and two
marginally modified unifaces of Edwards chert were also recovered. In addition to the subsurface
material, the small, thick Edwards chert arrow point preform from the surface was collected,
suggesting a Late Prehistoric affiliation. Chert cobbles and nodules are present upslope from the
site, raising the possibility that the artifacts found were redeposited by agricultural use of the
land.
The portion of the site within the project corridor is considered to have limited research potential
based on the poor contextual integrity and lack of diagnostic artifacts and features, although a
small arrow point preform was found that suggests a Late Prehistoric affiliation. Since site
41NL236 extends outside the current project corridor, it has not been fully assessed and is
recommended as of unknown eligibility for NRHP inclusion or for SAL designation.
Nonetheless, the site portion within the corridor would not contribute to the site’s significance if
it were later determined eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. No further work at site 41NL236
within the project corridor is required.

Site 41NL237 (Locus 143.112a-1)
Site 41NL237 is a lithic scatter dating to an undetermined prehistoric period found at the
confluence of Sweetwater Creek and a first-order tributary. The site measures 70-x-40 m (2,800
m2 [230-x-131 ft; 30,130 ft2]) in size (Figure 61; see Figure C11) and appears to be contained
within the project right-of-way. Dense vegetation consisting of grasses, yucca, thorn bushes,
cacti, and mesquite was found at the site. The site appears to have fair contextual integrity, with
disturbances consisting of limited erosion and a pipeline right-of-way immediately east of the
site. Clay loam extended to roughly 30–35 cmbs before encountering clay.
The site was defined by a diffuse surface scatter of secondary, tertiary, and core flakes. Five
shovel tests were excavated in the site vicinity, but none contained cultural deposits and no
surface artifacts were collected.
Although the site has fair contextual integrity, it is considered to have little remaining research
potential due to the low artifact density, the lack of any diagnostic artifacts, and the absence of
any cultural features. Consequently, site 41NL237 is recommended as not eligible for inclusion
in the NRHP or for designation as an SAL, and no further work is required at this site.

Site 41NL238 (Locus 143.112c-1)
Site 41NL238 is lithic scatter belonging to an undetermined prehistoric period located along a
gently sloping upland surface. The site measures approximately 180-x-50 m (9,000 m2 [590-x­
164 ft; 96,760 ft2]) in size within the project corridor (Figure 62; see Figure C11), though it likely
extends beyond the project area. The thick vegetation consisted of grasses, weeds, mesquite,
yucca, cacti, juniper, and thorn bushes. Ground surface visibility varied from 0–30 percent.
Despite disturbances north of the project corridor from erosion, a two-track, and a pipeline
corridor, some deep subsurface soil deposits (50–80 cmbs) were noted at the site.

125

The site was identified through a surface scatter as well as through shovel testing. Artifacts
observed on the surface included a dense scatter of primary, secondary, and tertiary flakes, core
flakes, cores, and cobbles of Edwards chert varieties. Three of the 15 shovel tests excavated
within the site boundary contained cultural materials from 0–80 cmbs (Table 34). Six subsurface
artifacts were recovered:
a cobble of Edwards chert likely used as a multipurpose
ground/battered stone tool exhibiting several large flake scars on two faces, significant battering
on an opposite edge, and a possible smoothed face (mano?) adjacent to the battered edge; four
pieces of Edwards chert unmodified debitage; and a burned translucent chert cobble fragment.
The ground stone and the burned rock came from the lowest two levels in ST R1.

The site, which almost certainly extends beyond the project corridor and thus has not been fully
investigated, is considered to have fair contextual integrity despite the disturbances north of the
site and to have fair to good research potential based on the possibility for deep, intact cultural
deposits as illustrated by the recovery of artifacts at 70–80 cmbs. Consequently, site 41NL238 is
recommended as being of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as an
SAL. If possible, the power line should avoid placing towers or undertaking future grounddisturbing activities within the 41NL238 boundary. If this is not possible, additional
investigations are recommended for the site within the right-of-way.

Site 41NL239 (Locus 144.3c-1)
Site 41NL239 is a lithic scatter occupied during an undetermined prehistoric period and is located
on a sloping upland surface. The site covers an area of 90-x-50 m (4,500 m² [295-x-164 ft;
48,380 ft²]) within the project corridor, but probably extends beyond the project right-of-way
(Figure 63; Figure C12). Vegetation at the site consists of sparse grasses, cacti, mesquite, and
juniper. The site appears to have poor to fair contextual integrity due to erosion, a two-track road,
and a pipeline right-of-way immediately north of the site. Relatively shallow clay loam soils (less
than roughly 40 cm) contained caliche.
Many Edwards chert cobbles were visible on the surface, and a moderately dense scatter of lithic
debitage and tested cobbles was noted among the natural cobbles. None of the nine shovel tests
excavated onsite contained cultural material, and no material was collected.

128

The portion of site 41NL239 within the project corridor is considered to have limited research
potential due to the disturbances noted, the lack of diagnostic artifacts, and limited cultural
material. However, site 41NL239 is recommended as of unknown NRHP eligibility or for SAL
designation since the site extends beyond the right-of-way and has not been fully assessed.
Nonetheless, the portion of the site within the corridor would not contribute to the site’s eligibility
if later determined eligible for the NRHP. Therefore, no further work is recommended for site
41NL239 within the right-of-way.

Site 41NL240 (Locus 144.3c-2)
Site 41NL240 is a lithic scatter occupied during an unknown prehistoric period. The site is on a
sloping upland surface at the base of a mesa and is crossed by a first-order tributary of Bitter
Creek. The site measures 330-x-50 m (16,500 m² [1,082-x-164 ft; 177,448 ft²]) in size within the
project corridor, but likely extends beyond of the project right-of-way (Figure 64; see Figure
C12). Vegetation at the site includes grasses and juniper. The site has poor contextual integrity
due to erosion and the construction of agricultural terraces. Silty loam deposits, with much
degraded bedrock, caliche, or gravels in shovel tests, encountered bedrock from 5–40 cmbs. In
addition, piles of mesquite removed through chaining are also present.
The site was defined through a surface scatter; the 24 shovel tests excavated within the site
boundary were sterile. The artifacts were all found in a surface context and consisted of flakes,
edge-modified flakes, shatter, cores, and tested cobbles of varieties of Edwards chert. Many of
these artifacts were found on top of the agricultural terraces. Given the geomorphic context of
the site, it may represent materials colluvially redeposited from the mesa. No artifacts were
collected.
The portion of the site within the project corridor is considered to have little or no remaining
research potential due to the poor contextual integrity and the lack of diagnostic artifacts or
features. Nonetheless, site 41NL240 has not been fully assessed since it extends beyond the
current project right-of-way, so it is recommended as of unknown NRHP eligibility or for SAL
designation. However, the portion of the site within the right-of-way would not contribute to the
site’s NRHP eligibility if it were later determined eligible, and therefore, no further work is
required at site 41NL240 within the right-of-way.

Site 41NL241 (Locus 144b-1)

Archaeological Investigations
Site 41NL241 is predominantly a lithic scatter dating to an undetermined prehistoric period, with
a very minimal historic component. It was found on sloping upland surface overlooking a
second-order tributary of Bitter Creek, west of the intersection of CR 220 and CR 245. The site
covers an area of approximately 245-x-50 m (12,250 m² [804-x-164 ft; 131,856 ft²]) within the
corridor and likely extends beyond the project right-of-way (Figure 65; see Figure C12).
Extremely thick vegetation along the ravine adjacent to the southern side of the right-of-way
limited observations beyond the project corridor. Site vegetation consists of thick growths of
cacti, yucca, juniper, mixed hardwoods, briers, and tall grasses. The site area appears to have
130

poor contextual integrity based on impacts from pipeline construction north of the site and the
ravine south of the site. Silty loam soil deposits, some with caliche, extended from 20–80 cmbs
across the site.
The site was identified through a surface lithic scatter. Flakes and burned rock were found along
the north side of the right-of-way and within the adjacent disturbed pipeline corridor to the north.
An edge-modified flake was noted (not collected) in a surface context. The ravine south of the
site contained a modern dump of wood, metal pipe, tile, chicken wire, barbed wire, brick, and
machine parts.
Only one of the 12 shovel tests excavated within the site boundary yielded cultural material. The
one positive shovel test contained historic materials (0–20 cmbs) likely associated with the dump
on the southern edge of the site (Table 35). The shovel test yielded one piece of window glass as
well as 12 fragments of Domestic glass—two amber/brown bottle bases (one with a stippled base
with an Owens ring and embossed with “III/W/82” [post-1946; Toulouse 1971:327]; and the
other with the base embossed with “W” in a circle and a “Type 3” maker’s mark representing the
T. C. Wheaton Co. [post-1946; Toulouse 1971:327]); ash tint fragments of three body sherds and
one bottle base embossed with a partial “I” within “O” Owens-Illinois maker’s mark and “2”
(post-1954; Toulouse 1971:403); and four clear (post-1880; Kendrick 1971) and two light tint
body sherds—and a Domestic probable fruit jar lid of zinc. These materials generally indicate the
twentieth century.

Archival Research
Site 41NL241 is located on Section 51, Block 21, of the Texas and Pacific Railroad surveys of
Nolan County, Texas. Archival research revealed that a patent to the property was issued 1876 to
the Fidelity Insurance, Trust and Safe Deposit Company (GLO 2011). Deed title research
conducted at the Nolan County Clerk’s Office traced the ownership of the property back to 1893.
Between 1876 and 1893, the property was granted to the Weis Plow Company, who in 1893 sold
the property to William Hanna (NCC 1893:DB I:603). In 1903, Sarah Hanna (widow of William
Hanna), Mary Bereton, William Bereton, and J. Ross Hanna sold the property to Mouse Wood,
who later in that same year sold the property to T. S. Rounsaville (NCC 1903:DB P:250; NCC
1903:DB P:287). T. S. Rounsaville and his wife Mary Rounsaville maintained ownership of the
property until 1939, at which time they sold the property R. L. McReynolds (NCC 1906:DB
51:353). Between 1906 and 1939, R. L. McReynolds died and the property was transferred to his
wife Lillie McReynolds (NCC 1939:Oil and Gas Release [OGR] 23:355), and between 1939 and
1959, Lillian McReynolds died and the property was transferred to her heirs G. W. McReynolds,
134

F. D. Wyatt, Jane McReynolds Wyatt, Eilene McReynolds Caves, and James Caves, who in 1959
granted the property to the current owner J. T. McReynolds (NCC 1959:DB 174:35; NCC
1959:DB 174:36; NCC 1959:DB 174:496).

Summary
The portion of site 41NL241 within the project corridor is considered to have little to no
remaining research potential based on the poor contextual integrity, together with the lack of
subsurface deposits, features, and diagnostic artifacts. Archival investigations failed to reveal
data pertinent to NRHP Criteria a–d (36 CFR Part 60.4 [a-d]) or to SAL designation criteria (Title
9, Chapter 191). Because site 41NL241 extends beyond the current project right-of-way and was
not fully assessed, however, it is recommended as of unknown eligibility for NRHP inclusion or
for SAL designation. Nonetheless, this portion of the site within the right-of-way would not
contribute to its eligibility in the future. Therefore, no further work is needed at site 41NL241
within the corridor.

Site 41NL242 (Locus 145a-1—Revisited
Site 41NL242 is a lithic scatter dating to an undetermined prehistoric period. It was found on a
gently sloping upland adjacent to a second-order tributary of Bitter Creek. The site measured
165-x-50 (8,250 m² [538-x-164 ft; 88,232 ft²]) within the project corridor, but extended beyond
the project right-of-way (Figure 66; see Figure C12). Vegetation at the site consists of dense
grasses, cacti, juniper, and locust, allowing only 30 to 40 percent ground surface visibility.
Disturbances noted in the site area were a pipeline right-of-way to the north, animal burrows, and
cattle trampling, giving the site poor to fair contextual integrity.
Since neither subsurface investigation nor artifact collection was permitted by the landowner, the
site was initially defined entirely by the surface scatter. Artifacts observed on the surface
included a low-density scatter of chert flakes, cores, and burned rock. No diagnostic artifacts
were noted. The artifact scatter extended north of the project right-of-way and possibly to the
south.
The site was considered to have an unknown research potential due to the inability to conduct
subsurface investigation at the site, though it was anticipated that the site would have little
research potential based on the contextual integrity, low artifact density, and lack of diagnostic
artifacts or features.
After the project corridor had been acquired, shovel testing was conducted on December 14,
2010. A slight shift in the corridor moved the corridor approximately 5 m (16 ft) to the north.
Since the site was situated in an area considered as high probability, the entire property was
surveyed at 30-m intervals and shovel tests were excavated on the site to delimit the boundary. A
total of 17 shovel tests was excavated in the vicinity of the original plotted location of the site.
All but one shovel test, located toward the eastern end of the site, were negative for cultural
materials. The one positive shovel test contained only one small Edwards chert flake (Table 36).
The interpretation was that the cultural materials within the project corridor appear to be largely
the result of erosion from the chert-rich uplands to the south of the project area. Because of the
slight reroute shift and the surface scatter, the site size within the project area was increased
minimally to 165-x-55 (9,075 m² [538-x-180 ft; 96,840 ft²]).

The portion of site 41NL242 within the project corridor is considered to have little research
potential based on the lack of contextual integrity, low artifact density, and lack of diagnostic
artifacts or features. However, the site is considered to be of unknown eligibility for NRHP
inclusion or for SAL designation because the site extends beyond the project right-of-way.
Nonetheless, this portion of site 41NL242 within the right-of-way would not contribute to the
significance of the site if later determined NRHP eligible. Therefore, no further work is required
at site 41NL242 within the right-of-way.

Site 41NL243 (Locus 145a-2)—Reroute and Tested

Original Oncor Corridor Survey
Site 41NL243 is a lithic scatter associated with an unknown prehistoric period found on a nearly
level surface between Bitter Creek and a second-order tributary to the west. The site measures
116-x-50 m (5,800 m² [380-x-164 ft; 32,320 ft²]) within the project right-of-way but extends
beyond the project corridor (Figure 67; see Figure C13). Vegetation at the site includes grasses,
scrub woods (which include juniper and locust), and cacti. The site appears to have fair
contextual integrity, but disturbances from erosion, construction of agricultural terraces, animal
burrows, and cattle trampling were noted. The site has also been significantly disturbed by a
buried pipeline located immediately north of the project corridor.
The site was defined entirely through a surface scatter since subsurface investigations were not
allowed on this property; however, the soils exposed in an erosional feature suggest that intact
subsurface soil deposits are present. The landowner allowed no cultural material to be collected
from this site, but the dense surface scatter included Edwards chert flakes, cores, scrapers,
bifaces, burned rock, and ground stone fragments. Although dispersed, the burned rock suggests
that hearths or similar features are present.
At the conclusion of the pedestrian survey, the site was considered to have an unknown research
potential due to the inability to perform subsurface investigations and because it extends outside
the current project corridor. However, the density and variety of artifacts observed and the
topographic location suggested that the site may have served as a campsite. Site 41NL243 was
recommended as being of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP. It was recommended
that construction should be avoided within the site area given the possibility for intact cultural
materials within the project corridor. If avoidance was not possible, additional investigations
(such as monitoring) were recommended within the right-of-way at site 41NL243.
137

Reroute Corridor Investigations
After Oncor formally acquired ownership of the right-of-way easement and the reroute corridor
was established (shifting the project corridor approximately 5 m [16 ft] south), a shovel test
inventory was conducted on 14 December 2010. By that time, Oncor had hand-cleared about a
15-m-wide (49 ft) path through the right-of-way and site, and large brush piles had been pushed
with rubber-tired vehicles onto both sides of the cleared corridor (Figure 68). The site was still
identified by the presence of burned rock and chipped stone debris on the surface within both the
cleared corridor and outside of the cleared area. Two low-profile agricultural terraces oriented
roughly north–south intersected the site on both the central portion and western edge.
The shovel test inventory proceeded through the site area in 30-m intervals. This resulted in 10
total positive shovel tests on the northern and the southern transects. Radiating from the easternand westernmost positive shovel tests was a total of 12 delineation shovel tests. Thirteen of the
excavated shovel tests were positive. The shovel tests excavated onsite at 41NL243 largely
confirmed the boundary of the initial site area. Additional negative shovel tests placed off the
western edge of the site and on the sloping ground on the east edge of the site proximal to the
Bitter Creek channel further defined limits (see Figure 68). Silty loam in the shovel tests (many
with caliche and gravels) extended from 30–80 cmbs across the site.
The site lithic assemblage of Edwards chert consists primarily of unmodified debitage (six flake
fragments, 10 pieces of shatter, and tertiary [n=9] flakes with several specimens of primary [n=1]
and secondary [n=3] flakes (Table 37 [note: three additional flakes from ST R20, 0–10, lost in
the field are not included on the database or Table 37]). Three pieces of FCR were also collected.
Among the artifacts identified at the site was a single deer tooth found in ST R19 at the southern
edge of the site. The deer molar was recovered between 30 and 50 cmbs, clearly below the
plowzone at the site. The tooth was nearly intact and showed extreme wear, likely to the gum
line, indicating that the deer was probably quite old when it died. Within the same shovel of soil,
two fragments of lithic debitage were also recovered. This lent to the interpretation that the
faunal element might be archaeological in nature and the site might have potential for yielding
data pertaining to prehistoric subsistence practices.

NRHP Testing
The erection of a transmission tower was planned for the center of site 41NL243. An impact area
of approximately 49 m N/S by 91 m E/W (4,459 m2; 160 ft N/S by 300 ft E/W; 48,000 ft2]) was
identified around the tower location to delimit the potential area of disturbance related to the
tower construction. Accordingly, initial site testing activities (December 15–20, 2010) were
concentrated within this impact area. Fifteen test units were planned within the impact area (see
Figure 68). All cultural material identified during this phase of work was returned to the
landowner at the conclusion of infield analysis. The site testing was initiated with extensive field
mapping of surface scatters.
The only surface tool identified during mapping was a corner-tang biface fragment (photographed
only; not collected or included in database) found on the general surface within the project
boundary near the northwest corner of the impact zone (Figure 69). The artifact represents a
relatively rare biface mainly found in Central Texas and along the Balcones Escarpment and dates
to the Late Archaic period (Turner and Hester 1999).
139

Test Units 1–7
Subsequent to field mapping, the excavation of four 50-x-50-cm test units (TUs 1–4), one in each
quadrant of the impact area, was undertaken. Additionally, a 1-x-3-m block of three test units
(TUs 5–7) was excavated near the central portion of the site in a dense concentration of burned
rock and debitage.
The results from excavation of the 50-x-50-cm units indicated that the artifact density and depth
was quite variable across the site (Table 38). Within TU 1, the majority of the artifacts (including
an edge-modified flake, 10–20 cmbs) were recovered from within the plowzone, identified within
the upper 25–30 cm. Clearly below the plowzone was a projectile point base recovered from the
30–40-cm level (Figure 70). The raw material for the point (FS 299/1) is a tan Edwards chert.
The fragment exhibits a slightly flaring and pronounced stem. The base is slightly convex and
the two tangs have obviously been snapped. The medial and distal portions of the specimen are
missing, but a portion of one shoulder appears to have been reworked. Notching at the distal
edge, near the snap fracture suggests that the point was reworked to form a drill. The base most
closely resembles the Marcos type (Turner and Hester 1999), indicative of the Late to
Transitional Archaic periods, but due to the similarity in other point morphologies, it could have
also been manufactured during the Middle Archaic.
Interestingly, TU 1 yielded the most artifacts at the site during this visit. How much of the upper
portion of site has been reworked due to plowing and landscape modification (agricultural
terracing) is presently unknown since discernable in situ subsurface features have not been
identified. It is clear, however, that some portion of the site extends into the undisturbed
subsurface to an average depth of approximately 50 cm. A notable exception to this is TU 3,
located at the southern end of the site in which a very low density of artifacts was observed to a
depth of at least 1 m. The only other tools recovered from these units were two bifaces, one each
from TUs 2 and 3, both from 20–30 cmbs. Varieties of chert, predominantly Edwards chert, were
identified as the raw materials for the assemblage from the 50-x-50-cm test units.
Based on the density of chipped stone and burned rock on the surface, a 1-x-3-m block of three
test units (TUs 5–7) was excavated in the eastern portion of the impact area. Compared to the
previous test units, this block was positioned closer to the centerline of the right-of-way. Overall,
the soil was incredibly compact and the profile was slightly redder in hue (5YR 4/6) in these
units,compared to the dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) color observed elsewhere on the site. The results
in this area indicated that the vast majority of the artifacts were concentrated within the plowzone
(upper 25–30 cmbs) (Table 39). A variable density was also noted in this location, with only 30
artifacts recovered from TU 5, compared to the 100+ artifacts recovered from each of the other
two adjacent test units. Small chunks of charcoal were observed in some of the units.
The only potential feature identified during this visit to the site was located on the extreme
northwestern edge of TU 5. In this area, a dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) soil stain was observed
that contrasted with the surrounding yellowish red (5YR 4/6) matrix. The stain was closely
inspected with a trowel and excavated/screened separately from the remaining unit to determine if
this was a cultural feature. Only one flake (from the feature fill), and charcoal was identified
within the stain, and it was documented as an amorphous stain that was only approximately 10
cm thick. The stain did appear to continue into the west wall and was clearly truncated by the
plowzone. This stain was interpreted as rodent disturbance.

70. Late to Transitional Archaic Marcos-like projectile point reworked for probable use as a drill
(FS 299/1), recovered from TU 1, site 41NL243

Figure 70. Late to Transitional Archaic Marcos-like projectile point reworked for probable use as a drill (FS 299/1),
recovered from TU 1, site 41NL243.

TUs 6 and 7 yielded the three lithic tools in this block. A small medial fragment of a finely
worked but untyped arrow point and an edge-modified flake with shallow notching were found in
TU 6 from 20–30 cmbs; both tools are of Edwards chert. A large scraper formed on a bulbous
secondary flake of Edwards chert was recovered from TU 7 (0–10 cmbs). The majority of the
assemblage from the site was unmodified debitage, and the dominant raw material was Edwards
chert (96 percent).
TU 6 yielded the only other interesting diagnostic artifacts found: two small pieces of pottery,
one possibly incised (Figure 71). The ceramics are small body sherds with grit temper. The
incising is a shallow line on the body exterior. These pieces were found between 10 and 20 cmbs,
well within the plowzone.

Test Units 8–15
In February 2011, additional NRHP testing was conducted at site 41NL243 to continue to search
for datable materials and in situ subsurface cultural features (no artifacts were removed from the
field at the request of the landowner, but cultural materials were analyzed in the field using the
same detailed criteria that Geo-Marine used throughout this entire project).
Additional test units (TUs 8–15—seven 1-x-1 m and one 1-x-0.5 m [TU 11]) were excavated
within the previously identified site boundary (see Figure 68). The majority of the test units were
excavated adjacent to the most productive areas identified during previous excavations, but some
test units were excavated in areas not previously investigated to gain a better understanding of
artifact densities and soil profiles across the site. The results of this testing phase generally
confirmed the previous interpretations that the majority of artifacts are within a disturbed context
145

resulting from historic and modern modification of the landscape for the construction of
agricultural terraces. In fact, 70.7 percent of lithic materials recovered during all subsurface
testing at site 41NL243 were found within the plowzone, which was typically encountered at 20–
30 cmbs (Figure 72). Despite this apparent loss of integrity within the upper cultural zone, a
seemingly intact cultural feature consisting of an FCR cluster associated with a biface and a spike
in debitage counts was encountered between 110 and 130 cmbs in TU 14 excavated near the
southeast boundary of site 41NL243 (see TU 14 description below). This represents the first
clear evidence that intact features are present below the plowzone. Unfortunately, no datable
materials were found in any of the eight additional test units that would allow the occupation
range at site 41NL243 to be more specifically defined, although small chunks of charcoal were
observed in several of the units and collected when possible.

TU 8 (1-x-1 m) was excavated adjacent to ST R19 that yielded the deer tooth and debitage from
sediment below the plowzone during initial shovel testing. The goal was to determine if
additional intact faunal materials were present in the area that could yield data regarding
prehistoric subsistence practices at site 41NL243. The excavation of TU 8 yielded a variety of
artifacts, including varieties of Edwards chert debitage (two primary, 10 secondary. 27 tertiary
flakes), tools (eight chert edge-modified flakes), a complete limestone hammerstone, FCR, and a
charcoal sample (Table 40); however, no additional faunal remains were recovered. The majority
of the artifacts (65 percent) were recovered from within the plowzone, which was identified at
approximately 20 cmbs. Below the plowzone, artifact densities generally decreased with depth
and no discernable pattern was recognizable. The unit was terminated at 90 cmbs after two sterile
levels were encountered.

TU 9 (1-x-1 m) was excavated several meters east of TU 1, the artifactually productive 50-x-50­
cm unit that had yielded a projectile point base and an edge-modified flake blade during initial
testing. Since both lithic tools were recovered from below the plowzone, this area was
considered to have a high probability of containing in situ datable materials. TU 9 did not
produce datable materials, but did yield a high density and wide variety of artifacts, including
more than 300 pieces of chert debitage (298 flakes and six pieces of shatter), 11 chert lithic tools
(two biface fragments [10–20 and 40–50 cmbs] and nine edge-modified flakes), two chert cores
(one exhausted, one complete), 48 pieces of FCR, an animal bone (calcined mammal shaft
fragment), and five mussel shell fragments (Table 41). Unfortunately, approximately 73 percent
of the artifacts were recovered from within the plowzone identified between 0 and 20 cmbs.
Nonetheless, recovered from below the plowzone were 86 pieces of debitage, one biface, one
edge-modified flake, seven FCR, the mammal bone, three mussel shell fragments, and an
observed charcoal fleck. No cultural features were found within or below the plowzone. The unit
was terminated at 80 cmbs after two sterile levels were encountered. The results of TU 9 indicate
that although a significant portion of the archaeological materials are within a disturbed context,
potentially undisturbed materials are present below the plowzone at site 41NL243.
TU 10 (1-x-1 m) was excavated at the top of one of the two north–south-trending agricultural
terraces present within the site boundary. The goal was to determine the degree to which
sediment was scraped from adjacent areas to construct the terraces and to also determine artifact
densities within this disturbed sediment that is clearly less than 100 years old. The excavation
revealed approximately 40 cm of disturbed sediment above the buried natural surface (Figure 73).
Interestingly, 96 percent of the artifacts recovered from TU 10 were found within this disturbed
context (Table 42). Only two pieces of debitage were found below the plowzone, and the unit
was terminated at 70 cmbs after two negative levels were encountered. All recovered material
was of chert and consisted primarily of unmodified debitage, with a single edge-modified flake
and an exhausted core (both from 0–10 cmbs) completing the assemblage. The results of TU 10
indicate that artifacts within the plowzone at site 41NL243 have been translocated laterally as
well as vertically during land-grading activities, as the terrace fill should have been culturally
sterile otherwise.

TU 11 (1-x-.5 m) was excavated at the western boundary of the impact zone, which also
coincides roughly with the western extent of the surface artifact scatter at site 41NL243. This test
unit was excavated at this location to confirm that artifact densities decreased toward the western
end of the site and that additional test units would be most productive toward the eastern portion
of the site. The test unit yielded only four pieces of chert debitage and was terminated at 80 cmbs
after two sterile levels (Table 43). Subsequent to these findings, the remaining test units were
placed in the central and eastern portions of the site.

TU 12 (1-x-1 m) was excavated adjacent to the north sides of TUs 6 and 7, which were the most
artifactually productive units among the 1-x-3-m block originally excavated in the eastcentral
portion of the impact area. Focus was also placed on this area because TU 6 had yielded the two
prehistoric ceramics between 10 and 20 cmbs during initial testing at the site. Interestingly
though, TU 12 yielded only a chert biface fragment and sparse chert secondary and tertiary flake
counts between 0 and 50 cmbs and was terminated at 70 after two sterile levels (Table 44).
TU 13 (1-x-1 m) was excavated at the northeast end of the impact area east of TUs 1 and 9, each
of which had yielded a high density of artifacts. Again, the majority of artifacts from TU 13 was
recovered from within the plowzone, but debitage, a biface, FCR, bone fragments, highly
fragmented mussel shell, and isolated charcoal flecks were recovered from sediment clearly
below the plowzone (Table 45). An animal long bone shaft fragment (broken into three pieces
during excavation) was not identifiable to species, but based on the thickness of the bone, the

specimen could have derived from a deer-sized or bison-sized animal. Primary (n=5), secondary
(n=36), and tertiary (n=113) flakes as well as a blade and a blade fragment comprise the chert
unmodified debitage, and the two cores are tested chert cobbles. The majority of the tertiary
flakes (n=82) were recovered from the upper 10 cmbs. The chert tools consist of four edgemodified flakes (0–10) and six biface/biface fragments. A small spike in artifact counts was
encountered between 30 and 70 cmbs in TU 13 following a sterile level between 20 and 30 cmbs
(see Table 45). However, since no intact cultural features were found in association, it is difficult
to determine whether the spike represents an occupation discrete from the uppermost artifact
cluster within the plowzone or if it simply represents a sampling anomaly.

TU 14 (1-x-1 m) was placed adjacent to a dense scatter of FCR near the southeast boundary of
site 41NL243. Four edge-modified flakes, 179 pieces of debitage, two mussel shell fragments,
and 15 pieces of FCR were recovered from the upper 110 cmbs. The first spike in debitage
counts occurred between 0 and 20 cmbs within the plowzone, and a second spike in debitage
counts was observed in association with a cluster of FCR encountered at more than a meter below
ground surface (Table 46).

* Combined as a single feature level

The top of the cultural feature (Feature 1) was recognized at 110 cmbs and continued to
approximately 130 cmbs and consisted of numerous FCR (n=17) as well as chert debitage (three
primary, 23 secondary, and 123 tertiary flakes), two bifaces, and an edge-modified flake (Figure
74). Eighteen pieces (12.1 percent) of the 149 pieces of debitage recovered from Feature 1 were
determined to have been pot-lidded due to high heat exposure. A single charcoal fleck was
observed between 130 and 140 cm; however, no charcoal was observed between 110 and 130
cmbs. Due to the near absence of charcoal and lack of patterning typical of a hearth, the feature
most likely represents a scatter of disarticulate hearth remnants as opposed to an intact fire pit.
The feature represents the clearest evidence that intact archaeological deposits are in fact present
below the plowzone. Unfortunately, no datable cultural materials were found in association with
the feature. Additionally, since no bedding planes or gravel lenses were observed within the
approximate meter of sediment above the feature, it is difficult to determine the approximate
number and intensity of flood events that eventually buried the feature. This also precludes
establishing a relative age of the cultural materials associated with the feature.

Figure 74. Feature 1 encountered between 110 and 130 cmbs in TU 14, site 41NL243.

TU 15 (1-x-1 m) was excavated approximately 12 m southwest of TU 14 at the south end of a
surface scatter of FCR. Similar to the other test units, most of the artifacts were recovered from
the plowzone—among which was the single tool, an edge-modified flake—although a notable
presence of artifacts extended to approximately a meter below surface (Table 47). Seven
primary, 38 secondary, and 103 tertiary flakes as well as two blades comprised the chert
unmodified debitage assemblage; approximately 85 percent of the tertiary flakes came from the
upper 30 cmbs. Interestingly, no artifacts or cultural features were found between 110 and 130
cmbs, which was the depth range in which Feature 1 was encountered in TU 14, despite the
proximity and soil profile similarities between the two test units. The unit was terminated at 130
cmbs after two negative levels were encountered.

Summary and Recommendation
At the completion of the testing, the site area was increased to approximately 155-x-60 m (9,300
m2 [509-x-197 ft; 100,273 ft2]) to encompass the positive units and the surface scatter. Of the
10.275 m3 of total matrix excavated in the test units at site 41NL243, the average density of
artifacts recovered was roughly 131.4 artifacts per m3. From these investigations, one cultural
feature was encountered and four datable artifacts were recovered. The Late Archaic period
corner-tang biface was found on the ground surface within the project boundary near the
northwest corner of the impact zone (see Figure 69). Second, a projectile point base resembling
the Marcos type (reworked into a probable drill) was recovered clearly below the plowzone in TU
1 during the initial testing phase (see Figure 70). The Marcos type is indicative of the Late to

Transitional Archaic periods; however, due to similarities in other point types, it could have also
been manufactured during the Middle Archaic. Finally, two Late Prehistoric period ceramic body
fragments were found within the plowzone during the initial testing phase in TU 6 (see Figure
71). In sum, site 41NL243 appears to contain occupations from the Late Prehistoric and Late
Archaic periods and possibly the Middle Archaic period. However, whether the datable materials
were recovered from their original depositional context still remains unclear, since each of the
datable materials was found on the surface, or within the plowzone, or in levels without
discernable in situ subsurface features.
The evidence that artifacts within the plowzone have been translocated laterally as well as
vertically due to historic and modern landscape modifications, in addition to the apparent lack of
intact subsurface cultural features within the plowzone, limits the research potential of the
uppermost cultural zone at site 41NL243. Though there is a high density and wide variety of
artifacts and presence of diagnostic materials on the ground surface and within the plowzone at
site 41NL243, this upper part of the site does indicate loss of integrity. The portion of the site
below the plowzone, though much lower in artifact density, does appear to retain some integrity,
and the site limits do extend outside of the present Oncor right-of-way.
Therefore, it is recommended that site 41NL243 retain its status of unknown eligibility for NRHP
inclusion or for designation as an SAL as the site limits extend beyond the project corridor, and
that surface disturbances associated with the Oncor construction activities be minimized. Handclearing of vegetation and the use of rubber-tired vehicles are recommended within the boundary
of site 41NL243 inside the project corridor.

153

Monitoring
Subsequent to eligibility testing at site 41NL243, cultural resources monitoring was conducted on
March 24, 2011, during drilling for the installation of an ONCOR transmission tower within the
site boundary. Monitoring was necessary due to the presence of the intact hearth feature between
110 and 130 cmbs and because Holocene sediments exposed in an adjacent stream cutbank were
found to extend below depths excavated during testing. A monitor was present during drilling for
each of the four tower support piers, which ranged between 15 and 25 feet below the surface, to
ensure that no deeply buried intact features or buried surfaces were present below previously
excavated depths. The sediments expelled during each of the drill increments and the sidewalls
of the drill holes were carefully examined during the drilling process; however, no intact features,
diagnostic materials, or buried surfaces were encountered during monitoring. In short, the results
of the monitoring did not change the previous recommendations of unknown eligibility made for
site 41NL243.

Site 41NL244 (Locus 145.1a-1)—Tested

Original Oncor Corridor Survey
Site 41NL244 is a lithic scatter occupied during an undetermined prehistoric period located on a
nearly level, plowed field adjacent to Bitter Creek (see Figure C14). The site measures 75-x-30
m (2,250 m² [246-x-99 ft; 24,354 ft²]) in size (Figure 75) within the right-of-way but extends
beyond the project corridor. Site vegetation consists of planted corn obscuring 40 percent of the
ground surface. Plowing is the major disturbance noted, but erosion and bioturbation have also
had a minimal impact upon the site. The site appears to have fair to good contextual integrity
because all shovel tests revealed clay loam to a depth of 80 cmbs.
The site was defined through the surface scatter since none of the seven shovel tests within the
site boundary contained cultural deposits. The surface scatter consisted of Edwards chert cores,
flakes, three bifaces, edge-modified flakes, and possible burned rock. The three biface fragments
were collected (Figure 76): two late aborted (FS 167/4; and FS 167/6, a large proximal fragment
of a thinned biface, likely abandoned because of a step fracture on one face near a lateral edge)
and a small fragment from a possible thinned knife (FS 167/5), all of Edwards chert (Table 48).
Two edge-modified chert flakes and a chert exhausted core as well as a highly weathered, burned
quartzite rock were also collected.
The site was considered to retain a moderate research potential based on its geomorphic location
and the variety of artifact types observed. Additionally, the site could not be fully assessed since
it extended beyond the project corridor. Consequently, site 41NL244 was recommended as being
of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP. Avoidance of the site area was recommended.
If avoidance was not possible, further investigations within the right-of-way at site 41NL244
would be required at the potential tower locations.

NRHP Testing
Subsequent to the initial discovery of site 41NL244, construction of a transmission tower on the
western edge of this site was planned by Oncor, and the project corridor was shifted slightly to
the south by roughly 5 m. This small area was visually inspected, but no additional cultural
materials were noted. Since the site is situated on the western edge of a wide terrace, the impact
156

area designated for this tower is positioned eastward from the tower. Consequently, the entire
site, as initially defined, will be affected by construction. Accordingly, the site was designated
for test excavations because of its unknown eligibility. These investigations were carried out in
mid-December 2010 and one day each in January and February 2011.
The site area was entirely encompassed by the designated impact area, which stretched from the
northern edge of the original corridor to a new southern corridor boundary after the small route
adjustment was made (see Figure 75). The Principle Investigator made the determination that the
site should be explored by several 1-x-2-m test units. A surface survey was conducted over the
site, but no artifacts were visible on the surface of the plowed field. Consequently, investigations
proceeded by first establishing a 1-x-1-m unit in the northwestern part of the site (TU 1). Two
other 1-x-1-m units were established: TU 2 near the center of the site and TU 4 in the
northeastern part. After an arbitrary 80 cm was excavated from each test unit, a decision was
made regarding which units to expand into 1-x-2-m units. Given that TU 2, located near the
center of the site, was the least productive and with extensive disturbance noted in the unit, the
western (TU 1) and eastern (TU 4) units were expanded into blocks by adding TUs 3 and 5, and
TUs 6 and 7 were excavated along the eastern impact area boundary and in the southwestern
portion, respectively. Because the impact area covered the entire corridor and because of the lack
of surface material compared to the quantity of subsurface artifacts, an additional test unit (TU 8)
was subsequently excavated on the previously identified site boundary to more accurately
determine the actual limits of the site within the project boundary.
Across the site, the soil profile observed was quite uniform. The plowzone was observed
consistently between 30 and 40 cmbs. The lower boundary of this horizon was often abrupt and
wavy across the test units. Below this zone was a moist brown (7.5YR 4/3–4/4) silt loam subsoil
that increased in compaction with depth. In most test units, faint carbonate threads were noted,
but none were in abundance. The artifact density across the site in general appeared to be slightly
clustered between 40 and 70 cmbs. Several very small fragments of mussel shell (near 0.25 inch)
were occasionally observed within the units.
In Block 1 (TUs 1 and 3), a thin gravel lens was noted between 100 and 110 cmbs. This lens was
the only evidence that more than one flood event could have caused the sedimentation across the
site area. Three fragments of debitage were identified at the bottom of and below this gravel lens
(Table 49), which could suggest that the site had been occupied during multiple discernable
periods. Given that the overlying gravel lens appeared to be undisturbed from bioturbation, it is
doubtful that these fragments of debitage were translocated downward through the soil profile.
The 104 pieces of lithic debitage were composed primarily of secondary (n=22) and tertiary
(n=48) flakes (67 percent), with primary flakes (n=2), flake fragments (n=17), and shatter (n=22)
also collected. Edwards chert (n=70; 67 percent) was the predominant raw material, with lesser
amounts of translucent chert (n=33; 32 percent) and fossiliferous chert (n=1; 0.01 percent) among
the debitage. Although one Edwards chert late aborted biface fragment was found, unfortunately,
no diagnostic artifacts or datable materials were recovered from the test units in Block 1.
Additionally, nine mussel shell fragments were recovered between 50 and 80 cmbs, and a single
unworked deer tooth fragment was recovered from 30–40 cmbs (TU 3).

TU 2 was located near the center of the site on the side slope of an agricultural berm that
generally marked the southern boundary of the site. The soil profile was similar to that observed
elsewhere, with the exception that no distinct stratigraphic breaks were identified. Also similar to
elsewhere at the site, the highest artifact density appeared to be clustered between 60 and 70 cmbs
(Table 50). Primary (n=1), secondary (n=6), and tertiary (n=10) flakes, a biface thinning flake, a
blade fragment, and flake fragments (n=21) as well as shatter (n=2) were primarily of Edwards
chert (n=22, 52 percent) and translucent chert (n=19, 45 percent), with fossiliferous chert (n=1,
0.02 percent) minimally represented. The western half of the unit, within the levels between 30
and 70 cm, contained extensive disturbance from a large decaying root. This natural feature was
observed as an amorphous dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) stain that appeared immediately below the
plowzone. No artifacts were observed in association with the stain, and a piece of severely
decaying root was observed in the center of the stain at 60 cmbs. The stain was excavated
separately from the rest of the unit, and no artifacts or charcoal were observed in association with
the root. Given the disturbance observed in the test unit, the remainder of the excavations were
focused elsewhere at the site.
Block 2 (TUs 4 and 5) was located in the northeastern part of the site. Similar to elsewhere, the
artifact concentration within the block appeared to cluster both in the plowzone and between 50
and 80 cmbs (Table 51). As typical of the site, secondary and tertiary flakes combined (n=50, 57
percent) made up the majority of the debitage, with a single primary flake collected from 70–80
cmbs; in the block, however, translucent chert (56 percent) comprised the predominant raw
material, followed by Edwards chert (43 percent) and minimal fossiliferous chert (0.01 percent) .
In this block, several charcoal flecks that were too small to be collected were also observed. No
diagnostic materials were identified, and the site density appeared to be consistent with elsewhere
at the site.

At the conclusion of the excavation of these first five test units, one puzzling observance was
made about the site: No artifacts were visible on the surface, even though the site had been
identified only as a surface scatter. Instead, several fragments of debitage and a low density of
FCR were observed in the upper 40-cm-thick plowzone, and a slightly higher concentration of
artifacts was observed within the subsoil between 60 and 70 cmbs. To determine whether the site
boundary had been correctly delineated based on the surface survey, a final test unit was placed
159

off the eastern edge of the site (Table 52). TU 6 contained a soil profile similar to that observed
elsewhere. The unit yielded secondary and tertiary flakes (n=6) and flake fragments (n=10) of
Edwards chert (38 percent) and translucent chert (62 percent). Certainly, the artifact density was
lower than that observed within the previously mapped site boundary; but given that the unit was
not sterile, it was determined that additional work needed to be completed to accurately identify
the limits of site 41NL244.

Therefore, two additional 1-x-1-m test units (TUs 7 and 8) were subsequently excavated at site
41NL244 in February 2011. The units were excavated near the previously identified site
boundary to more accurately determine the limits of the site within the project boundary and to
search for datable materials and in situ cultural features.
TU 7 was excavated south of the proposed Oncor tower location in the southwest portion of the
impact area. The majority of artifacts recovered from TU 7 were recovered from the plowzone,
which was identified at approximately 35 cmbs (Table 53). Sparse debitage counts with no
discernable pattern were encountered below the plowzone. Debitage was composed of secondary
and tertiary flakes (n=15), a biface thinning flake, a blade, flake fragments (n=27), and shatter
(n=10) of equal amounts of chert and translucent chert. The unit did yield an Edwards chert core
fragment (30–40 cmbs), a chert edge-modified flake between 50 and 60 cmbs and another chert
edge-modified flake between 110 and 120 cmbs, as well as a limestone hammerstone between 90
and 100 cmbs; however, no diagnostic materials or cultural features were found in association.
TU 7 was terminated at 140 cmbs after two negative levels were encountered.
TU 8 was excavated in the southeast portion of the impact area because no test units had been
previously excavated there. The unit yielded a total of 14 pieces of debitage and one small
mussel shell fragment (Table 54). Tertiary and biface thinning flakes (n=8), flake fragments
(n=5), and shatter (n=1) comprised the debitage assemblage, with chert representing 93 percent of
the raw material. Again, no pattern was recognized in the subsurface artifact distribution, and the
unit was terminated at 120 cmbs after two sterile levels were encountered.

Although counts were sparse, the presence of artifacts in TUs 7 and 8 confirmed that site
41NL243 extends throughout the Oncor right-of-way.
161

Summary and Recommendations
The testing investigations expanded the site to approximately 78-x-55 m (4,209 m2; 256-x-180 ft
[46,080 ft2]) within the corridor, but the site still likely extends beyond the project impact area
and corridor. Of the 9.3 m3 of matrix excavated at site 41NL244, the average density of artifacts
observed was roughly 27.2 artifacts per m3. As discussed previously, the density of artifacts was
relatively consistent across the site, and a subsurface component clustered near 70 cmbs was
typically recognized. It is unfortunate that no datable materials, in situ cultural features, or
diagnostic artifacts have been recovered from the excavations. As a result, the portion of site
41NL244 within the project area likely would not contribute to a recommendation of eligible if
the site were later so determined. However, since the site extends beyond the project corridor,
site 41NL244 is recommended as of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP or for
designation as an SAL.
Monitoring
Subsequent to eligibility testing at site 41NL244, cultural resources monitoring was conducted on
March 23, 2011, during drilling for the installation of an ONCOR transmission tower within the
site boundary. Monitoring was necessary because Holocene sediments were found to extend
below depths excavated during testing. A monitor was present during drilling for each of the four
tower support piers, which ranged between 15 and 25 feet below the surface, to ensure that no
deeply buried intact features or buried surfaces were present below previously excavated depths.
The sediments expelled during each of the drill increments and the sidewalls of the drill holes
were carefully examined during the drilling process; however, no intact features, diagnostic
materials, or buried surfaces were encountered during monitoring. In short, the results of the
monitoring did not change the previous recommendations of unknown eligibility made for site
41NL244.
Site 41NL245 (Locus 145.1a-3)
Site 41NL245 is a lithic scatter dating to an undetermined prehistoric period. It is located on a
gently sloping landform at the base of an upland slope. The site encompasses an area of
approximately 70-x-30 m (2,100 m² [230-x-99 ft; 22,770 ft²]) in size and appears to be contained
within the current project corridor (Figure 77; see Figure C13). Vegetation consists of sparse
grasses, cacti, and yucca. The site appears to have poor to fair contextual integrity, with
disturbances consisting of erosion, eolian deflation, plowing, and a two-track that crosses the site.
Shovel tests showed loam with gravel extending to between 32 and 40 cmbs before encountering
bedrock.
The site was defined through the surface scatter since the two shovel tests excavated within the
scatter at the site were sterile. The surface scatter contains small quantities of flakes, large pieces
of shatter, and core fragments of Edwards chert. However, the possibility that the site represents
materials colluvially redeposited from the adjoining upland cannot be discounted. No cultural
materials were collected from the site.
The site is considered to have little or no remaining research potential based on the poor
contextual integrity and the lack of cultural deposits, diagnostic artifacts, or features.
Consequently, site 41NL245 is recommended as not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for
designation as an SAL. No further work is required at site 41NL245.
162

Site 41NL246 (Locus 148.02a-1)
Site 41NL246 is a lithic scatter belonging to an unknown prehistoric age. It was found on a very
gently sloping upland surface approximately 40 m east of an unnamed Plum Creek tributary. The
site occupies an area of 22-x-15 m (330 m² [72-x-49 ft; 3,528 ft²]) within the project corridor, but
appears to extend beyond the project boundary (Figure 78; see Figure C13). Vegetation at the
site consists of dispersed locust and juniper with scattered cacti. The site is considered to have
poor to fair contextual integrity based on minor erosional disturbances, primarily from animals,
and construction disturbances from a transmission line through the northern part of the site;
shovel tests encountered bedrock at approximately 50 cmbs.
The site was defined by a surface scatter of chert flakes, shatter, and core fragments. Three of the
10 shovel tests excavated in the area encountered cultural deposits from 0–50 cmbs (Table 55).
The four Edwards chert artifacts collected from the shovel tests consist of one unmodified flake,
one core with possible potlidding on one face, and two edge-modified flakes (one a secondary
flake and the other a thin flake fragment).
The portion of site 41NL246 within the project corridor appears to have limited research potential
based on the lack of cultural deposits, features, or diagnostic artifacts and the poor contextual
integrity. However, it is recommended as of unknown NRHP eligibility or for SAL designation
since the site likely extends beyond the current project corridor and could not be fully assessed.
The portion of site 41NL246 within the project boundary would not contribute to the site’s
significance if it were determined eligible at a later date. Consequently, no additional
investigation is required for the portion of site 41NL246 within the right-of-way.

Site 41NL247 (Locus 148.01a-2)
Site 41NL247 is a lithic scatter belonging to an undetermined prehistoric period found on a
terrace below a small bluff. The site is 74-x-39 m (2,886 m² [243-x-128 ft; 31,104 ft²]) in size
and is contained within the current project corridor (Figure 79; see Figure C13). Vegetation at
the site is composed of sparse grasses, yucca, and cacti. Contextual integrity is poor due to
erosion and the thin topsoil that varied between 4 and 31 cm deep observed through shovel
testing.
The site is entirely surficial in nature: none of the three shovel tests excavated within the site
contained cultural materials. The surface scatter included chert flakes, shatter, and core
fragments. No diagnostic artifacts or features were observed. Artifact density is low and no
artifact concentrations were noted. No cultural material was collected.
The site is considered to retain little to no research potential based on the poor contextual
integrity observed and the lack of cultural deposits, features, or diagnostic artifacts. Therefore,
site 41NL247 is recommended as not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as an
SAL. No further work is required at site 41NL247.

Site 41NL248 (Locus 148.01a-3)
Site 41NL248 is a lithic scatter of an unknown prehistoric period found near an upland edge
overlooking the Bitter Creek flood plain. The site measures approximately 190-x-50 m (9,500 m²
[623-x-164 ft; 102,107 ft²]) in size within the project right-of-way but extends beyond the project
corridor (see Figure 79; see Figure C13). Vegetation on the site consists of sparse grasses and
two isolated trees. The site has poor contextual integrity, having been disturbed by erosion,
plowing, pipeline construction, power line installations, and bulldozing. Shovel tests generally
encountered bedrock from 7–40 cmbs across the site, with only a few tests extending to 50–60
cmbs.
The site was identified through a low-density surface scatter and shovel testing. Artifacts
observed on the surface included two bifaces, flakes, and core fragments, all from varieties of
Edwards chert. Nine of the 29 shovel tests excavated to determine the site limits contained
cultural deposits to 30 cmbs. The two surficial bifaces were collected (Table 56). One of the
bifaces is a large roughout preform, and the other is a possible chopper fragment with likely
battering on a small section of one lateral edge. Artifacts recovered through shovel testing
include a uniface with three modified and worn edges, seven edge-modified flakes or shatter
(three secondary, one tertiary, two flake fragments, and one shatter), and seven pieces of
unmodified debitage (two flake fragments, three secondary flakes, one tertiary flake, and one
piece of shatter). All 17 collected artifacts are of Edwards chert.
The site portion within the project corridor is considered to have little or no research potential
based on the poor contextual integrity, low artifact density, and the lack of diagnostic artifacts or
features. Nonetheless, since site 41NL248 extends outside of the current project boundary and
could not be fully investigated, it is recommended as of unknown NRHP eligibility or SAL
designation. However, the portion of the site within the project boundary would not contribute to
its significance if site 41NL248 were determined eligible at a later date. Therefore, no further
work is recommended within the project right-of-way at site 41NL248.

Site 41NL249 (Locus 151a-1)
Site 41NL249 is a lithic scatter occupied during an undetermined prehistoric period found on a
gently sloping upland surface overlooking the Plum Creek basin. The site is approximately 108­
x-42 m (4,536 m2 [354-x-138 ft; 48,852 ft2]) after a slight adjustment of the project corridor to the

north by approximately 5 m, and appears to be entirely within the current project right-of-way,
although at one time it may have extended to the south prior to the creation of the dirt road that
likely destroyed that part of the site (Figure 80; see Figure C13). Vegetation observed at the site
includes grasses, locust, and juniper. Contextual integrity is fair to good, with disturbance limited
to minor amounts of erosion. Silty loam in the shovel tests extended from 15–65 cmbs before
encountering bedrock.
The site was identified through a surface scatter containing flakes (n=5), core fragments (n=3),
and a biface, the majority created from varieties of Edwards chert. Only the biface, a crude, early
aborted translucent chert specimen with a spokeshave on one lateral edge, was collected from the
surface of a shovel test (Table 57). Although four shovel tests were excavated within the site
boundary, none contained subsurface cultural deposits.
The site is considered to have little to no remaining research potential based on the low artifact
density, the lack of diagnostic artifacts or features, and the absence of any cultural deposits.
Consequently, the site is recommended as not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for
designation as an SAL and no further work is required at site 41NL249.

Site 41NL250 (Locus 152b-1)
Site 41NL250 is a prehistoric site of unknown age overlooking a first-order tributary of Stink
Creek. The site is approximately 160-x-50 m (8,000 m² [525-x-164 ft; 86,100 ft²]) in size within
the project corridor and appears to extend beyond the project right-of-way (Figure 81; Figure
C14). Vegetation in the site area is dense and includes juniper, mesquite, cacti, and thorn bushes.
Erosion, deflation, and utility construction have affected the site, giving it poor contextual
integrity. Clay/silty loam in shovel tests met bedrock at generally 10–45 cmbs.

The site boundary is based largely upon an extensive surface scatter of chert flakes. Three
positive shovel tests excavated at site 41NL250 contained one edge-modified flake (considered to
be Tecovas jasper), three unmodified pieces of debitage (two of chert, one of translucent chert),
as well as a piece of burned rock and charcoal (neither collected) (Table 58). One surficial
unmodified flake of chert was additionally collected. All subsurface materials were found in the
upper 10 cm of the shovel tests. No diagnostic artifacts were observed at the site.
Site 41NL250 appears to have limited research potential within the project corridor based on the
lack of diagnostic artifacts, the thin deposits encountered, and the poor contextual integrity.
However, it is recommended as of unknown NRHP eligibility or SAL designation since the site
extends beyond the current project corridor and could not be fully assessed. The portion of site
41NL250 within the project boundary would not contribute to the site’s significance if it were
determined eligible at a later date. Consequently, no additional investigation is required for the
portion of site 41NL250 within the right-of-way.

Site 41NL251 (Locus 155a-1)
Site 41NL251 is a lithic scatter associated with the Paleo-Indian period. The site was found on a
sloping alluvial surface adjacent to a second-order tributary of Stink Creek. Within the current
project corridor, the site measures 100-x-52 m (5,200 m2 [328-x-171 ft; 56,088 ft2]) within the
project boundary after a slight adjustment project corridor of approximately 3–4 m to the south;
however, the site extends outside of the project right-of-way (Figure 82; see Figure C14).
Vegetation consists of sparse grasses, cacti, yucca, and mesquite. The site appears to have poor
contextual integrity since the area appears to have been bladed, with clay subsoil exposed at the
surface in some areas and topsoil often associated with spoil piles. Bedrock was generally found
from 5–45 cmbs, although a limited number of shovel tests extended to 60–80 cmbs.
This site yielded a beautifully made, complete Plainview-like projectile point (FS 110/1) of
Edwards chert from the site surface (Table 59). The point exhibits a slightly concave and thinned
base, overall is very thin with parallel flaking, and measures approximately 59.0-x-25.4-x-6.8 mm
in size; the proximal one-third of both lateral edges have been ground (Figure 83). Comprising
the remaining collected assemblage are two Edwards chert unifaces (one marginally modified and
the other a denticulate—the only materials from the single positive shovel test [0–10 cmbs])—
and surficial pieces of unmodified debitage (16 of Edwards chert, two of quartz, two of probable
Tecovas jasper, and three of translucent chert) ranging from biface thinning flakes, secondary and
tertiary flakes, and flake fragments to shatter. The surface material was collected within a 1-m
radius of the projectile point and the only positive shovel test on the site. Additionally, FCR was
observed onsite but not collected.

Although a Plainview-like projectile point was found at the site, it was collected from the surface
and thus the portion of site 41NL251 within the project corridor is considered to have limited
research potential due to the poor contextual integrity and lack of features. Nonetheless, the site
is recommended as of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as an
SAL since it extends beyond the current project boundary. This portion of the site within the
right-of-way, however, would not contribute to its significance if it were determined eligible at a
later date. Therefore, no further work is required within the project right-of-way at site 41NL251.
Site 41NL252 (Locus 155c-1)—Tested
Original Oncor Corridor Survey
Site 41NL252 is a prehistoric campsite of an undetermined period found on a gently sloping
upland surface. The site boundary was defined by a surface scatter of artifacts and measured 170­
x-60 (10,200 m² [558-x-197 ft; 109,926 ft²]) within the project boundary, although the site likely
extends beyond the right-of-way (Figure 84; see Figure C14). Dense vegetation of grasses,
mesquite, juniper, yucca, and cacti covered the area. The site has been affected by erosion and by
a two-track road and construction of a gas pipeline at the southern edge of the site. Bedrock was
often at the surface and was consistently encountered in the shovel tests from 15–30 cmbs across
the site.
Even though 12 shovel tests were excavated in the site vicinity, no subsurface deposits were
encountered. However, one potential, burned rock midden feature was observed at the site. The
feature is approximately 8 m in diameter and 1–1.5 m in height. The observed artifacts included
burned rock, chert secondary and tertiary flakes, core flakes, flake tools, and biface fragments,
but no diagnostic artifacts were observed and no cultural materials were collected.
The site was considered to retain good research potential based on the presence of a possible
intact feature and was considered of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP. It was
recommended that the proposed construction avoid placing towers within the site boundary. If
this was not possible, further investigations such as monitoring were recommended within the
right-of-way at site 41NL252.

NRHP Testing Investigations
Subsequent to the original survey, two separate NRHP eligibility investigations were conducted
on December 15, 2010, and January 10, 2011, because of the planned placement of a transmission
tower on the western end of site 41NL252. In association with this tower, an impact area of
roughly 50 m N/S by 60 m E/W (3,000 m2 [164 ft N/S by 197 ft E/W; 32,300 ft2]) was
established, centering on the tower location (see Figure 84). The initial test investigations were
175

focused on the part of the site within the impact area. Immediately east of the site boundary, a
shallowly buried (46 cmbs [<18 inbs]) pipeline crosses the right-of-way and the southern edge of
the site at a severely oblique angle. After consultation with the construction crews, it appeared
that a greater portion of the site would be impacted than initially planned due to the presence of
the pipeline crossing. Thus, in January, a second day of testing was conducted within the portion
of the site with the highest artifact density.
The initial plan for investigating site 41NL252 was to perform a detailed surface survey at 5-m
intervals across the entire site and excavate multiple test units of various sizes within the impact
area. The surface survey indicated that the tower location and surrounding impact area were
located in an area of the site that had only a light artifact density. The main portion of the site
was on the northern edge of the right-of-way, east of the impact area. Investigations within the
impact area consisted of the excavation of 1-x-1-m TU 1 in the proposed location of the tower;
the placement of four individual 50-x-50-cm units (TUs 2–5) in each quadrant of the impact area;
and a 1-x-3-m excavation block (TUs 8–10) placed in the portion of the impact area most likely
to yield intact cultural materials (Figure 85). Additionally, two 50-x-50-cm units (TUs 6 and 7)
were placed east of the impact area near the center of the right-of-way to clear an area for heavy
machinery through the portion of the site in which only a sparse artifact scatter was present on the
surface.
A surface collection of nondiagnostic tools and several pieces of debitage across the site was
undertaken in December 2010. Four multidirectional cores (three chert, one jasper); seven edgemodified chert flakes; three chert biface fragments; two marginally modified unifaces (one chert,
one quartzite); and seven pieces of chert unmodified debitage (three secondary and two tertiary
flakes, a flake fragment, and a blade) comprised the surface assemblage. All chert artifacts were
of Edwards chert varieties.
During the excavation of the test units, the results of the unit placed in the proposed tower
location (TU 1) and the four 50-x-50-cm units (TUs 2–5) indicated that the site was largely
restricted to the surface. In each of these units, highly weathered bedrock was encountered within
30 cm of the surface. Each test unit was excavated either until 20 cm of sterile deposits were
encountered or until bedrock was encountered over more than 50 percent of the unit. Within each
2
of these five units, covering 2 m , a combined total of only four Edwards chert flakes (one
tertiary, three secondary) was recovered (Tables 60 and 61). No formal tools, diagnostic artifacts,
or datable materials were identified.
The placement of 50-x-50-cm TUs 6 and 7 east of the impact area was done in an attempt to
determine if subsurface cultural deposits were present on the top of a small hill east of the impact
area. Weathered bedrock was visible at a very shallow depth in the slope of the hill. A very light
scatter of lithic debitage was observed on the surface of the hill, though it was unclear how much
had been disturbed by the adjacent buried pipeline. It was thus not surprising that very few
artifacts were found within the test units (all of Edwards chert) and bedrock was encountered at a
very shallow depth (Table 62).
A 1-x-3-m excavation block (TUs 8–10) was excavated in the northeast portion of the impact area
near a concentration of lithic debitage on the surface. This area appeared to contain the densest
concentration of lithic materials within the impact area. However, only three flake fragments and
a core (all Edwards chert) were recovered in the 3 m2 excavated (Table 63). Weathered bedrock
was encountered within 20–30 cm of the surface and the units were terminated due to a lack of
recovery.
177

At the close of this December field investigation, it was recommended that the majority of the
right-of-way was clear for construction because the designated impact area only contained a light
scatter of materials that were unlikely to yield significant information. Unfortunately, given the
presence of the pipeline to the south, a greater portion of site 41NL252 would be impacted due to
the need to move heavy machinery traffic northward at the bottom the hill rather than across it as
initially assumed. Thus, five additional 1-x-1-m test units were subsequently excavated in
January 2011 in the densest portions of the site within the right-of-way east of the impact area
and north of the hill. TUs 11–15 were located within individual FCR and lithic debitage scatters
within the right-of-way, with TU 14 placed near the potential FCR midden in the northeastern
part of the right-of-way. Not surprisingly, the artifact concentration appeared to be limited to the
surface. Each of the units was excavated to weathered bedrock, which ranged from 10 cmbs to
40 cmbs (Table 64). The total number of debitage pieces recovered from these test units was only
20 (13 of which came from the unit surfaces) as well as one core, but abundant fragments of
burned rock were found (only a sample collected).

Summary and Recommendation
Though there were a number of individual burned rock and lithic debitage clusters on the site
(including the potential FCR feature), particularly across the bottom of the hill, no depth of
deposits was noted nor were diagnostic or dateable materials present. These limiting factors
reduce the research value of the portion of site 41NL252 within the right-of-way to extremely
limited, but the site is recommended as of unknown NRHP eligibility or SAL designation because
the full site could not be evaluated. However, no additional work is recommended within the
right-of-way, but should the portions of the site outside of the right-of-way later be found eligible,
this portion within the right-of-way would not affect the ultimate NRHP eligibility of site
41NL252.

Site 41NL253 (Locus 160a-1)
Site 41NL253 is a lithic scatter of an unknown prehistoric period found on a gently sloping rise
above a first-order tributary of Little Stink Creek. The site covers an area of 95-x-50 m (4,750 m²
[312-x-164 ft; 51,168 ft²]) within the project corridor, but extends beyond the project right-of­
way (Figure 86; see Figure C15). Sparse grasses, cacti, yucca, and a moderate to dense overstory
of locust and juniper form the vegetation in the site area. The area has been clear-cut in the past
based on the many dead trees and pushpiles resulting from their removal. The clear-cut may be
associated with the power line right-of-way south of the site or a pipeline right-of-way to the
north. In addition to these disturbances, a minimal amount of erosion was noted at the site.
Shovel tests revealed silty/clay loam varying generally from 15–45 cmbs, with only a limited
number of shovel tests extending to 60–80 cmbs before meeting bedrock.
The site was primarily defined by a surface scatter of chert flakes, shatter, and cores that extends
beyond the project right-of-way. One Edwards chert edge-modified flake with a possible
spokeshave was collected from the surface (Table 65). Only three of the 19 shovel tests
excavated at the site contained cultural materials. The six artifacts collected from a subsurface
context consist of a core fragment, four pieces of shatter, and a tertiary flake. Subsurface
material, all of chert, came primarily from the upper 10 cmbs, but ST R4 produced material to 60
cmbs. One of the pieces of shatter showed potlidding through heat alteration.

The site is considered to have little to no remaining research potential within the project corridor
based on the poor contextual integrity observed and the lack of any diagnostic artifacts or
features. However, the entire site has not been fully assessed because it extends beyond the rightof-way, so site 41NL253 is recommended as of unknown eligibility for NRHP inclusion or for
designation as an SAL, but the portion of the site within the right-of-way would likely not
contribute to the site’s significance if it were determined eligible at a later date. Therefore, no
further investigation is required with the project right-of-way at site 41NL253.

Site 41NL254 (Locus 19.01c-2)—Revisited
Site 41NL254 is a low-density scatter of approximately 10 lithic artifacts dating to an
undetermined prehistoric period found on a ridge top overlooking Kildoogan Creek as it enters
Santa Fe Lake to the south. The site measures 140-x-60 m (7,000 m²; 459-x-197 ft; 90,423 ft²])
within the project right-of-way, but appears to extend beyond the project corridor (Figure 87; see
Figure C9). Vegetation consists of mesquite, grasses, yucca, and cacti.
The site is shown in a gravel pit on the USGS 7.5' Busby quadrangle (1969), indicating poor
contextual integrity. Land modification and vegetation clearing have extensively disturbed the
entire site within the project right-of-way (Figure 88). During the initial corridor survey, the
landowner would not allow subsurface investigations or artifact collection. Therefore, the site
was defined solely through a low-density surface scatter of cores, possible edge-modified flakes,
and unmodified debitage.

After the easement was purchased and shovel testing was allowed, a revisit to the site was
undertaken in fall 2010. At the time of the revisit, the landowner had conducted extensive land
alternation and clearing of vegetation on the property and within the project right-of-way.
According to the ranch manager, land alternations to this property and to the site have been
ongoing for years, and soil was often moved from one place to another, as well as being brought
in from elsewhere. He further stated that the majority of the earth-moving activities within the
site boundary had occurred during the 1960s. Interestingly, shovel testing in the area indicated
that the most obvious areas of the site that had been “reclaimed” after its use as a gravel pit area
were on the south end of the corridor, while on the northern end, the “reclamation” was not as
obvious. Shovel tests showed gravely loam to depths varying from 30–55 cmbs.
During the revisit, 12 shovel tests were excavated in the vicinity of the site, but none yielded
artifacts. Roughly five pieces of debitage were observed on the surface of the site. No cultural
material was collected from this site.
Though site 41NL254 could not be fully evaluated because the portions of the site outside of the
project corridor were not investigated, the site as a whole is recommended as not eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as an SAL primarily because of its location in a former
gravel pit, as well as the extensive disturbances from massive land alternation and vegetation
clearing by the landowner that have occurred over time and the unknown origin of the artifacts
that were observed. No further work is recommended for site 41NL254.
Site 41NL255 (Locus 144.112d-1)
Site 41NL255 is a lithic scatter occupied during an undetermined prehistoric period found on a
gently sloping upland surface and bisected by a first-order tributary of Sweetwater Creek.
Sweetwater Creek is approximately 15 m west of the site. The site occupies an area 60-x-40 m
(2,400 m² [197-x-131 ft; 25,807 ft²]) in size within the project corridor (Figure 89; see Figure
C11); however, the site appears to extend beyond the project corridor. The site is situated in a
mature, forested area with juniper, mesquite, cacti, yucca, and grasses identified in the site area.
Erosion has had a variable impact upon the site, giving it poor contextual integrity. The onsite
shovel tests extended in depth to 30–35 cmbs before meeting subsoil. Some of the shovel tests
excavated near the site area contained 20–45 cm of clay loam soils, but others could not be
excavated due to slope or exposed subsoil.
184

Figure 88. Brush/pushpiles and land alteration on and surrounding site 41NL254 (facing southeast).

The site was identified solely through a surface scatter because neither of the shovel tests
excavated within the site boundary contained cultural materials. Artifacts observed at the site
include flakes, flake fragments, and possibly edge-modified flakes. No materials were collected
from the site.
The portion of site 41NL255 within the project corridor is considered to have limited research
potential because of erosion and thin soils indicating poor contextual integrity, as well as the lack
of features or diagnostic artifacts. However, the site could not be fully evaluated because the
portions of the site beyond the project corridor were not investigated. Consequently, site
41NL255 is recommended as of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation
as an SAL. The portion of the site within the corridor would not contribute to the site’s
significance if site 41NL255 were later determined eligible for the NRHP. No further work is
recommended for the portion of site 41NL255 within the project corridor.

Site 41NL256 (Locus 144.3-x)—Tested

Original Oncor Corridor Survey
Site 41NL256 is a possible campsite of an undetermined prehistoric period found on a sloping
upland surface adjacent to a first-order tributary of Sweetwater Creek. The site measures 105-x­
20 m (2,100 m² [344-x-66 ft; 22,704 ft²]) within the project corridor, but appears to extend
outside of the project corridor (Figure 90; see Figure C12). The site was covered by sparse
grasses and bushes, with forested areas noted north and east of the site. The site appears to have
poor to fair contextual integrity, with disturbances noted from erosion, chaining, and the
construction of a gas line and transmission line south of the site. Shovel testing revealed soils
between 10 and 20 cm deep, with the shallower units tending to be on the south side of the
corridor.

186

Site 41NL256 was defined solely through a surface scatter of bifaces, unifaces, edge-modified
flakes, flakes, tested cobbles, cores, and burned rock. None of these artifacts was collected. All
shovel tests excavated within the site boundary were sterile, although flakes and a biface (not
collected) were found on the surface near two shovel tests. Three features, consisting of small
concentrations of burned rock associated with flakes, edge-modified flakes, and bifaces, were
observed at the site. All features were found in eroded contexts. The variety of artifacts observed
at the site and the presence of possible features suggest a more intensive occupation of the area,
possibly a campsite. Although features were only found in an eroded context, additional features
could potentially exist in areas with greater subsurface integrity outside of the corridor.
The site could not be fully evaluated because the site area beyond the project corridor was not
investigated. However, based on the variety of artifacts discovered and the potential for
additional intact features, the portion of the site within the corridor was considered to have fair to
good research potential. The site was recommended as of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the
NRHP. Avoidance was recommended for this site. If avoidance was not possible, further
investigations should be conducted within the project corridor at site 41NL256.

NRHP Testing Investigations
Subsequent to the initial corridor survey, the final location for a transmission tower in the middle
of site 41NL256 was determined and an impact area of roughly 49 m N/S by 76 m E/W (2,724 m2
[160 ft N/S by 250 ft E/W; 40,000 ft2]) surrounding the tower location was established. Since the
site had been recommended for avoidance, a testing phase was established and carried out in mid
December 2010. The shallow site initially appeared to have some relatively intact cultural
features eroding into the already disturbed existing right-of-way of a previously installed
transmission line to the south of the current corridor. Prior to the testing investigations, the
current project corridor had been cleared by machinery. The cut vegetation and the machinery on
the shallow soils caused a loss of any potential integrity the site had within the corridor. Any
features initially identified during the shovel testing survey had been dispersed due to the clearing
activities (Figure 91).

pushpiles of brush from clearing activity, taken from TU 8; (R) view southwest, overview of site
41NL256, with brush pushpiles and evidence of heavy machinery.

189

Due to the proposed placement of the tower in the middle of the site, eight test units were
excavated in the impact area. A 1-x-1-m test unit (TU 1) was placed within the highest impact
area near the tower location, and four 50-x-50-cm units (TUs 2–5) were placed within the corners
of the impact area (Figure 92). Three flakes and a core were recovered from the surface and
upper 10 cm of TU 1. In TUs 2–4, a total of only five flakes and one edge-modified flake was
recovered (Table 66). In all cases, these materials were recovered in the upper 10 cm of the
profile. Among the debitage assemblage from these five units were one primary, one tertiary, and
four secondary flakes, as well as one flake fragment and one piece of shatter, all of Edwards
chert.
Additionally, a 1-x-3-m excavation block (TUs 6–8) was excavated at the southeastern edge of
the impact area to examine a dense concentration of lithic materials. The artifacts recovered in
these blocks were also restricted to the very near surface (Table 67). Four multidirectional
cores/tested cobbles, 18 pieces of unmodified debitage, and a single tertiary edge-modified flake
came from the test unit surfaces. Subsurface material (0–20 cmbs) consisted of 19 pieces of
unmodified debitage. Among the 37 specimens of unmodified debitage from these five units
were one primary and one tertiary flake, six secondary flakes, 24 flake fragments, and five pieces
of shatter—18 specimens from the test unit surfaces. Aside from one Alibates flake fragment
from the TU 6 surface, all these materials from the block were of Edwards chert.
In addition to the above material from the test units, four pieces of unmodified debitage as well as
two cores, three edge-modified flakes, and three early aborted complete bifaces were collected
from the general site surface. As with the overwhelming majority of raw material from the test
units, all were of Edwards chert.

Summary and Recommendations
The site was originally recommended for avoidance because of the burned rock and lithic
debitage clusters or features onsite and the varieties of lithic materials (flakes, edge-modified
flakes, bifaces) noted on the surface. Based on the testing results, it appears that the
concentrations of materials on, or very near, the surface within the site were definitely in
erosional contexts. The majority of the site appears to have been further disturbed by the corridor
clearing and preparation for construction activities as well as the existing transmission line.
Therefore, due to the lack of diagnostics, datable material, and the now-dispersed possible
features, as well as the erosion and artificial impacts such as the existing transmission line to the
south and the site clearing by machinery, the portion of site 41NL256 within the corridor is
considered to have limited research potential. Nonetheless, because the site extends beyond the
project corridor, it is recommended as of unknown eligibility for NRHP inclusion or for SAL
designation. However, if portions of the site located outside of this project corridor are later
determined to be eligible, this portion will not affect the site eligibility.

Site 41NL257 (Locus 144.3a-Y)
Site 41NL257 is a small lithic scatter occupied during an unknown prehistoric period found on a
gently sloping ridge between two first-order tributaries of Sweetwater Creek. The site covers an
area 95-x-50 m (4,750 m² [311-x-164 ft; 51,004 ft²]) in size within the project corridor, but
appears to extend beyond the corridor (Figure 93; see Figure C12). Vegetation at the site consists
of mature juniper and mesquite, cacti, yucca, and grasses. Erosion has variably affected the site

area, with patches of exposed subsoil observed, and gravel or bedrock encountered in shovel tests
at 5–15 cmbs. In addition, the remains of trees removed through chaining were found within the
site area. The site appears to have poor contextual integrity.
The site was located solely through a surface scatter of bifaces, unifaces, cores, flakes, and
possibly edge-modified flakes. All four shovel tests excavated within the site boundary were
sterile. No artifacts were collected. The variety of artifacts in the assemblage suggests that the
site may have had a more intensive occupation, perhaps serving as a campsite.
The site cannot be fully evaluated because the portions outside of the project corridor have not
been investigated, and therefore site 41NL257 is recommended as of unknown eligibility for
inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as an SAL. However, the portion of the site within the
project corridor is considered to have little remaining research potential based on the poor
contextual integrity and the lack of any features or diagnostic artifacts and would not contribute
to the site’s eligibility if site 41NL257 were later determined eligible for NRHP inclusion. No

Site 41NL258 (Locus 144.3a-Z)
Site 41NL258 is a lithic scatter possibly affiliated with the Paleo-Indian or Early Archaic periods.
It was found on an upland ridge finger overlooking a first-order tributary of Sweetwater Creek.
The site measures 110-x-50 m (5,500 m² [361-x-164 ft; 59,240 ft²]) in size within the project
corridor, but appears to extend beyond the corridor (Figure 94; see Figure C11). Vegetation in
the site area consists of grasses. The site is considered to have poor contextual integrity due to
erosion, extensive chaining, and bedrock outcrops, resulting in no subsurface deposits as
determined by shovel test that only extended to a maximum of 15–20 cmbs.
The site was defined through a surface scatter of bifaces, unifaces, cores, flakes, possible edgemodified flakes, and burned rock. All artifacts were found on bedrock outcrops or areas of
exposed subsoil. The only artifact collected from the site is a large, triangular-shaped projectile
point missing the distal portion (FS 209/1) (Table 68). The unstemmed, triangular-shaped, very
thin, basal fragment is broken at the estimated midpoint of the blade, possibly an impact break.
Although the point could not be assigned to a defined artifact type, its overall shape and its base
are similar to the Early Triangular dart point type that dates to the late Paleo-Indian or Early
Archaic period, but this Edwards chert specimen is much longer and wider and lacks fine edge
retouch (Figure 95). The extremely thin point fragment measures approximately 41 mm in extant
length by 35 mm maximum width at the base by 5 mm in thickness. The burned rock was found
scattered along a slope and may represent the remnants of a feature. None of the nine shovel tests
excavated in the site boundary contained subsurface cultural material, although three had flakes
(not collected) on their surfaces. The variety of artifact categories found in the assemblage
suggests a more extensive occupation, possibly a campsite.
The site has not been fully evaluated because it extends outside of the project corridor and is
therefore recommended as of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as
an SAL. However, the portion of site 41NL258 within the project corridor is considered to have
little research potential based on the poor contextual integrity and the lack of intact features and
would not contribute to the site’s significance if site 41NL258 were later determined eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP. No further work is recommended for the portion of site 41NL258 within
the project corridor.

ISOLATED FINDS OF CULTURAL MATERIAL

Original Oncor Corridor Survey

Observed Surface Isolated Finds
Most of the 41 observed (but not collected) isolated finds documented on the surface along the
route (see Figures C1–C15) consisted of prehistoric finds (n=33) of flakes (n=27) though two
edge-modified flakes, two cores, a possible preform, and one FCR were identified. The eight
historic isolated finds consisted of structural debris, a metal spoon, a corral, a scatter of railroad
remnants, three individual bricks (one, an “ACME PEARL”), and a brick pile.

Collected Isolated Finds
Twelve of the 15 collected isolated finds came from shovel tests not associated with a site, but
three isolated surface finds were collected as well (Table 69) (see Figures C4–C15).
Unfortunately, further shovel testing at each initial positive shovel test failed to produce the
additional cultural material required to meet site criteria in each instance. Thus, these 15 artifacts
(14 prehistoric and one historic) were designated as isolated finds. Four formal chipped stone
tools—a chopper (FS 122/1; Figure 96) created on a cortical cobble of translucent chert
exhibiting bifacial flake scars and significant battering at the junction of the two bifacial faces
from ST 143.112a L22, two scrapers from ST 145.1a-2 L11 and ST 157d-1 R1, and a biface from
157d-1 general surface—as well as three minimally modified flakes and seven pieces of
unmodified debitage were collected. The biface and two Edwards chert flakes were the
prehistoric surface artifacts within the assemblage not associated with a shovel test. The sole
historic artifact collected subsurface is the roughly rectangular-shaped piece of iron that has a
slight curve in one corner and could possibly be part of a knife blade.

Revisit/Reroute Corridor Isolated Finds

Observed Surface Isolated Finds
The isolated finds observed (not collected) on the surface during the shovel testing
revisits/reroute investigations consisted of three flakes and two historic ceramics. The historic
ceramics came from the same area as the bricks previously noted (Parcel 94), which according to
the landowner, were deposited when his property was used as a landfill for the debris from the
demolished 1951 courthouse.

Collected Subsurface Isolated Finds
Four isolated shovel tests not associated with a site yielded six subsurface artifacts (see Figure
C8). Unfortunately, radial shovel tests surrounding each initial positive shovel test failed to
produce the additional cultural material required to meet site criteria in each instance. Thus, these
subsurface artifacts from isolated shovel tests, as with the isolated surface materials, were
designated as isolated finds (Table 70).

HISTORIC ARCHITECTURAL STRUCTURES NOT ASSOCIATED WITH SITES
Thirteen privately owned properties along the project corridor were identified as having historicage (i.e., constructed in or prior to 1960) structures (Appendix B). The following discussion
presents descriptions of the historic structural resources that are not associated with
archaeological sites but are found within the 1,000-ft buffer (two resources, Resource 3 and
Resource 4, are associated with sites 41FS93 and 41FS96, respectively, and are discussed above
with those sites). For resources on a single property (e.g., Resource 2) that contained multiple
historic-age structures, each individual structure is described separately as SR 2a, SR 2b, etc.
Locational information is in Appendix C.

Resource 1
SR 1 is a one-story, side-gabled secondary structure constructed ca. 1940 and located about 40 m
(131 ft) south of the southern edge of the survey corridor (Appendix B:Figure B1; see Figure C1).
The structure, a barn, is wood-framed and clad in horizontal sheets of corrugated metal. The
metal siding appears to be a later addition. Its single-entry door is situated left of center on the
front façade. This barn was presumably associated with a domestic dwelling that has since been
demolished or moved. SR 1 lacks sufficient historical and architectural importance for listing in
the NRHP under Criteria A through C or for designation as an SAL, and is recommended not
eligible. Thus, it would not suffer any impacts from the proposed transmission emplacement.

Resource 2 (SRs 2a, 2b, 2c)
Located roughly 150 m (492 ft) south of the survey corridor southern edge, SR 2a is a frontgabled domestic dwelling constructed ca. 1950 (Figure B2; see Figure C1). Four metal poles
support its porch. Six-over-six paired windows are located on each side of the single-entry door
on the front façade. The structure is clad in stucco. The surrounding property includes an early
200

twentieth-century Aermotor windmill (SR 2b; Figure B3) and a single-story, front-gabled barn
(SR 2c; Figure B4). A nonhistoric-age garage is located to the rear of the dwelling. Historic
aerial photographs from 1948 show a different dwelling at this location; aerial photographs from
1966 show the present dwelling and barn, with the addition of several other outbuildings. These
alterations to the landscape, in addition to the presence of a wind turbine nearby, have
significantly altered setting, feeling, and association for these structures. SRs 2a–2c are
recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP under Criteria A through C or for designation
as an SAL. Thus, these structures would not suffer any impacts from the proposed transmission
emplacement.

Resource 3 (SRs 3a, 3b, 3c)
Two small buildings currently used to house farm equipment (SRs 3a and 3b) and a windmill (SR
3c). See discussion for site 41FS93.

Resource 4 (SRs 4a, 4b, 4c)
Three standing structures: a concrete dwelling (SR 4a), a concrete trough (SR 4b), and a stone
cistern (SR 4c). See discussion for site 41FS96.

Resource 5
Resource 5 is an early twentieth-century Aermotor windmill located roughly 100 m (328 ft) south
of the survey corridor (Figure B5; see Figure C4). The windmill, which is an example of one of
the most common windmill types (Baker 1985) seen in the field today, was presumably
associated with a domestic dwelling or agricultural outbuilding that has since been demolished or
moved; a rectangular structure is present at this location on a 1966 historic aerial photograph.
Due to its commonality in type and its lack of association with a historic farmstead, Resource 5
lacks sufficient historical and architectural importance for listing in the NRHP under Criteria A
through C or for designation as an SAL and is recommended not eligible. Thus, it would not
suffer any impacts from the proposed transmission construction.

Resource 6
Located approximately 100 m (328 ft) north of the project survey corridor outer edge, Resource 6
is a metal flat-roofed shed constructed ca 1940 (Figure B6; see Figure C6). It is barely visible
through the tree line from the project corridor and is most likely associated with a domestic
dwelling on the property. The rectangular building contains several stalls and appears to have
been associated with livestock at one point. Resource 6 lacks sufficient historical and
architectural importance for listing in the NRHP under Criteria A through C or for designation as
an SAL and is recommended not eligible. Thus, Resource 6 would not suffer any impacts from
the proposed emplacement.

201

Resource 7
Resource 7 is an early twentieth-century Aermotor windmill located at the very edge of the
southern corridor boundary (Figure B7; see Figure C6). An example of one of the most common
windmill types (Baker 1985) seen in the field today, Resource 7 lacks sufficient historical and
architectural importance for listing in the NRHP under Criteria A through C or for designation as
an SAL and is recommended not eligible. Thus, Resource 7 would not suffer any impacts from
the proposed transmission construction.

Resource 8
Located within the survey corridor, Resource 8 is an early twentieth-century Aermotor windmill
(Figure B8; see Figure C6). An example of one of the most common windmill types seen in the
field today (Baker 1985), Resource 8 lacks sufficient historical and architectural importance for
listing in the NRHP under Criteria A through C or for designation as an SAL and is
recommended not eligible. Thus, Resource 8 would not suffer any impacts from the proposed
transmission construction.

Resource 9
Noted on the project aerial maps, Resource 9 was not visible from the survey corridor (Figure B9;
see Figure C6). Because of its distance from the corridor, no information was available and it
would likely not suffer any impacts from the proposed construction.

Resource 10 (SRs 10a, 10b)
SR 10a is a one-story, four-bay, wood-framed barn constructed ca. 1950 and located about 50 m
(164 ft) south of the southern edge of the survey corridor (Figure B10; see Figure C7). The barn
is clad in horizontal metal siding, but several bays are missing siding. The barn may have been
associated with a domestic dwelling that has since been demolished or moved, but this cannot be
confirmed by historic aerials from the 1960s. SR 10b is an early twentieth-century Aermotor
windmill, representative of one of the most common windmill types seen in the field today (Baker
1985). SRs 10a and 10b lack sufficient historical and architectural importance for listing in the
NRHP under Criteria A through C or for designation as an SAL and are recommended not
eligible. Thus, they would not suffer any impacts from the proposed transmission line
emplacement.

Resource 11 (SRs 11a, 11b)
SR 11a is a two-story, one-bay agricultural outbuilding of an unknown construction date (Figures
B11, B12, B13, B14; see Figure C10). The building is constructed entirely of reinforced, formed
concrete. The south elevation has a small square window-like opening on the first story and a
segmental arch on the second story. The north elevation has two segmental arches, one on each
story of the structure. A short, walled, chute-like entrance on the exterior of this elevation is
thicker at ground level than at the top. Remnants of a wood frame can be seen around the south
202

elevation second-story opening, which indicates that the openings were most likely covered by
doors. The outer edges of the arched-end walls are parallel at the top near the large arched
openings, but on the interior taper slightly inward below the arch to the ground, suggesting a
thicker wall footing similar to that noted in the chute-like entrance on the north elevation. This
structure appears in the 1966 USGS (1966) aerial photograph and was presumably associated
with a larger agricultural enterprise that is no long extant. Its function is unknown. SR 11a may
contain sufficient historical and architectural importance for listing in the NRHP under Criteria A
through C and for designation as an SAL and is thus recommended as potentially eligible.
However, due to its location outside of the current project corridor, it would not suffer any
impacts from the proposed transmission emplacement.
SR 11b (Figure B15) is also made of reinforced concrete and is composed of a T-shaped wall
dividing a concrete pad situated about 30 m south of SR 11a and was likely associated, though its
function is currently unknown. It does not appear to have had a roof. SR 11b lacks sufficient
historical and architectural importance for listing in the NRHP under Criteria A through C or for
designation as an SAL and is recommended not eligible. Thus, it would not suffer any impacts
from the proposed transmission emplacement.

Resource 12
Resource 12, constructed ca. 1960, is a one-story structure associated with the BNSF railroad; it
currently is the office for the Sweetwater BNSF Yard House (Figure B16; see Figure C10). The
structure is clad in brick and has a corrugated metal side-gabled roof. The wall on the north
elevation of the structure expands outward at the eave. The structure appears on the 1961 general
highway map (Texas State Highway Department 1961b) and 1966 USGS (1966) aerial
photograph, and does not appear to have been altered. Resource 12 lacks sufficient historical and
architectural importance for listing in the NRHP under Criteria A through C or for designation as
an SAL and is recommended not eligible. Thus, it would not suffer any impacts from the
proposed transmission emplacement.

Resource 13
Resource 13 is a one-story, three-bay, wood-frame dwelling constructed ca. 1940 (Figure B17;
see Figure C10). The dwelling is clad in horizontal metal siding that appears to be a later
addition. The gabled roof is sheathed with corrugated metal. Exposed rafters appear along the
east and west elevations. The centrally located single-entry door is flanked by wood-frame, 6/6
double-hung windows. A corrugated metal, gabled-roof porch, with wood-post supports, projects
from the façade over the single-entry door. This structure appears on the 1966 USGS (1966)
aerial photograph; however, the documentation of the structure on general highway maps is
inconsistent. A structure appears in this location on the 1940 General Highway Map of Nolan
County, but does not appear on the 1961 General Highway Map of Nolan County (Texas State
Highway Department 1940, 1961b). It is unclear whether or not the structures on the 1940 map
and on the 1966 aerial are indeed the same. Resource 13 lacks sufficient historical and
architectural importance for listing in the NRHP under Criteria A through C or for designation as
an SAL and is recommended not eligible. Thus, it would not suffer any impacts from the
proposed transmission emplacement.

CHAPTER 6
ANALYSIS OF PROBABILITY MODEL

This section will attempt to evaluate the effectiveness of the probability model used in this study.
The model was presented in the background review conducted prior to this survey (Dayton
2009:23, 27):
To assess archeological potential (i.e., the likelihood of containing additional archeological sites),
landforms throughout the study area were classified according to their potential for prehistoric
occupation and for containing intact deposits. Low-probability ratings were given to depressions,
swales, and water features such as ponds. Relatively stable upland landforms such as remnant plains,
ridges, interfluves, and high terraces were classified as medium-probability areas. In addition, the
east side of the study area is part of a “northern Cretaceous outlier” of Antlers Sand and
Fredericksburg Limestone relative to the main mass of the Edwards Plateau to the south (Boyd
2004:298). Like sedimentary formations throughout the greater Edwards area, these deposits contain
considerable quantities of workable chert, a highly valued resource and powerful influence on
prehistoric site location (Banks 1990). Still, most of the previously documented archeological sites in
the Tonkawa–Sweetwater East study area are located in proximity to drainage features, from major
streams to ephemeral gullies. Therefore, a 1-kilometer buffer (a zone with a total width of 2
kilometers) was plotted around all known channels, based on USGS and NRCS datasets. Mediumprobability landforms intersecting the 1-kilometer buffer were upgraded to high probability, with the
high-probability rating extending beyond the buffer to reflect the landforms’ continuity. Although not
all of the known sites were included within the initial 1-kilometer buffer, the extension of the highprobability rating to landforms intersecting the buffer did allow the capture of almost all known
archeological sites within high-probability zones. The resulting shapefiles, then, represent zones of
prehistoric archeological high, medium, and low potential based on currently available data.
The potential for historic sites—primarily related to late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century
ranching, farming, oil drilling, and mining—is considered high for the entire study area. In adjacent
study areas, soil maps from the 1930s show approximately 1–5 structures per section (1 mile-by-1
mile or 1.6 km-by-1.6 km) in rural areas (Carter et al. 1931). These structures include not only
farmsteads and other unidentified buildings but also named rural churches and schools, some of
which are no longer shown on modern maps. Most of these structures are located immediately
adjacent to section-line roads. At the present time, the status of these structures is unknown;
however, these examples illustrate the ubiquity of historic occupations on the landscape of the study
area. As more specific transmission line corridors are defined, the grid of section-line roads can be
used to pinpoint particular locations at which field checks can be performed.

205

The check of section-line roads for historic structures described above was performed primarily
by the architectural historian in the performance of her survey, so the probability shapefile used
for the archaeological survey essentially measures the potential for prehistoric sites only. Using
this probability model, 69 percent of the Tonkawa to Sweetwater East project area was defined as
high probability, 30 percent as moderate probability, and 1 percent as low probability (note that
for the sake of simplicity this calculation was done using the latest transmission corridor route
available at the time of writing).
The survey identified a total of 46 sites within the project area. Of these, 43 were found in highprobability zones and only three in medium-probability zones. The three found in mediumprobability zones were all historic in nature. As described in the background review, the
probability model focuses primarily on the potential for prehistoric sites, so it is not surprising
that historic sites would not be predicted by the model. Based on the results of the survey, it
appears that the probability model successfully included the areas most likely to have prehistoric
sites in the high-probability zones.
Given that it does not appear that high-probability areas were left out, another question is whether
the definition of the high-probability zones is too broad. A 1-km buffer of every water source
may seem excessive. The majority of the prehistoric sites were found within 100 m of an extant
water source, but there were a number found at significantly greater distances. Only two were
found at distances greater than 500 m, site 41NL245 at approximately 650 m and site 41NL252 at
approximately 1km from the nearest water source. It seems reasonable that the probability model
could be tightened somewhat, perhaps only including landforms within 500 m of a water source,
without excluding a significant number of prehistoric sites.
Finally, when using a probability model to determine the level of effort to use while surveying
different areas, there is always a potential for the model to determine rather than predict the
results. The significant decrease in the density of shovel testing in moderate- and low-probability
zones, it would seem, would result in fewer sites found even if the actual density of sites present
remained the same as in the high-probability zones. During this survey, however, all but one of
the sites identified had a visible surface component (prehistoric site 41NL235, located in an area
of thick brush where surface observation was impossible, is the lone exception). The testing
strategies for high, medium, and low probability differed in the amount of subsurface testing, but
all required surface observation along the two transect lines. Therefore, it is unlikely that the
decreased density of shovel testing in medium- and low-probability areas resulted in significant
numbers of sites being missed. Additionally, the overwhelming prevalence of surface scatters
indicates that systematic shovel testing is an inefficient method of locating sites in this area, in
comparison to pedestrian reconnaissance.
In conclusion, based on the results of the Tonkawa to Sweetwater East survey, the probability
model appears to identify high-probability zones that are sufficiently broad and appropriately
targeted to locate prehistoric sites within the project area. However, these zones are likely
somewhat too broad, and the efficiency of the survey could have been improved by reducing the
buffer distance around water sources.

CHAPTER 7
SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

This archaeological investigation was initiated with survey in April 2010 and conducted
intermittently through February 2011 as parcels became available. Subsequent to the final
determination of the corridor route and tower placements within sites, testing of seven sites was
undertaken in February 2011. The architectural study was conducted the week of 3–7 May 2010.
The investigations of the transmission line corridor encompassed a total of 35.1 miles (56.5
kilometers) in length by 160 feet (48.7 meters) in width, comprising approximately 673.5 acres
(272.6 hectares), which included two small reroutes totaling 2.9 miles (49.5 acres [20 hectares]).
A total of 2,814 shovel tests was excavated along the line and to delineate sites: 2,527 in highprobability areas (approximately 426 acres or 69 percent of the line), 286 in medium-probability
areas (183.7 acres or 30 percent of the line), and one in a low-probability area (6.4 acres or 1
percent of the line) where it intersected with a medium/low boundary.
During the course of the survey, 49 archaeological sites were recorded—34 prehistoric, eight
historic-age sites, and seven that contain both prehistoric and historic components. Most of
these sites exhibit some degree of disturbance, ranging from minor animal burrowing or animal
surface traffic to moderate erosion to several with extreme disturbances from modern activities
(i.e., 41NL254, used as a former gravel pit and massive earth-moving activities by landowner;
41NL232, recent disturbances from grubbing/clearing with tracked vehicles, expanses of surface
bedrock, and railroad and two-track construction adjacent to or through the site area; 41NL104,
clearing and grading with recently constructed, in-place transmission tower).
Eight sites—41FS104, 41FS105, 41FS109, 41NL238, 41NL243, 41NL244, 41NL252,
41NL256—were originally recommended for avoidance or for additional work if avoidance was
not possible because of the potential to contain data pertinent to understanding prehistoric
lifeways or, in the case of FS109 and NL243, because of the lack of landowner permission to
excavate.
Seven sites—41FS104, 41FS105, 41FS109, 41NL243, 41NL244, 41NL252,
41NL256—were subsequently tested because of planned tower installations within the sites. In
addition, 13 structures resources—two associated with sites in the project corridor and 11 within
the 1,000-ft buffer zone around the corridor—were evaluated. Also documented along the
corridor were 57 isolated find locations.

207

ARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS

Prehistoric Sites/Components
Most of the 34 identified prehistoric sites and seven prehistoric site components are primarily
surface scatters of artifacts. The depth of the cultural deposits on most sites was less than 50–60
cmbs, although test units at sites 41NL243 (TU 14; 0–150 cmbs) and 41NL244 (TUs 3 and 7; 0–
120 cmbs) yielded materials from depth. Two sites, 41NL252 and 41NL256, were initially
considered to have possible remnant burned rock middens but subsequent testing of those sites
failed to identify any form to the FCR to indicate remains of rock middens. The remaining sites
had no features or subsurface depth or integrity.
The majority of the chipped stone observed from prehistoric sites or site components was
varieties of chert (n=1,892) with significantly lesser amounts of translucent chert (n=267) and
minimal representation of quartzite (n=8), jaspers (n=5) quartz (n=2), and Alibates (n=1)
specimens mixed in, which is typical of Central Texas lithic assemblages.
Time-diagnostic or probable-typed diagnostic projectile points and cultural material that could
possibly indicate a temporal/cultural affiliation were recovered from five sites:
 41NL72—possible Paleo-Indian point midsection (surface)
 41NL236—small arrow point preform (surface)
 41NL243—Marcos-like (30–40 cmbs), Archaic; Corner-tang biface (surface), Late Archaic;
and an untyped arrow point midsection (20–30 cmbs), Late Prehistoric
 41NL251—Plainview-like (surface), Paleo-Indian
 41NL258—Early Triangular-like (surface) possible Paleo-Indian or Early Archaic
In additional to projectile points, 41NL243 yielded two sherds of untyped prehistoric ceramics
(one with incising) from TU 6 (10–20 cmbs), providing further confirmation of an affiliation of a
Late Prehistoric occupation at this site.
The remaining prehistoric sites/components lacked any time-diagnostic materials and contained
no intact, stratified cultural materials or features that might yield additional information that
would improve our understanding of the prehistory of this area. Therefore, those sites are
designated as representing unknown prehistoric occupations.
Aside from time-diagnostic materials, other chipped stone tools were recovered during the
project:
 four finished bifaces—a drill, the extreme tip of an untyped dart point, a chopper, and a
presumed biface/knife; only the chopper was recovered from depth (35 cmbs)
 29 unfinished bifaces—ranging from unidentified fragments to early aborted to an arrow
preform; 14 from a surface context, 15 from subsurface contexts
 12 unifaces—a burin, a denticulate, four scrapers, five marginally modified, and one
indeterminate fragment; seven from depth (0–50 cmbs)
 73 edge-modified flakes—57 from depth (0–130 cmbs)

208

Also among the collected assemblage from this project are the following:
 four ground stone pieces—two hammerstones (one from the surface, the other from 90–100
cmbs), one mano/hammerstone (surface), and a multipurpose battered/smoothed cobble (60–
70 cmbs)
 28 cores—26 chert, one each of jasper and quartzite; 13 from depth (0–60 cmbs)
 2,026 pieces of unmodified debitage—1,933 from depth (0–150 cmbs)

Historic Sites
Eight historic sites and seven historic site components were recorded along the project corridor.
Aside from three sites that were considered to be historic dumps (41FS95, FS97, FS106), archival
deed-title research was undertaken for each of the sites and components. As with the prehistoric
sites, the majority of the historic sites/components were composed of surface scatters of artifacts,
though sites 41FS93, 41FS96, and 41FS104 contained structural features. Only at site 41FS96
are the structures (Resource 4) considered an integral part of the site; the standing structures
consist of a ca. 1930s dwelling and two undateable features—a concrete trough and stone cistern.
Though the lack of archaeological deposits makes the site less than impressive for extending our
knowledge of early twentieth-century rural agricultural settlement or practices in the area, the
structures are more interesting and it was hoped that detailed deed title research would indicate
eligibility under Criterion Aunfortunately that was not the case. The standing structures at
41FS93 (Resource 3) are two ca. 1930–1940 agricultural sheds and an early twentieth-century
windmill (SRs 3a–3c). The architectural remains at 41FS104 are primarily remnant features of
prior structures—foundation footers for a large building and a storm cellar depression—but also
associated features of a brick-and-concrete-lined cistern, two brick water collection structures,
and a brick chimney. Detailed archival research proved that this was the site of the early
twentieth-century Gannon School and that the building was important to the community even
after the school was closed.
Functionally classifiable material recovered from historic occupations was primarily Domestic
(n=226), Architectural (n=210), and Activities (n=102) items, with a minimal representation of
Personal items (n=19):
 The majority of the Domestic items were of indeterminate dates (n=124), but those that could
be dated were primarily glass fragments ranging from the 1850s–post-1954, with 57 glass
items representing pre-1900 initial production dates and 30 fragments with initial post-1900
dates.
 Architectural items consisted primarily of window glass—167 fragments of indeterminate
production dates as well as 12 with post-1880 dates—and 26 wire nails (post-1890).
 Among the Activities category, the assemblage was primarily undateable since most items
were coal and cinder pieces (n=97).
 Dateable Personal items ranged from the 1890s to post-1942); seven could be dated to pre­
1900 initial production dates and seven to post-1900 initial production dates.
Within the overall historic artifact assemblage, the majority (n=448) could not be dated, but
among the artifacts that could be dated to pre-1899, most fell into the post-1880s range (n=102),
and those with a post-1900 initial production date totaled 47. These initial production dates put
the general occupation along the corridor in the late 1800s to the mid-twentieth century.

209

Isolated Finds
Of the 57 isolated find locations, 44 consisted of prehistoric materials, 12 yielded historic
materials, and one was a mussel shell recovery. The observed (but not collected) isolated find
locations from the general surface of the project corridor primarily consisted of flakes, but also
noted were cores, a possible preform, and utilized tools. The observed historic isolated find
locations yielded structural debris consisting of individual bricks (one, an “ACME PEARL”) and
a brick pile, as well as historic ceramics, a metal spoon, a metal pile, a piece of rubber, a corral, a
scatter of railroad remnants, and an isolated windmill.
The 21 collected isolated finds were composed of shovel test subsurface recoveries of a core, an
edge-modified flake, unmodified flakes and shatter, and a uniface, as well as a historic metal bar.
Surface-collected artifacts were composed of two unmodified lithics and a biface. The subsurface
material came from isolated shovel tests with no surrounding or additional cultural material
found.

Recommendations
The archeological sites were primarily evaluated under NRHP Criterion D—having or may be
likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history. Deed/title research for the historic-era
sites failed to yield information that would meet NRHP significance criteria for association with
important events in history (Criterion A), or association with significant persons in the past
(Criterion B), or representative of significant architectural styles or construction methods
(Criterion C) (36 CFR Part 60.4 [a–d]). Eligibility for SAL designation was based on criteria
related to preservation of materials (Criterion A), intact cultural deposits (Criterion B), potential
to contribute to history (Criterion C), unique attributes (Criterion D), and capable of contributing
to scientific knowledge (Texas Natural Resources Code 1977; Title 9, Chapter 191, Texas
Antiquities Committee, Section 191.094 and Chapter 41.7, Antiquities Code of Texas). The
following recommendations are presented for the 49 investigated sites along the transmission
corridor.
Sixteen sites are confined to within the surveyed project corridor (Table 71).
 Not Eligible: Based on current investigations that primarily reveal shallow to nonexistent
soils or extensive disturbances with no intact subsurface deposits as well as limited,
nondiagnostic artifact assemblages, these 16 sites are recommended not eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as an SAL, with no further work necessary.
Thirty-three sites extend beyond the project corridor (see Table 71):
 Not eligible: Two of these sites—41NL232 and 41NL254—are recommended not eligible.
The sites have been so disturbed both within and beyond the corridor that they are
recommended not eligible for NRHP inclusion or for SAL designation. No further work is
necessary at these sites.

* = Extends beyond survey corridor
‡ = R=Site on reroute corridor
╪ = T=Site tested
** = Site integrity within and beyond corridor destroyed by ground disturbance

 Unknown Eligibility: Thirty-one of these sites are recommended as of unknown NRHP
eligibility or for SAL designation because each site extends beyond the project corridor and
could not be fully assessed:
o Avoidance or Monitoring:
 Tested site 41FS104, although disturbed by tower emplacement, is still recommended
for avoidance from any future ground disturbance because numerous features are
within and beyond the project corridor, and further investigations have the potential to
reveal more information about this early twentieth-century school site. The use of
rubber-tired vehicles and further hand clearing of vegetation is recommended during
maintenance activities.
 Site 41NL238 is still recommended for avoidance since it was not tested because
tower installation was not planned within the site. Therefore, the site should still be
avoided by future ground-disturbing activities within the site or tested if future
avoidance is not possible during maintenance activities.
212

 Site 41NL243 is recommended both for further monitoring if any future subsurface
maintenance activities become necessary because an intact cultural feature exists
between 110 and 130 cmbs, and for hand-clearing of vegetation and the use of rubbertired vehicles within the project area.
 Site 41NL244 is recommended for monitoring if activities associated with
maintenance of the Oncor transmission tower will extend through the depth of
subsurface cultural materials.
o No further work within the project corridor:
 Because of the corridor reroute, tested site 41FS105 is now entirely outside of the
project corridor and, based on testing excavations, is recommended as of unknown
eligibility. No further work is recommended for the site within the project corridor.
 The three remaining tested sites—41FS109, 41NL252, 41NL256—are still of
unknown eligibility because they extend beyond the project area, but no further work
is recommended for these sites within the project corridor.
 No further work within the project corridor is considered necessary at the remaining
23 sites because those portions within the corridor would not contribute to the
eligibility if a later determination of eligible for NRHP inclusion or SAL designation
were made.
Since by definition an isolated find does not meet the criteria for site designation, none of the
finds documented during this project can be considered for NRHP inclusion.

STANDING STRUCTURES NOT ASSOCIATED WITH SITES
The architectural survey identified 13 properties with historic-age (i.e., built in or prior to 1960)
standing structures (some properties with multiple structures) within the current project corridor
or within the 1,000-ft buffer area around the survey corridor (Table 72). The evaluated 21
individual resources date predominantly from the early twentieth century to ca. 1940, but two
resources were constructed ca. 1950s and one ca. 1960. Most evaluated structures were
agricultural outbuildings, although four were domestic dwellings. Only two of these resources
(Resources 3 and 4) were associated with archaeological sites (41FS93 and 41FS96,
respectively). Among the 11 properties in the buffer zone, SR 11a is a unique farm outbuilding
of unknown function or construction date and is recommended as potentially eligible for NRHP
listing under Criteria A–C (36 CFR Part 60.4 [a-c]) and for SAL designation (Title 9, Chapter
191). The other resources are recommended not eligible for NRHP inclusion or for SAL
designation because they fail to meet the significance criteria. None of these resources will be
affected by this project.
