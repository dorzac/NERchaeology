ABSTRACT

Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI), under contract to CDS/Muery Services, conducted archeological
investigations along the proposed 2.75-mile (4.4-kilometer) route of a proposed San Antonio
Water System (SAWS) sewer line replacement along a portion of Quintard Street between Hart
Avenue and 97th Street in southwestern Bexar County, Texas. The construction easement for the
project is 40 feet (12.2 meters) wide.
The archeological field investigations involved both windshield reconnaissance and intensive
pedestrian survey within the construction easement. Between Hart Avenue and March Street
(2.35 miles [3.8 kilometers]), sewer line replacement will involve slip-lining. Thus, a
reconnaissance survey and impact evaluation was performed. Intensive survey was performed
within the project corridor south of March Street where open cutting will be utilized in an area
comprising a total length of 0.4 mile (660 meters). Twelve shovel tests were placed where
drainage, soils, vegetation, and low levels of disturbance suggested archeological sites might be
preserved. Thirty-nine previously documented archeological sites are within 1 mile (1.6
kilometers) of the proposed construction project, but none is within the project right-of-way.
Numerous historic artifacts dating between 1880 and 1930 were identified in shovel tests within
disturbed contexts. The artifacts were likely deposited within fill associated with the installation
of the sewer pipelines in 1890 and 1950. In view of the highly disturbed context of the cultural
materials, the occurrence of the materials was not designated as an archeological site and thus not
considered eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places or for designation as a
State Archeological Landmark. No historic properties will be affected by the proposed sewer
line.
All materials generated by this project will be permanently curated at the Center for
Archeological Research at the University of Texas at San Antonio.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

San Antonio Water System (SAWS) is planning to replace two parallel sewer pipelines near
Stinson Municipal Airport in southwestern Bexar County (Figure 1). Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI), of
Plano, Texas, was contracted by CDS/Muery Services, the SAWS contractor for this project, to
provide the archeological investigation for the lower segment of the project. The project area is
approximately 4.4 kilometers (km; 2.75 miles [mi]) long and has a construction easement of 12.2
meters (m; 40 feet [ft]) wide. Fieldwork was conducted on March 22 and 23, 2010, by GMI
archeologists Arlo McKee and Lindsey Skelton. Melissa Green, also of GMI, served as Principal
Investigator for the project.
The project easement is in southwestern Bexar County, a short distance west of the intersection of
Southeast Military Drive and Roosevelt Avenue in San Antonio. Specifically, the project area
begins at East Hart Avenue 50 m (164 ft) west of Roosevelt Avenue and proceeds in a
southeasterly direction following Quintard Street until it reaches Southeast Military Drive (Figure
2). After crossing Southeast Military Drive, the project area continues along the same
southeasterly line crossing through residential and commercial properties until it reaches March
Street. South of March Street, the project area passes through Stinson City Park until it reaches
Roosevelt Avenue near the intersection of 94th Street. The project terminates at 97th Street on the
east side of Roosevelt Avenue. North of March Street, rehabilitation of the existing 72-inch
concrete sewer pipelines will be achieved by slip-lining insertion of 66-inch fiberglass pipes,
whereas south of March Street, open cutting will be utilized. A reconnaissance survey was
performed for areas where slip-lining will occur, and pedestrian survey involving shovel testing
was performed in areas where open cutting is proposed.
The current survey was undertaken to provide baseline information for the project environmental
assessment as required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 [42 U.S.C. Â§Â§
4321â4347; P.L. 91â190; 83 Stat. 852]. This investigation was conducted to fulfill compliance
with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended through
2000 [16 U.S.C. Â§ 470 et seq.; P.L. 89â665; 80 Stat. 915], requiring cultural resources survey. In
addition, the ultimate client, SAWS, is a political subdivision of the state of Texas and must
comply with the Antiquities Code of Texas [Title 9, Chapter 191, the Natural Resources Code of
Texas]. Accordingly, the present investigation was conducted under Texas Antiquities Code
permit #5425. The ultimate goal was to identify and inventory cultural resources contained
1

within the proposed project APE and to evaluate their potential for inclusion in the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or for designation as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL).
All materials generated from this project will be permanently housed at the Center for
Archeological Research (CAR) at the University of Texas at San Antonio.

CHAPTER 2
ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT

PHYSIOGRAPHY
Bexar County includes portions of three physiographic regions: the Edwards Plateau, the
Blackland Prairie, and the Rio Grande Plain (also known as the South Texas Coastal Plain). The
Edwards Plateau is north and west; the Blackland Prairie is east and southeast; and the Rio
Grande Plain is south and southwest. The Balcones Fault Zone, which runs through this area of
Texas, is characterized by undulating and hilly topography that ranges from about 213 to 335 m
(700â1100 ft) amsl. The area is dissected by small streams (Taylor et al. 1991). Chert, a raw
material for the production of stone tools, is found in outcrops throughout the project area,
particularly in the Balcones area. At the southern fringe of the Edwards Plateau, the Balcones
Canyonlands is a natural subregion of Texas that has a landscape dissected by numerous high
gradient streams in steep-sided canyons that flow south and southeast to the Gulf of Mexico
(Riskind and Diamond 1988:1).

GEOLOGY AND SOILS
The Geologic Atlas of Texas has mapped the surficial geology underlying the project area as
consisting of Quaternary Fluvatile Terrace deposits (Bureau of Economic Geology 1983). The
U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), shows three
soil map units within the project area: Sunev clay loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes; Branyon clay, 0 to
1 percent slopes; and Lewisville silty clay, 0 to 1 percent slopes (NRCS 2010).
The Sunev clay loam is mapped on narrow stream terraces containing loamy alluvium of
quaternary age derived from mixed sources. Sunev soils are very deep, moderately permeable
and are classified as fine-loamy, carbonaitic, thermic Udic Calciustolls. The typical soil profile
begins with a very dark grayish brown or dark grayish brown loam about 30 centimeters (cm; 12
inches [in]) deep and is underlain by a dark brown to brown loam from 30 to 53 cm (12 to 21 in)
below surface with common films and threads of calcium carbonate. This is followed by a series
of light yellowish brown to very pale brown, carbonate-rich loamy horizons to a depth of at least
183 cm (72 in; Soil Survey Staff 2010).

5

Branyon clay forms on nearly level to very gently sloping Pleistocene terraces within calcareous
clayey sediments. Gilgai microfeatures area commonly observed on undisturbed surfaces and
vertical cracks are often present for more than 90 days per year. Branyon soils are considered
moderately well drained, very slowly permeable, and are classified as fine, smectitic, thermic
Udic Haplusterts. A typical soil profile begins with a very dark gray to dark gray clay topsoil that
is approximately 30 cm (12 in) deep. Underlying the topsoil is a series of very dark gray to light
gray horizons with common vertic properties such as slickensides and wedge-shaped peds to a
depth of at least 203 cm (80 in). Although fine iron-manganese concretions can be found
throughout the profile, carbonate masses are restricted to only the lowest horizon (182 to 203 cm
[72 to 80 in]; Soil Survey Staff 2010).
Lewisville silty clay is mapped on the northern portion of the project area. The map unit is
commonly attributed to nearly level to rolling landscapes underlain by limestone. Similar to the
previous map units, Lewisville soils commonly form within Quaternary alluvium of mixed
sources. Lewisville soils are well drained and moderately permeable; and they are classified as
fine-silty, mixed, active, thermic Udic Calciustolls. The soil begins with a dark grayish brown
silty clay topsoil that is approximately 41 cm (16 in) thick. This is underlain by a series of
carbonate-rich dark grayish brown to brown B horizons to a depth of at least 157 cm (62 in; Soil
Survey Staff 2010).

CLIMATE
Bexar County has a modified subtropical climate. Winters are mild, with northerly winds
prevailing, and summers are hot, with southeasterly winds prevailing. Strong winds and heavy
rains occasionally occur as the result of tropical storms in the Gulf of Mexico. The San Antonio
area has an average of 265 frost-free days. The warmest months are May through October.
Temperatures rarely fall below -6.6 degrees Celsius (Â°C; 20Â° Fahrenheit [F]). The average daily
maximum and minimum temperatures for DecemberâJanuary range from about 4.4 to 15.5Â°C
(40â60Â°F), and from 21 to 35Â°C (70â95Â°F) for JulyâAugust (Taylor et al. 1966:102, 118â119,
Table 11).
Precipitation, about 70.86 cm (27.9 in) annually, is generally distributed throughout the year, with
the highest rainfalls occurring in May and September. Winter is the period of lowest
precipitation. Thunderstorms account for most of the rains from April through September. Light
hail often accompanies spring thunderstorms. Because of the presence of steep slopes, thin rocky
soils, and narrow valleys/canyons in the northwest, portions of Bexar County are subject to
flooding during heavy rainfalls. During the winter, snow is rare and most precipitation occurs as
light rains or drizzles. The average minimum and maximum monthly precipitation occurs during
November (about 3.6 cm [1.4 in]) and September (about 8.9 cm [3.5 in]), respectively (Taylor et
al. 1966:118, Table 11).

FLORA
As indicated previously, Bexar County is situated in a transitional zone between three
physiographic regions. Therefore, the flora is a mixture of three biotic provinces: the Balconian
(associated with the Edwards Plateau), the Texan (associated with the Blackland Prairie), and the
Tamaulipan (associated with the South Texas Coastal Plain) (Table 1). Each is represented to
varying degrees (Blair 1950).

Source: (Bogush 1952; Bray 1906; Inglis 1964)

Vegetation consists of mixed evergreen-deciduous woodlands along the edge of the escarpment,
grading into deciduous woodlands, and finally into forest in riparian and deep canyon settings.
Prior to European settlement, the vegetation setting along the southeastern border of the Edwards
Plateau was predominantly grasslands, with woodlands and forests limited to hillsides and deeply
incised limestone canyons (Weniger 1988). The mixture of grasslands and riparian forests, in
addition to the nearby Blackland Prairie, would have provided prehistoric and the earliest historic
inhabitants of the region with ample game and edible plant resources.

FAUNA
Bexar County is in a faunal transitional zone that is characterized by an intermixture of vertebrate
fauna from other biotic provinces: Austroriparian, Tamaulipan, Chihuahuan, and Dansan (Blair
1950:113â115). The mammals are represented by 57 species and none is restricted to the
Balconian province. Major mammalian fauna include the white-tailed deer, raccoon, coyote, fox,
bobcat, opossum, fox squirrel, eastern cottontail, black-tailed jackrabbit, beaver, eastern wood rat,
badger, skunk, river otter, and the extirpated pronghorn and bison (Blair 1950:113â114; Schmidly
1983). Important nonmammalian species consist of turkey, bobwhite, western box turtle,
snapping turtle, channel catfish, and sunfish (Blair 1950:113â115; Bull and Ferand 1977; Ernst
and Barbour 1972; Hubbs 1982; Schmidly 1983; Taylor et al. 1966:3â4). Most of these species
were of economic importance to prehistoric and the earliest historic populations of the region.

CHAPTER 3
CULTURAL CONTEXT

PREHISTORIC CHRONOLOGY (9500 B.C.âA.D. 1500)
The project area falls within the southern portion of the Central Texas archeological region. The
archeological record for Central Texas reflects the full North American cultural sequence;
therefore, evidence of human occupation spans a time period of roughly 12,000 years. The
Central Texas prehistoric cultural sequence presented in the following discussion is divided into
region-specific cultural-historical periods within four broad cultural stagesâPaleo-Indian,
Archaic, Late Prehistoric, and Historicâthat differentiate the broadly recognized North American
cultural trends (Table 2). These four major cultural stages are briefly summarized in the
following cultural history of the Central Texas area, which derives primarily from the work of
Black (1989), Collins (1995, 2004), Hester (2004), Prewitt (1981, 1985), Suhm (1960), Suhm et
al. (1954), and Weir (1976).

Paleo-Indian
The earliest widely accepted human occupation of North America is termed the Paleo-Indian
period (9500â6800 B.C.). Cooler, wetter conditions were in place at 10,000 B.C., and although a
general drying trend continued through Paleo-Indian times, climatic conditions were more stable
than during the subsequent Holocene. This cultural period is often characterized as a culture of
small but highly mobile bands of foragers who were specialized hunters of Pleistocene
megafauna. Most Paleo-Indian sites are deeply buried and difficult to find, leaving the highly
visible, but often fortuitously discovered, mammoth kill sites as the primary evidence of PaleoIndian life-ways. Recent studies address this bias and emphasize that large kills probably
contributed little to overall food requirements; rather, a primary reliance on other game animals
and plant resources was more likely (Ferring 1989). Subsistence in this period certainly included
large herbivores such as mammoth, bison, and horse, but was probably based more consistently
on smaller animals such as various species of turtle, land tortoise, alligator, mice, badger, and
raccoon (Collins et al. 1989; Story 1990) and, presumably, also included an array of plants
(Collins 1998). The defining Paleo-Indian trait is the fluted projectile point tradition. Projectile
points of the Early Paleo-Indian period were made from high quality toolstone and indicate high
technical skill in flaking, exhibiting a hallmark âflute,â which is a long, shallow flake scar that
extends from the base toward the tip of the point on one or both sides.
The Paleo-Indian stage in Texas, as across North America, is the earliest substantiated cultural
period. The Paleo-Indian stage in Central Texas falls into early and late subperiods, which
encompass three archeological complexes. The Llano and Folsom complexes comprise the Early
Paleo-Indian subperiod (9500â8000 B.C.), and the Late Paleo-Indian (8000â6800 B.C.) reflects the
Plano complex. These complexes are not unique to Central Texas, for their ranges extended into
the Southwest and Great Plains. The Early Paleo-Indian subperiod is based on two projectile
point styles: Clovis and Folsom.
The Llano complex is represented by the Clovis projectile point, the oldest point type found in
North America. Much research energy has been devoted to the makers of Clovis points, but the
material record of Llano peoples is largely limited to hunting activities. Clovis assemblages
include the diagnostic fluted lanceolate Clovis point, along with engraved stones, bone and ivory
points, stone bolas, and ochre (Collins 1995; Collins et al. 1992). Sites with Clovis components
reported in Central Texas include Kincaid Rockshelter, Wilson-Leonard, Gault, Horn Shelter 2,
Pavo Real (41BX52), and Crockett Gardens. Surface finds of distinctive Clovis points are
reported from a number of other localities (Meltzer and Bever 1995).
By about 9000 B.C. (11,000 years ago) the cool, wet climatic conditions of the Pleistocene had
given way to Holocene warming and drying. This change coincides with the extinction of
Pleistocene megafauna, most notably the mammoth, and is concurrent with the earliest record of
the Folsom complex. Like the Llano complex, the Folsom complex is best known for the Folsom
projectile point. Shorter than Clovis points, âclassicâ Folsom points exhibit fine parallel flaking
and large flutes that extend across most of each face. Midland points, commonly believed to
occur later in time, may represent unfluted Folsom points, apparently made to offset the
production risks involved in fluting (Amick 1995). Another trademark of the Folsom complex is
the association of Folsom points with the remains of now-extinct bison (Bison antiquus), usually
found in the context of massive kills of bison herds run into ravines. Such sites are conspicuous,
and thus much of what is known about Folsom subsistence and technology comes from lithic
artifacts found at these sites or nearby processing sites. Folsom tool kits consisted of the fluted
Folsom and the thin, unfluted (Midland) points, large thin bifaces, and end scrapers that were
more conducive to specialized hunting, particularly of Bison antiquus (Collins 1995:382).
10

By approximately 8000 B.C. (10,000 years ago), the climate trended toward more moderate
conditions, and the megafauna from the Early Paleo-Indian subperiod were no longer available.
Most of the associated faunal evidence dated to the Late Paleo-Indian Plano complex reflects a
human subsistence pattern based on deer and other smaller animals. Horn Shelter No. 2
(Forrester 1985) located on the Brazos River in Bosque County, Hinds Cave (Shafer and Bryant
1977) in Val Verde County, and Wilson-Leonard (Collins 1998) in Williamson County have
yielded subsistence data indicating that a variety of vertebrate fauna was consumed by the Late
Paleo-Indian peoples.
The Late Paleo-Indian Plano complex is represented by a greater diversity of projectile points
(e.g., Plainview, Angostura, Scottsbluff, and Golondrina), which, still in lanceolate form, were
unfluted. In contrast to evidence from the earlier subperiod, late subperiod points are associated
with modern bison (Bison bison) and often occur as surface finds throughout Central Texas. The
beginning of Prewittâs (1981) Early Archaic, or Circleville phase, is considered in this report as
the Late Paleo-Indian Plano complex but has also been called the âPre-Archaicâ (see Sollberger
and Hester 1972). The Late Paleo-Indian Plano complex defies convenient labeling, because it
exhibits a unique blend of lanceolate and stemmed points that appear to correspond with lifeways reflective of Archaic subsistence alongside Paleo-Indian mobility. Again, little is known
about the complex in Central Texas, but toward the latter part of the Late Paleo-Indian period,
lanceolate points began to be replaced by stemmed points. Settlement-subsistence strategies
probably more closely approximated those of the Archaic than Early Paleo-Indian. More diverse
sites are associated with this period, including not only the mass bison kills, which by the Late
Paleo-Indian period consist only of modern bison (Bison bison), but also campsites and
residences. The characteristics of the Wilson, Golondrina-Barber, and St. Maryâs Hall
components are more Archaic-like in that burned rock features are found, although the features
are much smaller and contain less rock that the burned rock features in the subsequent Archaic.

Archaic
Toward the end of the Late Paleo-Indian period, a great variety of projectile point styles began to
appear. The subsequent Archaic period (6800 B.C.âA.D. 750) is broadly characterized by
stemmed and side-notched dart points and by the appearance of ground and pecked stone tools.
The Archaic represents a more generalized style of hunting and gathering as a way of life, and the
subsistence pattern may have become more diffuse, reflecting a greater exploitation of local
environments as smaller game animals, fish, and wild plant foods increased in dietary importance.
Like their predecessors, Archaic peoples apparently continued to follow a nomadic way of life,
traveling seasonally to utilize different food resources in various localities (cf. Weir 1976).
McGraw and Hindes (1987:47) have noted that:
In northern and central Bexar County, major occupation sites are situated on stream terraces and are
usually associated with one or a series of spatially proximate, often buried, burned rock middens. An
extensive distribution of chipped stone debitage and a variety of diagnostic projectile points indicate
recurring occupations that span several thousand years. Major Late Prehistoric sites, in contrast, are
often physically discrete from these earlier sites.

The Archaic is generally divided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods (Black 1989; Collins
1995, 2004; Story 1985) based on diagnostic projectile point styles and associated radiocarbon
assays (Collins 1995, 2004). By the Middle Archaic in southern Central Texas, some regional
distinctiveness is apparent archeologically, as evidenced primarily by increased techno-stylistic
diversity among projectile point types. Interplay between influential factors of population
11

increase and environmental change toward greater aridity and climatic variability probably drove
adaptive change throughout the Archaic. The following discussion follows Storyâs (1985) broader
subdivisions of the Early, Middle, and Late Archaic, although Prewittâs (1981) discussion of
various phases within these periods provides much of the information discussed.
The most archeologically obvious changes from the Paleo-Indian to the Early Archaic (6800â
4000 B.C.) are the appearance of ground stone implements and the shift from the lanceolate points
of the Paleo-Indian tradition to the stemmed and side-notched dart points emblematic of the
Archaic. Three recognized point styles (Angostura, Early Split Stem [Gower and Jetta], and
Martindale-Uvalde) indicate that the makers tended to occupy the better-watered eastern part of
the Edwards Plateau (Collins 1998:65). Assemblages also include Clear Fork and Guadalupe
bifaces, manos, metates, hammerstones, burins, circular scrapers, and a variety of bifaces. Few
burials have been assigned to this period (Prewitt 1981:77â79; Story 1985:34â35), and
settlement/subsistence systems are âhypothesized to have been diffuse, utilizing a variety of
resources and frequently shifting the loci of subsistence activities rather than intensifying the use
of any specified resourceâ (Story 1985:39).
Projectile point types constitute the primary source of information about the Early Archaic, but
Prewitt (1981, 1985) uses point types to define four phases: the Circleville, San Geronimo,
Jarrell, and Oakalla. This refinement is questioned by some as unsubstantiated since few intact
sites are known (see Black 1989:26; Black and McGraw 1985), but the tendency for many Early
Archaic sites to occur around the Balcones Escarpment leads several researchers to infer that this
area was a refuge from drier conditions in Central Texas and on the coastal plains (McKinney
1981; Story 1985). Concentrations of Early Archaic sites along the southern and eastern margins
of the Edwards Plateau may be indicative of climatic conditions at the time, as these
environments had more reliable water sources and a diverse subsistence base. The margins of the
Edwards Plateau are ecotonal in character and may have provided reliable resources during times
of environmental stress (Story 1985:31, 34). Convincing paleoenvironmental data on the climatic
conditions of this period is, nonetheless, still lacking.
Early Archaic sites are small (Weir 1976:115â122), suggesting that populations were highly
mobile and that their densities were low (Prewitt 1985:217). Early Archaic sites are usually
described as open campsites (such as Loeve, Wilson-Leonard, Richard Beene, Sleeper, Jetta
Court, Youngsport, Camp Pearl Wheat, and Landslide) or lithic procurement stations. Only a few
campsites located in rockshelters (e.g., Kincaid Rockshelter) occur on the Edwards Plateau during
this period. The location of lithic procurement sites is determined by the natural distribution of
cherts. Large and varied burned-rock features (Sleeper, Camp Pearl Wheat, Wilson-Leonard,
Richard Beene) become common in the latter part of the Early Archaic, and domestic structures
(Turkey Bend Ranch) and caches (Linder) are also known in the Early Archaic (Collins 1998:64).
Freshwater mussel, deer, and small game appear to have been important food resources. Hearths
are occasionally found at Early Archaic sites and can be stone-lined, basin-shaped, or flat. The
appearance of ground stone signifies a shift to plant resources, and the diversification of lithic
technology appears to reflect an increased reliance on gathering.
The Middle Archaic (4000â2000 B.C.) marks the first period of Central Texas distinctiveness as
an archeological region. The subperiod exhibits more numerous and more varied sites than the
preceding Early Archaic. This cultural manifestation is characterized by a population increase;
the development of regionally distinct cultural patterns; and changes in settlement patterns,
economic and social systems, and technology (Prewitt 1985). In addition, territorial boundaries
may have begun to emerge (Story 1985:39).
12

Burned-rock middens, which often consist of massive amounts of fire-cracked limestone, are,
however, the preeminent archeological features of the Middle Archaic. Many of these middens
may represent earthen ovens used to process live oak acorns (see Weir 1976), as well as for
roasting succulents or other plants and animals. Many Central Texas tree species disappeared
from the paleoenvironmental record at this time, leaving live oak forests to dominate the
landscape. A renewed focus on deer, which themselves were well suited for the oak-savanna
environment, is likely. Weir (1976:124â130) suggests that an expansion of oak forests influenced
the development of an economic system that focused on the exploitation of deer, acorns, and
other hardwood nuts. Prewitt (1985:222â226) notes that the abundance of rock middens indicates
a greater reliance on plant foods, although tool kits still imply a strong reliance on hunting.
Middle Archaic sites in Central Texas are represented by rockshelters, campsites, lithic quarries,
and kill sites (Weir 1976), as well as by the burned-rock middens that first appeared toward the
end of the Early Archaic. Other features include basin hearths and large flat hearths. Data
concerning mortuary practices are few except for the end of the Middle Archaic, for which
cremations have been reported (Prewitt 1981:81). Three generalized point styles characterize this
subperiod: Bell-Andice-Calf Creek, Taylor, and Nolan-Travis. Bifaces, a variety of scrapers,
unifaces, and grinding stones are also present. Prewitt (1981:73) suggests that the proportion of
projectile points (50 percent) compared to total number of tools is indicative of a balance between
the exploitation of plant and animal resources.
Late Archaic (2000 B.C.âA.D. 750) life-ways began similarly to those of the Middle Archaic, but
notable changes occurred, characterized by the emergence of new cultural patterns as well as the
intensification of preexisting ones (Story 1985:45). Coastal marine shells, used either as
ornaments or as raw materials for ornaments, were exchanged with inland groups, at least on a
limited basis, in return for finished lithic tools and/or siliceous raw material (Story 1985:48). The
use of burned-rock middens throughout the Late Archaic appears to have been a major part of the
subsistence strategy because a decrease in the importance of hunting, inferred from the low ratio
of projectile points in relation to other tools in site assemblages, may have occurred (Prewitt
1981:74). Bison, which had been absent from the area for most of the Archaic, were however
once again available in the region (Dillehay 1974).
Late Archaic sites include rockshelters, campsites, and large cemeteries. The establishment of
these large cemeteries along drainages suggests strong territorial ties by certain groups (Story
1985:40). Cemeteries, burial sites where at least two individuals were buried in proximity, imply
repeated use of space for the burial of a group of peopleâs dead. The location and use of the
larger cemeteries are believed to be the result of the same cultural group using a place on the
landscape to reaffirm their rights of descent and control/access to critical resources (see
discussion in Taylor 1998 and Taylor et al. 1995:627â631).
Late Archaic cemeteries in South and Central Texas exhibit a significant energy investment and
often contain mortuary furniture. When artifacts are found in burial contexts, they represent
discrete points in time, or part of the package of tools or objects that would have been used during
a particular occupation period. Burial artifacts, then, provide the unique opportunity to glimpse
an assemblage that may not be possible in other site contexts where multiple occupations may be
overprinted, as is common in terrace settings. From general ethnographic studies of huntergatherer groups, it is suspected that grave goods represent a sampling of utilitarian and
ornamental items used and possessed in life by those individuals, hinting at the social status and
personae of the deceased (Binford 1971), and a recognition that such burial goods would be
needed in the deceasedâs next life (Perttula 2001).
13

In Central Texas, on the Edwards Plateau, burials in sinkholes and caves appear to be relatively
common (Kibler 2001). Below the escarpment, however, cemeteries are found along river
drainages and often contain mortuary goods. There appears to be an association of deer antler
and deer antler racks in late Middle Archaic and Late Archaic mortuary contexts. Evidence of
this association is primarily based on items recovered from large burials in riverine settings at
such sites as Loma Sandia (41LK28) in Live Oak County, Olmos Dam (41BX1) in the Blackland
Prairie below the Edwards Plateau escarpment in Bexar County, and Ernest Witte (41AU36)
along the lower Brazos River in Austin County (Perttula 2001).
Other features found at Late Archaic sites include basin hearths, arcuate hearths, earth ovens, and
mussel shell caches. The lithic assemblages contain a variety of dart point styles (e.g., Bulverde,
Pedernales-Kinney, Lange-Williams-Marshall, Marcos-Montell-Castroville, Ensor-Frio-Fairland,
and Darl); Erath, San Gabriel, and Hare bifaces; gravers; scrapers; a variety of unifaces and
bifaces; grinding stones; and boatstones. Except for Montell and Fairland, the point styles for the
Late Archaic are among the most widely distributed dart points (Prewitt 1985). Other artifacts
include ulna flakers, bone beads and awls, stone and marine shell gorgets, and freshwater mussel
shell pendants (Prewitt 1981:81â82).

Late Prehistoric
The Late Prehistoric period (A.D. 750â1500) is marked by the replacement of atlatl-and-dart with
bow-and-arrow technology. Ceramics were also adopted within this period. Basin-shaped and
flat hearths and burned clay/charcoal lenses and pits are the predominant archeological features.
There is a continuation of Late Archaic burial practices, with flexed and semi-flexed burials
occurring near habitation sites, usually in cemeteries but also as isolated occurrences. Some
burials were cremations, carried away from cemeteries and placed in shallow pits.
The period is divided into two main periods, the Austin (A.D. 750â1200) and Toyah (A.D. 1200â
1500), and each is marked by distinctive cultural traits. Once believed to be contemporaneous,
Jelksâs (1953, 1962) work at the Blum Rockshelter and the Kyle site demonstrated the temporal
separation between Austin and Toyah components by locating stratigraphically distinct Perdiz
arrow points above older Austin phase Scallorn arrow points. The Late Prehistoric chronology of
southern Texas is closely aligned with that of Central Texas, particular in terms of Toyah cultural
manifestations (Hester 1995:443).
The Austin phase is characterized by a shift to the use of the bow and arrow. Common are
Scallorn and other related side-notched (e.g., Edwards) arrow points, as well as broad-based
hunting and gathering as the main mode of subsistence (Turner and Hester 1999:173). Common
artifacts for this period include numerous bifaces, Clear Fork gouges, scrapers, and grinding
stones. Typical features included basin hearths, pits, and cemeteries. The interments at Austin
phase cemeteries such as Loeve-Fox (41WM230; Prewitt 1974, 1981) and the Coleman site
(41BX568; Potter et al. 2005) show evidence of increased nutritional stress and social violence.
In addition, the mortuary program followed by Austin phase populations appears to contrast with
that of the preceding Late Archaic period peoples of the area (Potter et al. 2005). There is less
investment in mortuary goods or personal adornment during this phase, and the antlers that occur
in numerous Late Archaic cemeteries are poorly represented in Late Prehistoric cemeteries.

14

The broad-based subsistence patterns of the Austin phase focused largely on gathering, though
hunting of deer along with exploitation of freshwater mussels and snails is also suggested to have
been important (Prewitt 1981:83; Ricklis and Collins 1994). The diagnostic projectile points of
the Austin period are the Scallorn and Granbury. Austin phase components have been found at
sites along waterways throughout Bexar County (e.g., Cibolo Creek [sites 41BX379, 41BX746,
41BX1005], Salado Creek [sites 41BX699, 41BX1007, 41BX1433]), the San Antonio River [site
41BX567] and the Medina River [sites 41BX1076, 41BX1104]) (Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas). Friday bifaces and unifaces, other bifaces, scrapers, ground stone, ulna flakers, and bone
awls are among the wide variety of tools. Other artifacts include painted stones, bone beads, and
marine shell beads and pendants. Projectile points are proportionately more common during the
Austin phase as hunting appears to have become increasingly important. The widespread
occurrence of Scallorn points outside of Central Texas and the frequency of marine shell indicate
a broad cultural entity and/or extensive trade networks in the Late Prehistoric.
The Toyah phase is the best known of the Late Prehistoric phases. It is distinct from the
preceding Austin phase and is marked archeologically by Perdiz and similar contracting-stem
arrow points, pottery, beveled-edge bifacial knives, perforators, and end scrapers (Black 1986,
1989, Creel 1991; Hester 1980, 1995; Jelks 1962; Johnson 1994; Kelley 1986; Prewitt 1981).
Perishable artifacts such as cordage and basketry are found at some sites. Corncobs have also
been recovered, indicating either trade relations with agricultural peoples or some degree of
horticulture (Prewitt 1981:74). Extensive trade relations are also indicated by the presence of
Caddo ceramics, such as Bullard Brushed, among other imported types. Toyah phase burials
sometimes contain artifacts, but it is not established that these are grave goods. Perdiz and
Cliffton points found in burials may be from fatal wounds and indicative of increased conflict.
Sites in Bexar County associated with the Toyah phase have been recorded in Government
Canyon (e.g., 41BX133, 41BX141) and along Cibolo Creek (41BX372), the Medina River
(41BX528), and Culebra Creek (41BX1422, 41BX1423) (Texas Archeological Sites Atlas).
During the Toyah phase, a climatic shift to moister conditions allowed the savannas and
grasslands to advance, bringing the return of the bison. Subsistence strategies shifted even further
toward hunting in response to the reoccupation of Central Texas by bison (Dillehay 1974). Deer,
however, probably continued to be an important resource (Black and McGraw 1985). The
importance of bison to the Toyah economy is readily deduced from the makeup of artifact
assemblages represented at a number of archeological sites. The Buckhollow site (41KM16)
produced an abundance of Perdiz arrow points of many varieties (Johnson 1994). Also found
were Harahey knives, most of them containing four beveled edges. The knife use wear is
representative of cutting bison hides and fleshâa hypothesis supported by the recovery of large
numbers of bison bones. Also indicative of the importance of bison is the recovery of large end
scrapers from the site. The presence of edge rounding and polish on bit ends indicates use on
fresh hides, most of which were probably bison (Johnson 1994). The Hinojosa site (41JW8),
located in Jim Wells County in southern Texas, represents a Late Prehistoric Toyah base camp
dating from A.D. 1300â1500 (Black 1986). Specialized hunting adaptations are evident from the
archeological materials, though a broad subsistence base of fish, soft-shell turtle, aquatic birds,
and mussel shell was also exploited. Deer figured prominently in the overall assemblage, with
bison and pronghorn antelope also contributing a significant portion to overall subsistence (Black
1986). A major component of the highly adaptive bison-oriented Toyah phase tool kit is the end
scraper used for processing hides. Creel (1991) has suggested that these tools are indicative of
the importance of trade in bison hides during the Late Prehistoric and Early Historic periods.
Bison bones occur in great frequency in many Late Prehistoric Toyah phase sites. Excavations at
41LK201 and 41MC222 along the Frio River drainage contained abundant bison bone, with the
latter site dating to around A.D. 1260â1290 (Hester 1980; Highley 1986).

Historic Native American
The historic period (post-A.D. 1500) in Central Texas represents the local expression of sweeping
cultural change for native peoples across North America. Spanish missionization corresponds to
the first European influence in Texas, but it probably did not have dramatic effects until the 1600s
when native groups sought refuge at the missions from encroaching Apache and, later, Comanche
groups. Changes through gradual cultural adoption and exchange of Spanish life-ways and
materials occurred throughout the seventeenth century. After the 1700s, European material
culture became pervasive. Metal, glass, European clothing, and guns became important to native
peoples, replacing traditional items.
The early history of southern and Central Texas is the most richly documented in the state. The
numerous expeditions into these parts of the region resulted in records and journals that provide
sparse glimpses into the past of the native peoples. Nevertheless, limited ethnographic cultural
data exist for the native groups that occupied this immediate area preceding the establishment of
the missions. Campbell and Campbell (1996) present a list of the groups occupying Mission San
Juan and Mission Espada, as well as the other missions in the area. For many of the groups
listed; however, original territorial ranges can only be speculated, and their material culture
cannot be differentiated from other groups residing in the missions at the time. In the nineteenth
century, the term âCoahuiltecan,â for Coahuilteco, was coined by a Mexican linguist for a related
group of native languages in the region (Campbell and Campbell 1996:17). The name came from
the Mexican state of Coahuila, which included the northern part of New Spain and most of the
area occupied by present-day Texas. Over the last century, the term Coahuiltecan was widely
adopted for use in referring to the whole of the native groups living on the southern Texas plains
region and into Mexico. Although the term originally described a group of related languages, it
devolved into a common misinterpretation that was applied to a widespread ethnically related
culture believed to speak the same Coahuiltecan language. This terminology was far from
correct. In fact, the people who were subsumed under this umbrella term represented distinct
ethnic groups with distinct cultures and diverse languages and dialects (Hester 1998).
Few Historic Native American archeological sites have been investigated in the San
Antonio/Bexar County area. Supposed sites relating to the historic Indian contact period are
usually characterized by multiple components that span a long period of time. Since the historic
Indian period lasted only roughly 200 years, the material evidence occurs at shallow depths below
surface or entirely on the surface. Consequently, it is prone to modern disturbance. Stratigraphic
separation between the Late Prehistoric and Historic Native American contact components is
often limited or nonexistent. Excavations at site 41MC296, a historic native encampment on Elm
Creek in McMullen County, illustrate that European trade items were introduced to the South
Texas native peoples in advance of the Spanish entrada. Conversely, at the Olmos Dam site
(41BX1) in Bexar County, historic-era seasonal encampments made by native peoples traveling
the âPeyote Trailâ to northern Mexico were documented as late as the 1920s (Lukowski 1988).
Numerous river crossing sites with possible contact period components were identified during
historical research and survey for the Applewhite Reservoir in San Antonio. They include the
Dolores/Perez/Applewhite Crossing (41BX682); Pampopa/Paso del Talon (41BX680), one of the
documented crossings used by Native Americans prior to Spanish use; Sabinitas/Jett/Palo Alto
Crossing (41BX857); and Paso de las Garzas (41BX697) (Hindes 1992). Archeological
investigations were conducted at the Pampopa-Talon crossing site (41BX528), where important
roads connecting San Antonio to points along the Rio Grande pass over the Medina River.
16

Between 1731 and 1737, the Pampopa fled mission confinement and were pursued to their
rancherias near the âOld Fordâ of the Medina River. Historic accounts tell of encampments of
the Pampopa and other Indian groups nearby (Thoms and Ahr 1995). The Pampopa
Crossing/Ford has been positively identified at sites 41BX527 and 41BX528 on the Medina
River.

HISTORIC CHRONOLOGY (A.D. 1500sâEARLY 1900s)

Spanish Exploration and Settlement
The initial European presence in Texas occurred in 1519 when Ãlvarez de PiÃ±eda mapped the
coastline of Texas under the order of Francisco Garay, then governor of Jamaica. PiÃ±eda laid
claim to all the land between Florida and the Rio Grande in the name of the Spanish Crown. His
explorations were followed by those of Alvar NÃºÃ±ez Cabeza de Vaca in the 1530s. Cabeza de
Vaca was a member of the 1527â1528 expedition of PÃ¡nfilo de NarvÃ¡ez, a large expedition
charged with surveying much of the land in the southeastern United States. While inland, the
NarvÃ¡ez group became separated from the ships. Because of hostile Indians and food shortages,
NarvÃ¡ez led his men in improvised watercrafts along the Gulf of Mexico coastline, hoping to
reach the PÃ¡nuco River. A hurricane destroyed most of the group, but shipwrecked a few of the
men, including Cabeza de Vaca, on the Texas coast, probably on present-day Galveston Island, in
1528. De Vaca lived among the coastal Indians for the next eight years. After being enslaved by
hostile Indians, he eventually made his escape, arriving at a Mexican outpost to the west in 1536.
He was the first non-Indian to wander through the Texas region, and his writings about his travels
were the first accounts of the area, generating excitement over the prospect of gold and leading to
subsequent Spanish expeditions to the region in search of the precious commodity. Soon,
Spanish authorities commissioned Francisco VÃ¡zquez de Coronado, governor of the Mexican
province of Nueva Galicia, to lead an expedition into the American Southwest in 1540 in search
of the fabled Seven (Golden) Cities of Cibola to the north (Fehrenbach 1968:23). The expedition
was a dismal failure in its attempt to find the legendary gold, but did succeed in exploring some
of Texas and New Mexico. In 1539, Hernando de Sotoâs expedition landed in present-day
Florida and over the next four years traveled across the southeastern United States. After de
Sotoâs death at the Mississippi River, Luis de Moscoso de Alvarado took command of the
expedition. By 1542, the Moscoso group had traveled as far west as Texas (Hester 1989:199) in
an attempt to reach New Spain (present-day Mexico).
As it became apparent that there were no cities of gold to exploit, settlement was somewhat
slowed until French interest in the region stimulated the Spanish to renew their colonizing efforts.
After word came in 1685 that Rene-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, had established an outpost
somewhere on the Texas coast, the Spanish were motivated to send various expeditions to locate
and eradicate the outpost. The threat that the French presented became almost an obsession with
the Spanish:
The specter of French invasion brooded over the Spanish colony in New Mexico for nearly two centuries.
Somewhereâperhaps from the wilds of New France, perhaps from the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, at
some incalculable distanceâan indeterminable number of Frenchman were periodically thought to
threaten the silver mines of New Spain. . . . Beset with internal problems, woefully conscious of their
weakness and isolation, New Mexicans started at the very shadow of intruders on the vague periphery of
their province [John 1975:155].
17

This attitude encouraged the establishment of missions and presidios in East Texas to buffer
against further French encroachment into the region (Fox 1989:85).
Alonso de LeÃ³n mounted various expeditions into Texas between 1686 and 1690. In 1691,
Domingo TerÃ¡n was appointed governor of the province. He, accompanied by Padre Massanet,
set out to determine what French activities were occurring in the region and to establish a series
of missions among the Indians. In this pursuit, they came into the region of San Antonio, both
commenting on the fine plains and large numbers of buffalo they encountered (McGraw and
Hindes 1987:64). Padre Massanet called the area âSan Antonio de Paduaâ in honor of St.
Anthony of Padua and suggested that it would make a suitable location for a mission. A small
garrison of men was left there, and the Presidio of San Antonio de BÃ©xar was initiated (McGraw
and Hindes 1987:64). At least one source believes that the site of the presidio was initially called
âthe âlevel lands without woodsâ which . . . de TerÃ¡n and Massanet crossed when they continued
their journeyâ (Habig 1968:160).
Activities in the area were curtailed during the Eleven Yearsâ War of Spanish Succession (1702â
1713); but when the Frenchman Louis Juchereau de St. Denis traveled over much of the province
undetected in 1714, the Spanish were galvanized into action. A series of missions was planned
throughout the frontier areas of New Spain. For example, in 1716, an expedition led by Captain
Domingo RamÃ³n set out for East Texas to establish missions and a presidio, including one at a
site between the Red and Sabine rivers at Los Adaes (de la Teja 1988:51â51).
In response to the remoteness of the settlements in East Texas, the Spanish soon recognized that a
âway-stationâ was necessary to bridge the distance between the newly settled missions and San
Juan Bautista on the Rio Grande. The need for an intermediate location had been evident for
some time, and âTerÃ¡n . . . considered the upper San Antonio River valley, with its abundant
water supply, woods and agricultural land, the ideal site for missions and townsâ (de la Teja
1988:53). Of like mind was Fray Antonio de San Buenaventura Olivares who had been
impressed with the area during his visit in 1709. MartÃ­n de AlarcÃ³n, who had been recently
appointed governor to the province, considered the opinions. It was decided that two missions
were to be founded: one on the San Antonio River and one on the San Colorado River, with the
former established first. The viceroy ordered not only missionaries and solders to populate the
new missions, but settlers and families, artisans, and livestock as well (de la Teja 1988:55).
The three-pronged approach that the Spanish used for settlementâwhich included presidio,
mission, and civilian settlementsâproved to be more successful than the establishment of
mission and presidio or presidio alone (Gilmore 1991). This was certainly true in the case of San
Antonio. On May 1, 1718, a group led by AlarcÃ³n and including Fray Olivares founded the
Mission San Antonio de Valero on San Pedro Creek, and on May 5, 1718, the presidio and the
villa of San Antonio de BÃ©xar were established. Although ceremonially the city was founded in
1718, no actual construction was begun until 1719 due to the lack of men and materials (McGraw
and Hindes 1987:66).
A total of five missions was eventually built on the San Antonio River, all within a 12-mile radius
of the present city of San Antonio. They are, in order of establishment: Mission San Antonio de
Valero (1718), Mission San JosÃ© (1720), Mission Nuestra SeÃ±ora de la PurÃ­sima ConcepciÃ³n
(1731), Mission San Juan de Capistrano (1731), and Mission San Francisco de la Espada (1731).
The last three had initially been established in East Texas, but were relocated to the San Antonio
River area. All of the missions in present-day San Antonio were administered by the order of
18

Saint Francis. Mission San JosÃ© was under the authority of the College of Zacatecas, and the
remaining four were under the authority of the College of QuerÃ©taro. In 1773, all the San
Antonio missions were placed under the auspices of the College of Zacatecas (Jackson 1986:33).
Each ministered to different groups of Indians.
During the early 1700s, population growth was slow in the San Antonio area. Initially, most
inhabitants were members of military households. AlarcÃ³nâs first settlement had included âan
engineer, stone mason, blacksmith, and a number of women and childrenâ (de la Teja 1988:56).
Fray Celiz, the chronicler of the AlarcÃ³n expedition, noted that the first attempts in 1718 to locate
settlement sites were unsuccessful. A stable water supply for the missions was necessary for both
crop production and human and animal consumption. Because of the relatively arid San Antonio
environment, the missions needed an effective way to enhance the available water supply. The
Franciscans adopted a system of irrigation ditchesâcalled acequiasâintroduced into Spain by
Moslems, and began construction in 1719 on a 15-mile network of seven gravity-flow ditches,
five dams, and an aqueduct to distribute water to about 3,500 acres of cultivated land (National
Park Service [NPS] 2005). The acequias are, in order of construction: ConcepciÃ³n/Pajalache
(1791), Alamo Madre (1724), San JosÃ© (1730), San Juan (1731), Espada (1731), San Pedro (ca.
1738), and Alazan (1872) (Guerra 1987:17â21). Once the first of the acequias was operational,
settlers âexpected a large crop of maize, beans, and other produceâ (de la Teja 1988:57).
By 1721, San Antonio had become a series of wood and mud huts (jacales), typical of a Spanish
frontier settlement. All settlers, both military and civilian, were dependent on the garrison for
defense, communications, and, initially, civil administration. The missions of San Antonio
attracted a variety of Indian groups, primarily Coahuiltecan and Karankawan hunter-gatherers,
during the mid 1700s, but also attracted Indians of other origins, some of whom were fleeing
Spanish disruptions in Nuevo LeÃ³n and other regions of northern Mexico (Hester 1989:200).
However, not all Indian groups were interested in what the missions had to offer:
When our arms were first introduced in Texas, our foremost object was the propagation of faith, by the
means of evangelic predication; but, notwithstanding the endeavors and apostolic zeal of the Reverend
Missionaries, we could not succeed in gathering the Indians around the Missions. Used to a roving and
unrestrained life, the Nations of that extended territory refused to submit to the merciful yoke of the
Church, finding it rather burdensome, owning to their depraved habits. Unable to attract them to us of
their own free will, we never availed ourselves of force. . . . [Buquor 1935:2].

Mission settlements were disrupted frequently from 1721 to 1749 by raiding Apaches. Even after
a formal truce had been signed in 1749, thievery and limited hostilities took place throughout the
rest of the century (de la Teja 1988:61). Hostilities also were occurring with various Comanche
bands, who disapproved of the tentative link between the Spanish and the Apache during the last
half of the 1700s.
At the expense of the Spanish Crown, colonists from the Canary Islands had been sent to colonize
other areas with great success. The harsh economic conditions that existed on the islands,
coupled with the promise of land, made the islanders eager emigrants (de la Teja 1988:67). On
March 9, 1731, a group of colonists from the Canary Islands came to the area and were to have a
profound effect on the region. As originally conceived, an additional 400 islander families would
immigrate into the region. When it became apparent that this endeavor would be too costly, the
idea was abandoned and no additional families were ever recruited (de la Teja 1988:68). The
Canary Islanders were given control over lands previously allotted to the military settlers. They
also were given control over the town council and effectively barred established settlers from
19

participating in local government (de la Teja 1988:68). Eventually, local elections took place in
which the sitting council elected its successors. Although these elections were full of
irregularities, in the end they did provide a means by which new settlers could share in town
government.
Initially, town lots were only distributed among Canary Islanders. The distribution of land to the
islanders involves the first record of the San Antonio Town Tract (on which the city proper is
located). Captain Juan Antonio PÃ©rez de AlmazÃ¡n, who served as commander and superior
justice (justicia mayor) of San Antonio, began to lay the tract for the town of San Antonio in
1731. He had to work around the existing presidio and missions (de la Teja 1988:122) because,
in general, the land west of San Pedro Creek was considered less desirable because of its
vulnerability to Indian attack.
Population growth in the area continued at a steady rate due to a variety of factors and in part to
established access into the region via El Camino Real, also known as the Kingâs Highway or the
Old San Antonio Road. This âroadâ was not one fixed route, but one that altered with the season
and the year. San Antonio de BÃ©xar, as an established way-station, became a hub for the various
routes (McGraw and Hindes 1987).
Land use outside of BÃ©xar during the Spanish period was chiefly confined to large-scale ranching
activities. Ranching during the eighteenth century was very relaxed. Round-ups amounted to
little more than the gathering of wild, unbranded stock when meat or hide and tallow were needed
(McGraw and Hindes 1987:71). This lax attitude can be attributed primarily to the small
population and the lack of markets. However, some ranches in what is today Bexar County were
more productive (McGraw and Hindes 1987:72).
Outside political factors during the latter half of the eighteenth century had a great impact on the
region. The completion of the Seven Yearsâ War (1754â1762) and the signing of the Treaty of
Paris in 1763 resulted in the French and Spanish ceding most of the lands east of the Mississippi
River to England, and Spain acquiring the Louisiana Territory from France. This, of course, put
an end to the years of Spanish paranoia and called for a reassessment of the situation in New
Spain (McGraw and Hindes 1987:74). Local effects included the selection of BÃ©xar as the new
provincial capital.
The American Revolution encouraged economic growth in the region. Cattle from the ranches in
the BÃ©xar area were rounded up for sale in Louisiana to the Spanish who were fighting the British
along the Gulf Coast (McGraw and Hindes 1987). Another change in the region was the
beginning secularization of the missions by 1794. Secularizationâthe transition from mission
status into secular Spanish society, based on official royal decreeâwas in part a result of the
missionsâ decline in status as a response to the removal of the French threat. The second factor in
secularization was the decline of the missionsâ indigenous inhabitants in the 1790s as those
populations assimilated into Spanish society, achieving a major goal of the mission system,
through intermarriage or conversion to Christianity. Pressure from the surrounding civilians for
mission farmland (labores) increased as mission populations fell, and eventually secularization
was complete by 1824 as the last of the labores were privatized, divided, and distributed among
the remaining mission Indians and the local population (Reese 1995:K-9; Spanish Missions
2001).

20

Political events continued to have a rapid impact on the region. The Louisiana Purchase in 1803
brought about the establishment of a âno-manâs landâ between the Texas and Louisiana border.
Both Spain and America were eager to avoid a costly war. The Louisiana Purchase, however, did
generate increased American interest in Texas. Many from the former French province were
eager to emigrate:
In view of the fact that the said province has been retroceded to the French Republic and they have sold it
to the United States of America, numerous noble, influential, and rich families, as well as some poor
ones, desire to move to the provinces under your command in order that they might live under the
Spanish flag and enjoy the same kind treatment that they, as well as their predecessors, have previously
enjoyed. . . . the universal love and loyalty felt for the Spanish government is so great that we are satisfied
and believe there will be more than a thousand families, more than two hundred of them of the Spanish
nation, who will come as soon as they sell their lands . . . [Hatcher 1934:278].

This kind of attitude was not, however, prevalent throughout the Spanish colonies. Growing
discontent with Spanish rule (which had been rapidly deteriorating) in the provinces resulted in
10 bitter years of strife, beginning in 1810 and culminating with Mexican Independence in 1821.
These years had a profound effect in the region of what is today San Antonio. Filibusterers,
encouraged by the claim that Texas was actually American territory, made forays into the
province. In addition, battles were waged between Spanish loyalists and revolutionaries, and
control of San Antonio de BÃ©xar changed back and forth several times. In a particularly bloody
incident, 1,000 persons in the province who were, or were accused of being, revolutionaries were
rounded up and executed or exiled. Much of the improved farmland around BÃ©xar was left
fallow, and the town itself was almost abandoned because of the scarcity of food (Fehrenbach
1968:130).

Mexican Statehood
The period following Mexican Independence brought a slow improvement in the conditions
around San Antonio de BÃ©xar. Beginning in 1823, immigration laws were changed to allow
empresarios to offer lands to heads of families willing to settle in Texas. The policy had been
initially investigated by the Spanish as a means of securing its territory and providing a buffer
zone against Indian attack. In fact, Moses Austin had applied for and received permission to
bring American colonists to Texas in 1821, before Mexican Independence (Fehrenbach
1968:135). Austin had been granted the right to settle 300 families in Texas, but he never saw his
grant. By the time he returned to his home in Missouri, his health had broken, and before his
death he only had time to beg his son Stephen to carry out his plans (Fehrenbach 1968:136).
Stephen F. Austin willingly followed in his fatherâs footsteps, and because of the liberal land
policies, first of Spain and later of Mexico, he had many eager volunteers ready to accompany
him. Colonists had to be of good moral character and were required to become Spanish (then
Mexican) citizens. They were also required to convert to Catholicism, although this requirement
was not rigorously enforced. Under Spanish/Mexican law, land was distributed as follows: one
labor (177 acres) to each family engaged in farming, one league (4,428 acres) to each family
engaged in ranching, and one-third league (1,461 acres) to each single rancher (Fehrenbach
1968:140). The government charged a flat title fee, and Austin received a fee. The law required
the land to be developed in two years or be forfeited. In all, 297 titles were issued, and only
seven were forfeited. Most of the settlers claimed to be ranchers for obvious reasons.
21

In San Antonio de BÃ©xar, local politics were affected by the Mexican Constitution of 1824.
Former Spanish provinces were turned into sovereign states, and Texas and Coahuila were
combined into one state with Saltillo named as its capital. The legislature of Coahuila passed its
own colonization laws in 1825. This continued to open up the area to Euro-American settlement,
and in all, there were some 26 empresarios in colonial Texas.
After a decade of empresarios, over 20,000 Euro-Americans, with their slaves, were in Texas.
The impact of this can be understood when realizing that the empresarios managed to settle more
of Texas in a decade than the government of Spain had settled in three centuries.
One of the effects of increased immigration was the opening and improvement of roadways,
many of which followed the earlier Spanish caminos. The influx of settlers into the region
brought changes in local politics as well, with Anglo-American immigrants gaining more power.
In many areas of Texas, Mexicans were becoming politically overshadowed by the new
immigrants. This situation alarmed the Mexican government, who passed the Decree of April 6,
1830, prohibiting the further âcolonization of Mexican territory by citizens of adjacent
countriesâmeaning the United Statesâ (Fehrenbach 1968:165). This decree also prohibited the
importation of slaves and further alienated the Anglo-American settlers.
From 1832 to 1835, a series of conflicts and temporary solutions continued to drive a wedge
between Texas and Mexico. When the Texans met in San Felipe de Austin in 1835, they adopted
resolutions and framed a state convention (to form a separate state from Coahuila). Shortly
afterward, when it became known that a Mexican army under Presidente Antonio LÃ³pez de Santa
Anna had crossed the Rio Grande bound for San Antonio de BÃ©xar to squelch the rebellious
Texans, a call to arms was issued, and hostilities were begun in earnest (Fehrenbach 1968:193).
Many of the conflicts of what would come to be known as the Texas Revolution were fought in
and around the modern city of San Antonio. These engagements culminated in the battle at the
Alamo (formerly Mission San Antonio de Valero) in the spring of 1836. At the same time that
the Alamo was under siege, elected representatives of the Texans were meeting at Washingtonon-the-Brazos, and on March 2, 1836, the Texas Declaration of Independence was signed. After
his victory at the Alamo, Santa Annaâs forces were defeated by the Texans at the Battle of San
Jacinto, and the Republic of Texas was born.

Texas Republic
In 1836, the Republic of Texas was a âbackwaterâ with about 40,000 residents, most of whom
were subsistence farmers. When elections were first held in 1836, the Texans voted
overwhelmingly to approve a union with the United States, but the issue of slavery stood in the
way of annexation for 10 years.
The government of the new republic was a loosely organized affair. Among the many problems
facing the new republic was the fact that â[t]here was no money economy, nor any money. There
were no banks or improved roads or organized schools. There was no industryâeverything from
pins to powder had to be imported from the United Statesâ (Fehrenbach 1968:247). The Texans
quickly replaced the old Spanish/Mexican conventions with the more familiar American ones.

22

Bexar County was formed in 1836, with a population that was predominantly Mexican.
However, the new republic was eager to encourage immigration, and it did so by offering its most
abundant commodityâland. Travelers across the region wrote enthusiastic letters back home.
Texas is certainly one of the finest countries in the world, the salubrity of her climate and the luxuriance
of her soil is beyond doubt unparalleled in the known world,âhere it seems to be one perpetual spring
[Hale 1836].

Under the Republic of Texas Constitution, settlers fell into one of three classes, which dictated
the disbursal of land:
First Classâarrived before March 2, 1836
Heads of Household: one league and one labor (4,428 acres and 177 acres)
Single Man: one-third league (1,461 acres)
Second Classâarrived between March 2, 1836, and October 1, 1837
Heads of Household: 1,280 acres
Single Man: 640 acres
Third Classâarrived between October 1, 1837, and January 1, 1840
Heads of Household: 640 acres
Single Man: 320 acres.
The new settler to Texas had to find unclaimed land on his own and often would not be able to
procure land in his county of residency. The responsibility for providing witnesses who could
attest to the arrival date fell to the settler, as did the costs for the survey and filing fees. In most
counties, the Board of Land Commissioners went to work without delay because of the extreme
importance of land to the citizens. The later land laws established under the State of Texas were
set up in much the same way, but with land also being granted preemptively, through âsquattersâ
rights.â Land also was distributed in differing amounts for military service. âThus it, was
virtually impossible, theoretically, for a Texas family to be landlessâ (Fehrenbach 1968:283).
With the question of annexation to the United States unanswered, Mexico again laid claim to
Texas as part of its territories in 1837. During this period, San Antonio and Bexar County once
more became the setting for numerous hostilities between Mexican and Texan forces. Finally,
after truce had been declared in 1843, the question of annexing Texas was once again raised in
the U.S. Congress. By this time, sentiment had shifted in the United States, and on December 29,
1845, Texas was annexed officially.
American Statehood
The annexation of Texas by the United States brought about many changes in the region.
Commerce, which had faltered in the Texas Republic period during hostilities with Mexico,
improved. San Antonio became a center for stagecoach travel into the region (McGraw and
Hindes 1987:95). Immigration from the rest of the United States increased rapidly, as did the
arrival of refugees from abroad. The population became much more diversified with the
organized immigration of Alsatian, French, and German colonists. These colonists clustered in
Castroville and New Braunfels. From there the German colonists spread into the Balcones
Escarpment regions west and north of San Antonio including communities like Helotes and Leon
Springs (McNatt et al. 2000:29). One interesting fact relating to San Antonio is that âby 1850,
and for many years afterward, European, mostly German, immigrants in San Antonio
outnumbered both Mexicans and Anglosâ (Fehrenbach 1968:285).
23

During the early years of statehood, the San Antonio region continued to be âAnglicized.â This
was true in all areas and was demonstrated by a growing use of more âAngloâ types of
architecture and building materials. In San Antonio itself, small businesses thrived and fledgling
industries developed.
Military exploration of the lands west of San Antonio was necessary to open the west to trade and
settlement. The military exploration and presence also served to defend the frontier and enable
military personnel and civilians to identify and claim tracts of land to the west. The military was
charged in 1849 with finding a suitable road for commerce between San Antonio and El Paso.
The route identified followed the well-established Pinta Trail that connected San Antonio to
Fredericksburg, Presidio San Saba, and eventually El Paso. This was known as the upper route
and present-day IH 10 West now follows this historic road (Freeman 1994). The lower route
followed a more southerly route and passed over the Devils, Nueces, Frio, and Seco rivers before
arriving in San Antonio from El Paso.
In Texas, the political situation, like that throughout the United States, was uneasy during the
1850s. When the rest of the South seceded from the Union in 1860â1861, the state of Texas
voted overwhelmingly to follow. In general, the region around San Antonio fared better that
most during the Civil War. When San Antonio was named the headquarters for the Cavalry of
the West in 1864, some of the smaller communities actually benefited from this posting because
of the increased travel through the region (McGraw and Hindes 1987:99).
The initial years after the Civil War, however, brought several setbacks in the region. Much of
the area had suffered from a severe drought in 1863. In some areas where slaves once had
worked large plantations, tenant farming became the norm. In the latter years of the century, land
speculation seemed to be very common.

METHODS

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS WITHIN THE STUDY AREA
Prior to conducting fieldwork, a literature search of the site files at CAR at the University of
Texas at San Antonio and at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) at the
University of Texas at Austin was conducted. This review examined the records of known sites
within 1.6 km (1 mi) of the project corridor. The review indicated that 39 archeological sites are
located within the search radius, although none occurs within the project area (Table 3). Two of
the archeological sites include Missions San JosÃ© and ConcepciÃ³n, 41BX3 and 41BX12 Record
searches at TARL and CAR revealed many sites associated with the nearby Mission Parkway are
located within the search radius. It is important to note that not all of the sites listed possess state
trinomial site numbers. The sites noted in Table 3 with âMPâ (Mission Parkway) numbers only
consist largely of old houses, some of which are still occupied, or are the locations provided by
local informants to Scurlock and colleagues (1976).
In An Archeological and Historical Survey of the Proposed Mission Parkway, Scurlock et al.
(1976) provide the most comprehensive assessment of archeological resources in the mission
area. Conducted by the THC, the project investigated the current parkway area for the city of San
Antonio. The survey recorded more than 80 archeological sites, the large majority of which are
historic. Much of the surveyed area was declared a National Historic District, now known as the
San Antonio Missions National Historic Park.
Other archeological projects have also been conducted in the vicinity of the project area. The
University of Texas at San Antonio, CAR, and the Texas Historical Commission (THC)
performed most of these investigations, the majority of which consisted of small-scale projects
related to changing management needs at the historic missions and the bank of the San Antonio
River (see Dowling 2008; Escobedo 1984; Figueroa and Tomka 2009; Fox 1988; Ivey and Fox
1999; Killen and Scurlock 1977; Meissner et al. 2007; Meskill 1992; Trailor et al. 1982; Ulrich
2007). Numerous projects have been conducted by GMI in association with similar pipeline
replacement projects immediately south of the current project location (Largent and Duke 2003;
Peukert and Wurtz 2003; TinÃ© and Largent 2005). Testing excavations were also performed by
GMI at numerous sites within the nearby Mission Reach Project Area (Osburn et al. 2007; Peter
et al. 2006). The survey by TinÃ© and Largent (2005) was located immediately south of the

current project area on a portion of the Stinson Municipal Airport grounds. This work was
guided by an earlier probability study performed for the city of San Antonio Aviation Department
that identified archeologically sensitive areas where burials were likely to be encountered (Cave
et al. 2003). Concerning the portion of the surveys that partially overlap with the current survey
east of Roosevelt Street, both Cave et al. (2003) and TinÃ© and Largent (2005) found that a high
degree of disturbance is expected in association with the existing sewer pipelines in the area and
no in situ cultural materials were identified.
The two sites closest to the project area are MP-43 and 41BX267. Site MP-43 was identified by
Scurlock et al. (1976) as a portion of Stinson Field west of Roosevelt Avenue that was
temporarily acquired by the United States Air Force during World War II. Between 1942 and
1946, numerous military maintenance and storage buildings were constructed on the property.
These were then used by the National Guard for two to three years before being torn down and
abandoned. In a 1955 aerial photograph, the Army barracks west of Roosevelt can still be seen
adjacent to the project area (Historic Aerials 2010a). Scurlock et al. (1976) note that during the
27

first months of their field investigation in 1974 substantial foundations and rubble were still
visible in the area. However, the construction of the football fields during the same year removed
evidence of the army foundations. The extensive landscaping of the area of the football fields is
visible in a succession of historic aerial photographs between 1973 and 1986 (Historic Aerials
2010b, 2010c).
Site 41BX267 (MP-67) is the San JosÃ© Acequia, a long linear site located east of Roosevelt
Avenue for much of the length of the project area. The acequia was built around 1730 at the time
when the mission was moved to the west bank of the San Jose River, and it continued to function
until the 1950s (Scurlock et al. 1976). Portions of the acequia have been identified in recent
projects and assigned new site numbers (e.g., 41BX1802) when associated historic debris has
been located. The acequia is not known to have intersected the project area in any location.
The most recent investigations near the project area were conducted in 2009 by SWCA (Culotta
et al. 2010). Numerous historic artifact scatters were recorded (e.g., 41BX1803, 41BX1805,
41BX1806) near the San JosÃ© Acequia as part of the Riverside Golf Course Cultural Resources
Investigations. The sites recorded were primarily related to the early 1900s and most were
recorded in disturbed contexts as part of the project. Although the presence of cultural materials
in highly disturbed settings offers little to our understanding of the past, these locations do
demonstrate the density of cultural materials in the vicinity of the current project area.

PEDESTRIAN SURVEY
The entire project corridor was traversed during the pedestrian survey portion of the present
investigations. For the majority of the project length, slip-lining the existing pipe will be
performed, though some open-cut work will be performed south of March Street to the 97th Street
tie-in near Stinson Municipal Airport. Due to the extensive disturbance from roads, underground
utilities, and land leveling, the project area north of March Street was not shovel-tested, although
shovel testing was performed in undeveloped areas thought to be undisturbed. A review of
geological maps indicated that the undeveloped portions of the project corridor were not likely to
contain deeply buried (i.e., greater than 80 cm below surface) archeological materials due to the
age and stability of the geological deposits (Largent and Duke 2003). Consequently, shovel tests
were spaced at 100-m (330-ft) intervals. Shovel tests were typically 30 cm (11.8 in) in diameter
and excavated to the B-horizon. All soil was screened through .25-in (6.35-mm) mesh hardware
cloth.
A site is defined on the basis of content and extent. When a shovel test yields cultural material,
additional shovel tests are excavated in the cardinal directions in a cruciform pattern at 5-m (16.5ft) intervals around the initial test until two sterile shovel tests are encountered. A site is then
defined within the extent of positive shovel tests. For surficial materials, a site is defined as five
or more cultural items of at least two different artifact materials or classes (e.g., prehistoric stone
tool manufacturing debris exhibiting different raw materials, or manufacturing debris in
combination with stone tools; or historic-era ceramics [or glass] of several different types, or
ceramics in addition to glass) within a 20-m (65.6-ft) square. Cultural remains meeting these
criteria are designated as a site, recorded on a Texas Archeological Site Data Form, and submitted
to TARL in Austin for a permanent trinomial. Conversely, the discovery of one or two cultural
items (either surface or subsurface) not meeting these criteria is considered an isolated occurrence
of human activity and is simply documented by location and content; likewise, historic-era
28

material representing an obvious single-event trash dump is not considered a site, with only
location and content documented.
Although no artifacts were collected and thus none require curation, all notes, forms, and
photographs obtained during this project will be curated at CAR at the University of Texas at San
Antonio.

CHAPTER 5
RESULTS

The pedestrian survey found that large portions of the project area were disturbed by prior cutand-fill operations and by recent construction and demolition. A total of 12 shovel tests was
excavated during the pedestrian survey (Figure 3; Table 4). The results of the pedestrian and
reconnaissance surveys are presented below.
The southern end of the project area begins near the intersection of 97th Street and Apollo Street,
immediately east of Roosevelt Avenue near Stinson Municipal Airport. The eastern pipe is
visible on the surface from the beginning of the project area, but the western pipe begins
immediately after the project area crosses Apollo Street (Figure 4). Extending beyond the project
easement from each pipe is a gradual slope of disturbed fill that continues for the majority of the
project area. Two shovel tests were excavated east of Roosevelt Avenue on the edge of the
project easement. Numerous small asphalt and asbestos fragments were the only cultural
materials recovered in the shovel tests, and the soil profile encountered suggested that the entire
area has been highly disturbed.
The project area then crosses Roosevelt Avenue at an oblique angle and continues through a
portion of the Pop Warner football field parking lot before entering a wooded portion of Stinson
Park (Figure 5). As discussed previously, this property is the location of a World War II Air
Force complex before being converted into athletic fields in 1974. Scurlock et al. (1976) mention
that the construction of the football fields removed all evidence of foundations on the property.
Although this project intersects only a small portion of this property, it is evident that this area
has been extensively landscaped. One shovel test was excavated within the parking area and the
soil profile consisted entirely of disturbed fill. No foundations or other historic materials were
identified.
As the route passes through the wooded area at the south end of Stinson Park, dense understory
vegetation limited ground surface visibility. The western pipeline was not visible for much of
this area until the project area crosses a small intermittent stream at the north end of the wooded
area. In one location, a circular pile of coarse concrete was found in the approximate location of
the western pipe (Figure 6). Three meters north of the concrete pile, brick fragments were
identified on the surface (Figure 7). The brick fragments are mortared in a wide circular pattern
and are only located on the western portion of the project area. In the immediate area, the eastern

Notice the curvature in the fragments. These are interpreted as the remains of the original 42-inch sewer
pipeline that is still extant in some areas.

sewer pipe is exposed above the ground surface. The eastern line was installed in 1950 and it
replaced an earlier 42-inch brick pipeline built in ca. 1890, and the western line was installed in
1918. One shovel test was excavated immediately adjacent to the brick pile to search for
additional cultural materials. The shovel test revealed only a highly disturbed soil profile and no
additional cultural materials were identified. The brick fragments and concrete pile seem to be
related to the construction and maintenance of the sewer pipelines and do not represent historic
habitation features.
The project area crosses a small, unnamed intermittent stream approximately 60 m north of the
concrete pile and brick rubble. A small culvert has been constructed to allow the pipelines to pass
over the stream and the project easement is elevated above the natural ground surface by
approximately 2 m (Figure 8). This entire area was found to be disturbed within the project
easement and thus no shovel tests were excavated in the area.
Approximately 40 m north of the small stream is the cleared field of Stinson Park. Similar to the
beginning of the project area, the sewer pipes can be easily seen running in a northwesterly
direction through the park toward March Avenue (Figure 9). Within the project easement, the
ground surface is slightly elevated above the surface of the surrounding field. The tapered crown
within the project corridor is slightly irregular and extends for 10 m west of the pipeline and 5 m
to the east. A diffuse scatter of numerous brick fragments was visible on the surface within the
project area but absent throughout the rest of the park. Six shovel tests were excavated within the
120-m open field (see Table 4). Historic cultural materials were identified in Shovel Tests 5, 7, 8,

and 9 in disturbed contexts. The majority of materials identified were undecorated and unglazed
ceramic sherds, wire nails, colored bottle glass, and unidentifiable ferrous metal (Figures 10 and
11). Two temporally diagnostic artifacts were recovered from within the upper disturbed portion
of Shovel Test 8. These were a decorated glass fragment and a whiteware rim sherd. The glass
artifact was a clear pressed cut lid fragment that included the handle and a small portion of the lid
body (Figure 12). The lid fragment is possibly part of a covered candy bowl. Small diamond
point cuts decorated the interior portion of the body, and large star/diamond point decorations
were found on the outside of the handle. Similar decorated vessels have yielded a date of circa
1890 to 1930.

The ceramic artifacts identified in Shovel Test 8 included one very light blue tinted white ware
rim sherd, a very light blue tinted whiteware base of a small plate, and two fragments of an
unfinished type of stoneware. The decorations of the rim sherd consist of small raised dots and
arcs along the top portion of the rim (Figure 13). The base fragment of the plate did not lend any
information concerning origin by way of makerâs mark (Figure 14). The decoration on the rim
sherd and slight color tint indicate that the two ceramic sherds are of the 1880 to 1930 timeframe.
The two unfinished ceramics did not provide any information concerning timeframe or origin.
The glass and ceramic plate sherds are consistent with a turn-of-the-century timeframe, from
approximately 1880 to 1930. This time period is consistent with the time period in which the
sewer lines were initially installed.

The results of the shovel testing within Stinson Park indicated that historic artifacts are confined
to the disturbed portions of the pipeline easement (Figure 15). Below the disturbed fill
surrounding the sewer pipes is an undisturbed, dark, organic-rich topsoil consistent with the soils
described by the NRCS in the area. No cultural materials were identified in the undisturbed
portions of the shovel tests excavated within the park. Thus, the presence of the historic materials
within the pipeline fill was documented as an isolated dumping event associated with the
construction of the pipeline. These materials do not meet the criteria for an archeological site as
previously outlined.
After crossing March Avenue, the right-of-way sewer lines pass through the Kelly Ann apartment
complex parking lot. For the extent of the project area from this point northward, the replacement
project will involve slip-lining the existing sewer lines. A reconnaissance survey was performed
for the length of this portion of the project that involved shovel testing only in open areas.
Immediately north of the Kelly Ann apartment complex is an open field adjacent to the Omega
Church (Figure 16). Two shovel tests were excavated at the edge of the project easement on this
property. More disturbed fill deposits were encountered in these shovel tests and a scatter of
brick was seen across the field (Figure 17). No cultural materials were identified in undisturbed
contexts within this property.
North of the Omega Church property, the project area passes through several parking lots and
residential properties before joining Quintard Street at the intersection of Military Drive.
Specifically, the pipes pass adjacent to the parking lot of the Kingâs Kids youth ministry,
northwest of the Omega Church. On East Harding Boulevard, the pipes pass under the Ravenhill
Baptist Church Parking lot before passing between two residential properties (234 and 241 Lorita
Drive). North of Lorita Drive, the pipes pass through the parking lot of the Tianguis Mall (Figure
18). An examination of aerial photographs revealed that this property was the former location of
a drive-in movie theater. Photographs dating to 1955 and 1973 show a theater with standing
buildings (Historic Aerials 2010a, 2010b). In the 1986 photograph, an empty lot was visible on
the property (Historic Aerials 2010c). The Bexar County appraisal web page states that the
Tianguis Mall building and parking lot were constructed in 1986. Immediately north of this
property, the sewer lines continue under the parking lot and pass between a bank and auto parts
store properties before meeting Quintard Street.
North of Military Drive, the project area follows the centerline of Quintard Street for 2 km
(1.24 mi). This neighborhood largely consists of single-story, ranch-style dwellings with either
aluminum siding or brick veneer exteriors. A review of the Bexar County appraisal records
indicated that this neighborhood was largely constructed between the 1930s and 1950s. All of the
dwellings are located sufficiently away from Quintard Street that they will not be affected by the
current project. There are numerous disturbances within the project easement (i.e., driveways,
fences, buried utilities, sidewalks) that affect the archeological integrity within this area. Beyond
the roadway itself, an overhead power line follows the western side of the road (Figure 19).
Sidewalks occasionally parallel the road through much of the neighborhood. However, graveled
shoulders and other landscaping are present on blocks where the sidewalk is absent (Figure 20).
The current project will not affect any historic properties within this neighborhood.

Quintart Street terminates at the intersection of East Sayers Avenue. The project area continues
in a northerly direction for four blocks to the end at Hart Avenue. For the remainder of the
project, the pipelines pass through the properties of numerous residential dwellings. Similar to
the remainder of the project, these dwellings consist largely of single-story, aluminum siding
residences constructed between 1930 and 1955 (Figure 21). Since none of the buildings
possesses architectural qualities that cannot be found throughout the entire neighborhood, none is
eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. Thus, the current project will not
affect any historic properties within the neighborhood.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The reconnaissance and pedestrian surveys showed that much of the project area has been
disturbed by previous cut-and-fill episodes related to the initial installation of the twin sewer
pipelines as well as by residential landscaping and maintenance. Twelve shovel tests were
judgmentally placed in areas where the proposed project will involve open cutting. These areas
are primarily south of March Street in city park land and were thought to retain good contextual
integrity. The shovel test results demonstrated that the pipeline corridor within the project area
contained at least 50 cm of disturbed fill. Within this disturbed fill, cultural materials were
identified that likely reflect variable densities of imported brick, ferrous metals, and other
imported cultural debris. Historic aerial photographs indicated that the land use within this area
has not changed within the park land since 1955 and no structures could be identified in the area
relating to these materials. No cultural materials were identified in undisturbed contexts beneath
the disturbed fill during the survey. Thus, it was interpreted that the historic cultural materials
were brought in with the fill that was used when the pipelines were initially installed. The
presence of these historic cultural materials found within highly disturbed contexts does not
warrant the designation of an archeological site.
As a result of the present survey, it is recommended that the proposed construction will not have
an effect on significant cultural deposits in the project right-of-way. However, should in situ
cultural deposits be encountered during the construction, construction should cease and the Texas
Historical Commission notified.
