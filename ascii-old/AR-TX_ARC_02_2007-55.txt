ABSTRACT
The ATV area at Buffalo Springs Lake is part of the property owned and managed by the
Lubbock County WCID No. 1. In order to upgrade the use of the ATV area, the District
applied for and was awarded a grant to install improved signage in the ATV area. Due to
the known archaeological potential of the surrounding area, an archaeological survey of
the ATV area was requested by Texas Parks and Wildlife and the Texas Historical
Commission. A comprehensive pedestrian archaeological survey of the 93.7 acre ATV
area was conducted by AR Consultants, Inc. A total of 49 shovel tests were excavated in
the undisturbed areas and three backhoe trenches were excavated in a previously
unmapped playa. No evidence of prehistoric occupation was found on the eroded,
formerly farmed, and otherwise disturbed present ground surface nor in the shovel tests
or in the backhoe trenches. Charcoal from the playa floor was dated 12,020±BP (Beta
235632) provided a post-creation date for the playa. Unfortunately no cultural materials
were associated with the small amount of charcoal. The absence of prehistoric occupation
on this small part of the Llano Estacado is attributed to the difficult access to a permanent
water source and to the level terrain which contrasts with the rolling terrain just to the
west where numerous sites have been recorded. Based on the findings of this survey, AR
Consultants recommends that the District be allowed to proceed with the installation of
signage in the ATV area.

INTRODUCTION
Buffalo Springs Lake was created on the North Fork of the Double Mountain Fork of the
Brazos River in 1920 and has been enlarged and the elevation raised since that time. It
was purchased by the Lubbock County Water Control and Improvement District No. 1
(hereafter LCWCID No. 1) in 1957 and it is the location of a village also known as
Buffalo Springs Lake (Figure 1). The lake is the site of numerous local activities
including boat races, waterskiing shows, bicycle races, sailboat regattas, marathons, and
country music programs. On an annual basis the lake is visited by one million people.
Besides providing camping and picnicking facilities, an ATV area has been developed on
the bluff top south of the lake. The city was awarded a grant from the Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department to improve the ATV area by installing permanent signage. After
receiving the grant, the city was advised that an archaeological survey of the ATV area
was needed before they proceeded with development. LCWCID No. 1 contracted with
AR Consultants, Inc. to carry out the needed pedestrian archaeological survey.

The purpose of the survey was to determine if any cultural resources were present within
the ATV area and if so how they might be impacted by the planned improvements. The
survey was done under the authority of the Antiquities Code of Texas as administered by
the Texas Historical Commission. This report was written in accordance with the survey
guidelines adopted by the Texas Historical commission, as well as the Council of Texas
Archeologists (2002:8-9). The following report presents first a brief description of the
natural setting of the project area. This is followed with a short section on the regional
cultural history, the research design, and methodology used. The results are next
discussed with the concluding recommendations. The references cited finalize the report.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The ATV area is situated in the upland south of Buffalo Springs Lake. The lake dams the
upper end of the North Fork of the Double Mountain Fork of the Brazos River just
downstream from where Yellowhouse Draw joins with Blackwater Draw. Both draws
cross the Llano Estacado from the west and are known primarily for archaeological sites,
the Blackwater Draw site in New Mexico and the Lubbock Lake site, that are situated in
the valley flood sediments. The Llano Estacado is a generally level upland that is covered
by a thin mantle of sand, quartz, silt, and massive caliche nodules known as the
Blackwater Draw Formation (Bureau of Economic Geology 1967). Numerous playa
depressions are scattered across the surface of the Llano Estacado. The Blanco Formation
is a thin layer of primarily white limestone that underlies the Blackwater Draw
Formation. The Ogallala Formation underlies the Blanco Formation and extends from the
contact to a thickness of 250 feet which is well below the Yellowhouse Canyon
floodplain at Buffalo Springs Lake. The Blanco Formation is exposed on the present
ground surface west of FM835 where it forms the resistant sloping upland south of the
canyon. Both the Ogallala and Blanco Formations contain gravels but no good gravel
exposures were noted in the ATV area. The Blanco Formation overlying the Ogallala
Formation is shown as Figure 2 below.

Despite the general soil descriptions provided by the Soil Conservation Service
(Blackstock 1979), the Acuff loam that covers almost all of the ATV area is relatively
shallow and alkaline is abundant within 30 cm of the present ground surface. The only
other prominent soil in the area is the unmapped Randall clay that fills the playa that is in
the southeast corner of the survey area.
The average annual rainfall in Lubbock County is 18.3 inches (Blackstock 1979:1).
Water collects in the playa and otherwise runs off, evaporates, or seeps into the bedrock.
No seep springs were noted along the bluff edge at the time of the survey.
The climax vegetation on the Llano Estacado was dominated by prairie grasses but more
recently the prairie has been invaded by cacti, yuccas, shrubs, and trees. The
Yellowhouse Canyon floodplain supports a more forested vegetation and has done so for
centuries. Feeding on the plants and consuming the water are antelope, deer, and prairie
dogs along with a variety of birds, snakes, and other animals.

CULTURAL SETTING
The cultural resources of prehistoric Texas are diverse depending on where the study area
is located. The study area encompasses a section of the caprock bluffs of the Llano
Estacado at Buffalo Springs Lake located along Yellowhouse Canyon. This section
presents a brief explanation of the five major chronological periods; the Paleoindian,
Archaic, Ceramic, Protohistoric, and Historic which are taken from Johnson and Holliday
(1995:522-531).
The Paleoindian period (10,000-6500 BC) was a time of cooler temperatures in the
summer and warmer winters with greater humidity than today. Streams and rivers were
more perennial depositing sediment into draws where vegetation was plentiful.
Occupation at Lubbock Lake has yielded many species of megafauna showing evidence
of butchering and one resharpened Clovis point. Other chipped stone tools have not yet
been found.
The Archaic period (6500 BC-AD 1) showed a climate change that had begun late in the
Paleoindian period. Hard water marshes were replacing the perennial streams due to
decreased humidity and overall drying trend. Sand dunes started to form in playas, and
lunettes because of the lack of vegetation. During the Middle Archaic at Lubbock Lake,
28 activity areas have been located where evidence of camping, bison kill/butchering, and
plant processing occurred. Occupation continued through the Late Archaic at Lubbock
Lake.
The Ceramic period (AD 1-1500) began when a drought condition replaced the semihumid climate of the Archaic period. Johnson and Holliday state that though not perfectly
clear, the drought was severe enough to modify the vegetation in the area. Puebloan trade
pottery and plains lithics have been recovered at the Floydada Country Club site and
Gresham Lake site. At Lubbock Lake, processing stations were found where bison,
antelope, coyote, and wolf, and antelope were butchered.
The Protohistoric period (AD 1500-1700) at Lubbock Lake had occupations where large
game was processed through the time period. Garza arrow points are common during this
period.
The Historic period (AD 1650-1960) is marked by European material recovered in the
archaeological record. At Lubbock Lake, Washita points characterize the historic period
at animal butchering sites where horses were game animals. These sites are scattered
across the Llano Estacado. Historic Anglo sites ranging from sheepherder’s camps,
homesteads, and town buildings were reported from Justiceburg Reservoir.
Previous Investigations
A search for historic and prehistoric archaeological sites within the study area was
conducted on the Texas Archeological Site Atlas (TASA 2007). Many sites have been
recorded in Lubbock County and surveys have been done just to the west and east of the

ATV area. The sites just to the west are situated on Blanco Formation previously
mentioned. Soils are deeper than in the ATV area and the terrain has a more prominent
topographic relief. The distance to Yellowhouse Canyon is similar but numerous
campsites/lithic scatter sites are present in this immediate area.
Most of the western sites were recorded by Charles Johnson in 1974. Sites 41LU15, and
16 contained worked stone, flakes, a broken knife, and bone that was burned and
unburned. Sites close to or on the bluff edge included 41LU17, 18, 19, and 129 had
flakes, broken ground stone, and a worked core. There are numerous other sites
analogous to this setting further north along the caprock edge. Site 41LU129 was tested
and a buried prehistoric deposit was uncovered but has not been dated.
The area east of the ATV area also has a slightly deep soil that the ATV area. Site
41LU88 was recorded by Eric Schroeder in 1993. The survey was done in order to
determine the archeological potential for the location of a wastewater disposal pipeline.
Site 41LU88 consisted of a scatter of hearthstones and lithic debris that was disturbed and
demonstrated no depth. Isolated finds consisted of hearthstones, five lithic tools, and five
lithic flakes that were located along the access roads and proposed plant site. A total of
58 artifacts were located; only one was found below the surface (Johnson, Hicks, and
Schroeder 1993).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
Research in the Buffalo Springs Lake ATV area was guided by the results of surveys
conducted in the immediately adjacent parts of the upland along the south side of
Yellowhouse Canyon. Prehistoric sites had been recorded just to the west of Highway
FM835 in the canyon bottom and slopes but more importantly in the upland on
peninsulas that overlook the canyon bottom as well as at settings on the adjacent upland
that rise to the south. In contrast, the study area is generally level with little variation in
elevation except for a single north-south oriented ridge that is in the northeast part of the
area. However, as indicated above at least one recorded prehistoric site that is in a setting
similar to the study area. No evidence of historic occupation in these upland areas has
been reported. Consequently, it was the hypothesis of this investigation that:
Prehistoric occupation was likely to be discovered within the study area in
settings where finger ridges overlooked the Yellowhouse valley edge as
well as level settings located back from the valley edge. Furthermore, it
was expected that occupation might also be associated with the playa and
associated dunes if present. Historic occupation was not expected to be
found unless trash had been discarded in gullies or over the bluffs along
the valley margin.

A pedestrian survey of the entire tract was carried out to determine if cultural materials
were present on the ground surface. The tract covers an area of 93.7 acres, of which 11
had been mined for caliche and rock and where the original ground surface is no longer
present. Thus the APE for this investigation included 82.7 acres of relatively level
upland. Due to the dense vegetative growth that is the result of a very wet year, we not
only systematically inspected the ATV area but we searched out eroded areas including
roads and trails, cleared areas, a gopher colony, and the bluff edge where the bedrock and
thin soils provided good exposures. Shovel testing was carried out during the pedestrian
survey but was ultimately focused upon the northeast ridge where it was expected deeper
soils might be found and occupation might have been focused. Ultimately, backhoe
trenching was done in the playa.

RESULTS

Survey began in the western mined area where the topsoil and the limestone bedrock had
both been removed. This is shown as a quarry on the Buffalo Springs Lake, TX 7.5’
USGS map and the uneven mining of the rock has created an area which has attracted the
attention of ATV riders (Figure 3). The erosion caused by mining (Figures 4 and 5) and
vehicular traffic has not exposed any buried features or cultural materials around the
edges of the mined area and we have concluded that this part of the ATV area has no
archaeological potential.

The pedestrian survey began in the southwestern corner of the un-mined ATV area which
is adjacent to the plowed field shown on Figure 3. The survey team proceeded to the
north and east surveying the surface and adjacent trails/roads that are shown on the map.
Particular attention was given to inspecting the bluff edge which presented an eroded area
that averaged more than ten meters in width extending back from the bluff edge. Many
other eroded areas were also inspected and the slope below the bluff edge was also
inspected due to the likelihood that the bluff has eroded back over the past thousands of
years and may have deflated surface or buried sites onto the eroding bedrock. It is
unlikely that the bedrock that forms the upland edge has been eroding at the rate that
Bousman (Boyd, Bousman, and Freeman 1991:47) has described for the Lake Allen
Henry area since the Lubbock Lake site is in the present valley floodplain.
Survey along the bluff edge and in the adjacent uplands began to reveal that the bedrock
or top of the caliche/bedrock was only a short distance below the ground surface (Figures
6 and 7) and that the likelihood of finding buried cultural deposits was low particularly
since soils as deep as reported for sites 41LU129 and 41LU88 were not present. In all, an
estimated 10 acres of eroded area that included the bluff edge and roads/trails were
inspected but no cultural materials were found.
The individual shovel tests are described in Table 1 which is at the end of this chapter.
Many of the shovel tests revealed a shallow bedrock upper surface just below the ground
surface (Figure 8). After the finger ridges and bluff edges had been thoroughly inspected
and it had been determined that the topsoil was shallower than described by the Soil
Conservation Service (Blackstock 1979:Sheet 44), it seemed most likely that occupation
might be found in what appeared to be deeper sediments located on the north-south ridge
in the northeastern part of the ATV area. Consequently, two parallel rows of shovel tests
were excavated down the ridge and they continued south to the playa depression.
Ultimately it became apparent that the topsoil was as thin in this area as it is elsewhere
and that the bedrock was only a short depth below the surface. No cultural materials were
found in these shovel tests or in the shovel tests excavated in the formerly farmed area
west of the ridge. The soil was not significantly deeper in this previously farmed area
where STs40 and 49 were placed but it was sandier and was the home to an active colony
of gophers. Inspection of their backdirt piles failed to find any artifacts or other evidence
of prehistoric occupation that they had brought to the surface.
Shovel testing and augering demonstrated that the playa south of the ridge extended
outward from the muddy depression in the center a distance of approximately 50 m as
shown in STs 36 and 37. Shovel testing demonstrated that the underlying bedrock
gradually got deeper as distance from the outer edge toward the center increased.
Furthermore, a shovel test (ST38) and auger hole determined that the sediment in the fill
of the playa was at least 1.67 m deep and that the underlying bedrock had not been
reached at that point. Slight color changes were noted in the shovel test/auger hole matrix
but no cultural materials or evidence of developed soils were found.

Three five meter long backhoe trenches were excavated on the eastern side of the playa in
a setting where it was expected that prehistoric occupation was likely to have occurred.
All three trenches are oriented roughly east-west and allowed us to generate a profile
from the floor of the playa to the outer edge (Figure 10). Survey outside of the eastern
edge of the playa failed to find any evidence of occupation or of developed sand dunes in
the lea of the playa. Thus it seemed unlikely that evidence of occupation would be found
in the playa itself.

Figure 10.

Looking north across the primary playa depression.

Backhoe trench 1 was placed completely in the bottom of the playa and west of a hand
dug profile recorded during the survey (Figure 11). All three trenches were
approximately five meters long and Trench 1 reached level limestone bedrock at a depth
of 2.75 m. The upper 20 cm was a very dark gray (10YR3/1) clay that had almost no sand
in it. This layer had been recently deposited and eroded out of the adjacent field. The clay
was moist due to recent rains. This upper deposit represented clay that had washed into
the playa depression and had apparently been repeatedly churned by ATV vehicles
playing in the mud. Below this between 20 cm and 250 cm, the matrix was a very dark
grayish brown (10YR3/2) sandy clay that was compact but not noticeably blocky. It had a
higher clay content between 107 and 250 cm. From 250-268 cm, the sandy clay was dark
grayish brown (10YR4/2). The bottom seven cm was a strong brown (7.5YR5/6) sandy

clay that contained small pieces of charcoal and a sample of the matrix was radiocarbon
dated 12,020±90 (Beta-235632). This was resting on top of limestone bedrock below 275
cm. No cultural material was found in this lower clay but dating it should provide
information about the time when the first deposition in the playa occurred (Johnson
2007).
Trench 2 was excavated in the edge of the pronounced depression with the expectation
that this might represent a step-up in the playa floor (Figure 12). The upper 97 cm was a
very dark gray (10YR3/1) slightly sandy clay that was slightly blocky but contained no
caliche. Caliche was scattered in the next three cm but the matrix did not change. From
100 to 348 cm the matrix was a sandy clay that was dark gray (10YR4/1). Bedrock was
reached at 348 cm below the present ground surface. As in Trench 1 no soil horizons,
occupation surfaces, or artifacts were encountered. The bedrock is at about the same
elevation as in Trench 1.
Trench 3 was started 22.5 m east of Trench 2 and it revealed that the bedrock was barely
1.24 m below the ground surface and was rising to the east (Figure 13). The matrix
throughout was very dark gray (10YR3/1) sandy clay throughout and was blocky to 70
cm below the surface and from there to 124 cm the matrix was compact but slightly
moist.

Conclusions
A pedestrian survey of the Buffalo Springs Lake was conducted to determine if the ATV
area had been occupied prehistorically. Despite extensive erosion, shallow soils, the
excavation of shovel tests and backhoe trenches, the survey found no evidence of
prehistoric or historic cultural resources on or under the surface. This finding is in direct
contrast with the previous recording of site 41LU88 to the east where a surface lithic
scatter was found and only a single artifact was recovered from a shovel test. It is also in
sharp contrast with the recording and testing of upland sites just west of FR835. Each of

these previously recorded campsites appears to have been briefly occupied and probably
utilized by small family or task groups.
The setting is similar to Blanco Canyon in Floydada where the Floydada County Club
site (Word 1968, 1991) and a multiple tipi ring site have been recorded. The setting is
also similar to the Western Turbine Arrays area in the Bull Creek Wind Farm (Lang and
Skinner 2007) where no evidence of occupation was encountered. It is also near Post
where the 1993 TAS Field School in Archeology found numerous sites on the caprock
edge and on the adjacent slopes (Litwinionek, Johnson, and Davis 1997). It cannot be
attributed to a lack of quarryable lithic gravels or to a setting that is definitely different
from site 41LU88 which is on the same bluff. Based on the negative results of the survey,
the absence of sites in the ATV area is attributed to a lack of easy access to water in
Yellowhouse Canyon.

RECOMMENDATIONS
ARC recommends that construction and sign installation proceed as planned since no
significant cultural resources were discovered during the pedestrian survey or testing. It is
our impression that this immediate area was not occupied prehistorically since easy
access to potable water was not possible. If sites are encountered during construction,
work should cease immediately in that area and the Archeology Division of the Texas
Historical Commission should be contacted.
