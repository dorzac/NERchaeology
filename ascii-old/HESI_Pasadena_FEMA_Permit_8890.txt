MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) was selected by Berg-Oliver Associates,
Inc. (BOA), on behalf of the City of Pasadena, to conduct an archeological inventory survey and
assessment for the proposed City of Pasadena Drainage Improvements Project in Pasadena,
Harris County, Texas. The City of Pasadena has received a grant from the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) to undertake a unique, city-wide drainage improvements project.
The City is proposing to lower the elevation of numerous city streets by one to two feet with the
goal of enhancing the drainage properties of the streets, effectively transforming the streets
themselves into drainage channels during significant rain and/or flood events. Approximately
100 city streets, or segments thereof, scattered throughout the city limits have been selected for
this pilot program, and other streets may be modified in a similar fashion in the future if the
program proves to be successful. Eleven new storm water detention ponds and a new pump
station would also be constructed around the city as part of the project.
The proposed undertaking is being sponsored by the City of Pasadena, a political
subdivision of the state of Texas; as such, the project falls under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities
Code of Texas (ACT). In addition, the project would utilize a grant provided by FEMA, a federal
agency; as such, the project also falls under the jurisdiction of Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. As the proposed project represents a publicly
sponsored undertaking, the project sponsor is required to provide the applicable federal agencies
and the Texas Historical Commission (THC), which serves as the State Historic Preservation
Office (SHPO) for the state of Texas, with an opportunity to review and comment on the project’s
potential to adversely affect historic properties listed on or considered eligible for listing on the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and/or for designation as State Antiquities
Landmarks (SAL).
On 24 April 2019, Horizon’s Cultural Resources Director, Jesse Owens, and History
Program Manager, Eugene Foster, met with Bill Martin of the THC’s Archeology Division and
Kelly Little, FEMA’s historical resources liaison with the THC, to develop a scope of work that
would ensure the city’s compliance with the ACT and the NHPA. Historical architectural resources
will be evaluated as a separate component of the proposed undertaking. For archeological
resources, the THC’s archeological reviewer indicated that there should be little concern
regarding lowering the elevation of the streets of Pasadena by one to two feet below their current
grade. As such, for purposes of the archeological survey, Horizon concentrated archeological

survey activities on the 11 proposed detention pond footprints, the proposed pump station
location, and on four of the proposed street modification projects where they cross streams,
including two on Vince Bayou and two on Little Vince Bayou.
On 30 April and 1 May of 2019, Horizon project archeologist Charles Edward Bludau, Jr.
conducted an intensive archeological survey of the Project Area. Jeffrey D. Owens acted as
Principal Investigator, and the survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC)
Permit No. 8890.
The purpose of the survey was to locate any significant archeological
resources that potentially would be impacted by the proposed undertaking. Horizon’s archeologist
traversed the Project Area and thoroughly inspected the modern ground surface for aboriginal
and historic-age archeological resources. In addition to a pedestrian walkover, the Texas State
Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 3 shovel tests per
acre for project areas between 0.0 and 2.0 acres size. Additionally, for project areas between
3.0 and 10.0 acres in size, the TSMASS require 2 shovel tests per acre. As such, a minimum of
41 shovel tests were necessary within the Project Area. Horizon excavated a total of 59 shovel
tests, thereby exceeding the TSMASS for a Project Area of this size.
Shovel testing typically revealed moderately deep to deep deposits of sandy clay and clay
loams extending to depths of 60.0 centimeters (cm) (23.6 inches) or more below surface. Many
shovel tests contained calcium carbonate inclusions and dense clayey sediments at depths
ranging from 30.0 and 60.0 cm (11.8 and 23.6 inches). Many shovel tests exhibited signs of
disturbance in near-surface sediments in the form of heavily mottled clays and concrete pieces
and asphalt. It is Horizon’s opinion that sediments with the potential to contain subsurface
archeological deposits were fully penetrated and that the Project Area was adequately assessed
for archeological resources. No archeological sites, historic or prehistoric, were recorded within
the Project Area during the survey.
Based on the results of the survey-level investigations documented in this report, no
potentially significant archeological resources would be affected by the proposed undertaking. In
accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, Horizon has made a reasonable and good-faith effort to identify
historic properties within the Project Area. No archeological resources were identified within the
Project Area that meet the criteria for designation as SALs according to 13 TAC 26 or that qualify
for inclusion in the NRHP. Horizon recommends a finding of “no historic properties affected,” and
no further archeological work is recommended in connection with the proposed undertaking.
However, human burials, both prehistoric and historic, are protected under the Texas Health and
Safety Code. In the event that any human remains or burial objects are inadvertently discovered
at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance in the Project Area, even in
previously surveyed areas, all work should cease immediately in the vicinity of the inadvertent
discovery, and the THC should be notified immediately.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The Project Area is located in southeastern Harris County, Texas, within the City of
Pasadena, Texas. Harris County is situated on the Gulf Coastal Plain in southeastern Texas, and
the project site is located about 16.0 kilometers (km) (9.9 miles) west of Trinity Bay, an inlet of the
Gulf of Mexico formed by the confluence of Buffalo Bayou and the San Jacinto River between
Houston and Baytown, Texas. The Gulf of Mexico represents a structural basin formed by
lithosphere deformation. The Texas Coastal Plain, which extends as far north as the Ouachita
uplift in southern Oklahoma and westward to the Balcones Escarpment, consists of seawarddipping bodies of sedimentary rock, most of which are of terrigenous clastic origin, that reflect the
gradual infilling of the basin from its margins (Abbott 2001). Pasadena and the Houston area in
general are underlain by rocks and unconsolidated sediments that are quite young in a geological
sense, ranging from modern to Miocene in age. These consist predominantly of a series of
fluviodeltaic bodies arranged in an offlapped sequence, with interdigitated and capping eolian,
littoral, and estuarine facies making up a relatively minor component of the lithology. Major
bounding disconformities between these formations are usually interpreted to represent
depositional hiatuses that occurred during periods of sea level low stand. The oldest rocks in this
fill are of Late Cretaceous age. As a result of the geometry of basin filling, successively younger
rock units crop out in subparallel bands from the basin margin toward the modern coastline.
The Project Area is situated within the city limits of Pasadena, Texas. Vince Bayou and
Little Vince Bayou, both heavily channelized waterways, flow northward through the Project Area
toward the Houston Ship Channel. Elevations across the project site are relatively flat, averaging
approximately 9.1 meters (30.0 feet) above mean sea level (amsl). Photographs of the various
survey locations at the time of the cultural resources investigations are presented in Figures 2-1
through 2-16.

2.2

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

Geologically, the Project Area is underlain by the Beaumont Formation (Barnes 1982).
The Beaumont, or Prairie, terrace is the youngest continuous coastwise terrace fronting the
modern Gulf (Abbott 2001). The Beaumont Formation consists of clay, silt, and fine sand
arranged in spatial patterns that reflect the distribution of fluvial (e.g., channel, point bar, levee,

and backswamp) and mudflat/coastal marsh facies (Van Siclen 1985). Sandy deposits
associated with littoral facies are also frequently considered part of the Beaumont. Many
investigators (cf. DuBar et al. 1991; Fisk 1938, 1940) have correlated the Beaumont terrace with
the Sangamon Interglacial (ca. 130 to 75 thousand years ago [kya]), although age estimates
range from Middle Wisconsinan (Alford and Holmes 1985) to 100 to 600 kya (Blum and Price
1994). While debate about the temporal affiliations of and correlations among the deposits that
underlie the major coastline terraces remain active, they are of little direct geoarcheological
relevance because virtually all investigators agree that these deposits considerably predate the
earliest demonstrated dates of human occupation in North America.
The Project Area is underlain by Bernard-Urban land complex; Dylan clay, 3 to 5% slopes;
Lake Charles-Urban land complex; and Addicks-Urban land complex (Table 2-1; Figures 2-17
through 2-20) (NRCS 2019). These soils typically consist of Pleistocene age clayey and loamy
fluviomarine deposits.
In southeast Texas, aboriginal archeological sites are commonly encountered in upland
settings and adjacent to major streams and rivers, and historic-age sites may occur in virtually
any physiographic setting. Given the paved condition of the existing city streets throughout the
Project Area, Horizon utilized a limited archeological sampling strategy focused on areas of
archeological high probability and locations offering reasonably unobstructed access for shovel
testing.

CLIMATE

Evidence for climatic change from the Pleistocene to the present is most often obtained
through studies of pollen and faunal sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Collins 1995). While
the paleoclimatic history of the coastal region remains unclear, Bryant and Holloway (1985)
present a sequence of climatic change for nearby east-central Texas that includes three separate
climatic periods—the Wisconsin Full Glacial Period (22,500 to 14,000 B.P.), the Late Glacial
Period (14,000 to 10,000 B.P.), and the Post-Glacial Period (10,000 B.P. to present). Evidence
from the Wisconsin Full Glacial Period suggests that the climate in east-central Texas was
considerably cooler and more humid than at present. Pollen data indicate that the region was
more heavily forested in deciduous woodlands than during later periods (Bryant and Holloway
1985). The Late Glacial Period was characterized by slow climatic deterioration and a slow
warming and/or drying trend (Collins 1995). In east-central Texas, the deciduous woodlands were
gradually replaced by grasslands and post oak savannas (Bryant and Holloway 1985). During
the Post-Glacial Period, the east-central Texas environment appears to have been more stable.
The deciduous forests had long since been replaced by prairies and post oak savannas. The
drying and/or warming trend that began in the Late Glacial Period continued into the midHolocene, at which point there appears to have been a brief amelioration to more mesic conditions
lasting from roughly 6000 to 5000 B.P. Recent studies by Bryant and Holloway (1985) indicate
that modern environmental conditions in east-central Texas were probably achieved by 1,500
years ago.
The modern climate of the upper Texas coast, including the region surrounding Houston,
is classified as subtropical humid (Abbott 2001; Larkin and Bomar 1983), forming a transitional
zone between the humid southeastern US and the semiarid to arid west. The climate reflects the
influences of latitude, low elevation, and proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, which combine with the
urban heat island formed by the tremendous concentration of asphalt and concrete to give the
Houston area a notorious modern climate that is oppressively warm and moist throughout much
of the year. As a result of proximity to the Gulf and the abundance of surface water, humidity in
the early morning can approach 100% even on cloudless summer days, and it often exceeds 50%
even on the warmest afternoons. Largely as a consequence of the relatively high humidity
characteristic of the region, temperature patterns exhibit a moderate annual range and a modest
diurnal range that increases slightly with distance from the coast. Average monthly high
temperature ranges from a low of 17 to 19°Celcius (°C) (59 to 63°Fahrenheit [°F]) in January to a
high of 38 to 40°C (89 to 96°F) in August. Average monthly lows range from 4 to 9°C (38 to 47°F)
in January to 25 to 29°C (72 to 79°F) in July and August. Annually, average low temperatures
range from 15 to 21°C (56 to 65°F), and average high temperatures range from 27 to 29°C (75 to
79°F) (Abbott 2001; Larkin and Bomar 1983).
The Houston region experiences two precipitation peaks throughout the year (Abbott
2001). The first occurs in the late spring (i.e., May to June) due to the passage of infrequent cold
fronts that spawn chains of powerful frontal thunderstorms. The second occurs in the late summer
to early autumn (i.e., August to September) due to the incidence of tropical storms and hurricanes
from the Atlantic and, occasionally, Pacific oceans. In contrast, winter and early spring are

relatively dry, and high summer rainfall is dominated by convectional thunderstorms that are
relatively brief and localized, albeit frequently intense. Average annual precipitation varies from
a low of approximately 101.6 cm (40.0 inches) to a high of more than 132.1 cm (52.0 inches).
Average monthly precipitation varies from less than 5.1 to 7.0 cm (2.0 to 3.0 inches) in March to
more than 19.1 cm (7.5 inches) occurring locally on the coast during September. Almost all of
the measurable precipitation falls as rain—snowfall is extremely rare, occurring in measurable
amounts in only one in 10 years.

2.4

FLORA AND FAUNA

Harris County is situated near the southeastern edge of the Texas biotic province (Blair
1950), an intermediate zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian provinces
and the grasslands of the Kansas, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces. Some species reach
the limits of their ecological range within the Texas province. McMahan et al. (1984) further define
four broad communities that characterize that portion of the Texas biotic province that lies on the
Gulf Coastal Plain: (1) coastal marsh/barrier island, (2) coastal prairie, (3) coastal gallery forest,
and (4) pine-hardwood forest (cf. Abbott 2001:24-26).
The coastal marsh/barrier island category includes well-drained, sandy, coastal
environments and saline and freshwater wetlands in the coastal zone (Abbott 2001:24). Marsh
vegetation is typical of areas that are seasonally wet and have substrates composed primarily of
sands and silts, clays, or organic decomposition products. Vegetation assemblages are strongly
controlled by texture, salinity, frequency and duration of inundation, and depth of the seasonal
water table. Sandy, relatively well-drained, freshwater environments are typically dominated by
little bluestem, switchgrass, Florida paspalum, and brownseed paspalum. Wetter environments
are often dominated by marshhay cordgrass, seashore saltgrass, saggitaria, bulrushes, smooth
cordgrass, seashore paspalum, seashore dropseed, olney bulrush, saltmarsh bulrush, saltmarsh
aster, longtom, sprangletop, burhead, arrowhead, coastal waterhyssop, needlegrass rush, and
other sedges and rushes. Slightly higher, better-drained environments are characterized by such
taxa as seashore saltgrass, seashore paspalum, gulfdune paspalum, shoregrass, gulf cordgrass,
red lovegrass, bushy sea-oxey, and glasswort. A variety of fauna are characteristic of the shore
zone. Important larger taxa include raccoon, nutria, alligators, turtles, swamp rabbit, and many
birds, including ducks, geese, herons, and many smaller species. Aquatic taxa, including a wealth
of fish and shellfish adapted to brackish to hypersaline conditions, are also important in the coastal
zone.
The coastal prairie category consists primarily of grasses with minor amounts of forbs and
woody plants in areas that are not saturated on a seasonal basis (Abbott 2001:24-26). This
community is characteristic of upland areas and grades into the pine-hardwood forest to the north
and east and into the coastal marsh/barrier island to the south. A wide variety of grasses are
found in the prairie environments, but the principal taxa include big bluestem, little bluestem,
indiangrass, eastern grama, switchgrass, brownseed paspalum, sideoats grama, silver bluestem,
buffalograss, threeawn, and Texas wintergrass. Common forbs include Maximilian sunflower,
Engelman daisy, blacksalmon, penstemon, dotted gayfeather, bundleflower, yellow neptunia,
snoutbean, prairie clover, tickclover, wildbean, western indigo, paintbrush, bluebonnet, ragweed,

croton, milkweed, vetch, verbena, and winecup. Woody plants occurring in the coastal prairie
include mesquite, honey locust, huisache, eastern baccharis, sesbania, live oak, elm, hackberry,
bumelia, and coralberry. The frequency of trees increases dramatically as the coastal prairie
grades into the pine-hardwood forest, forming an open woodland environment with common
stands of hardwood trees and occasional pines. The coastal prairie is home to a diverse fauna,
including coyote, white-tailed deer, skunks, cottontail rabbit, many small rodents, amphibians,
reptiles, and a variety of permanent and migratory birds. Bison and pronghorn were also present
at various times in the past.
The coastal gallery forest consists of diverse, principally deciduous trees and associated
understory in floodplains and streams that traverse the outer coastal plain (Abbott 2001:26).
Important taxa include water oak, pecan, poplar, American elm, cedar elm, sugarberry, ash,
loblolly pine, post oak, cherrybark oak, mulberry, swamp chestnut oak, willow oak, sweetgum,
hawthorn, dogwood, hickory, bois d’arc, sassafras cypress, willow, cottonwood, and sumac.
Shrubs and vines such as mustang grape, greenbriar, yaupon, coralberry, possumhaw,
elderberry, honeysuckle, dewberry, and blackberry are common in the understory, as are grasses
such as little bluestem, big bluestem, and indiangrass. The fauna of the gallery forest include
white-tailed deer, opossum, raccoon, squirrel, turkey, a variety of small mammals and rodents,
turtles, snakes, and many birds. Black bear was also present at various times in the past, and a
number of fish and a few varieties of shellfish are present in the streams.
The pine-hardwood forest is characterized by a mix of coniferous and deciduous trees,
including longleaf pine, shortleaf pine, loblolly pine, post oak, red oak, white oak, blackjack oak,
willow oak, and live oak (Abbott 2001:26). Riparian environments often support larger deciduous
trees like pecan, cottonwood, hickory, beech, and American elm. Understory vegetation varies
from relatively open to quite dense, and consists of shrubs, vines, forbs, and young trees.
Common shrubs include acacia, yaupon, mayhaw, wild persimmon, myrtle, greenbriar, Virginia
creeper, blackberry, dewberry, trumpet vine, gourd, and poison ivy. A variety of fauna is also
present, including white-tailed deer, opossum, raccoon, squirrel, rabbit, mink, skunk, various small
rodents, turtles, reptiles, and many different birds. Black bear was also present at times in the
past, and bison and pronghorn were occasionally present in the transition zone to the coastal
prairie environment.

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The Project Area is located within the Southeast Texas Archeological Region, a 21-county
area extending from the Colorado River on the west to the Sabine River on the east and
measuring about 199.6 km (124.0 miles) inland from the Gulf of Mexico coastline. Much of the
archeological record in Southeast Texas represents an interface between the Southern Great
Plains and the Southeastern Woodlands (Aten 1983, 1984; Patterson 1995; Story 1990). Further
distinctions are often made between the inland and coastal margin subregions of Southeast
Texas. These two subregions are somewhat culturally distinct, and the inland subregion has a
much longer chronological record. The coastal margin of Southeast Texas comprises a zone
about 25.7 km (16.0 miles) inland from the coast that covers the area influenced by Gulf tidal
flows on the salinity of streams, lakes, and bays. Considerable ecological variability characterizes
this subregion, including woodlands, coastal prairie, lakes, wetlands, marine coastline, and barrier
islands. The inland subregion also encompasses considerable ecological diversity, including
mixed woodlands, coastal prairies, and dense piney woods.
The human inhabitants of Southeast Texas practiced a generally nomadic hunting and
gathering lifestyle throughout all of prehistory. While many of the same labels are used to denote
Southeast Texas cultural/chronological periods, the timeframe and cultural characteristics of
Southeast Texas culture periods are often different than in neighboring regions. For instance, the
Archaic and Late Prehistoric time periods are different in Central and Southeast Texas, and
Central Texas lacks the Early Ceramic period that has been defined for Southeast Texas.
Mobility and settlement patterns do not appear to have changed markedly through time in
Southeast Texas. Inland sites are usually found near a water source, usually exhibit evidence of
reoccupation through time, have well-defined intrasite activity areas, tend not to be associated
with satellite activity sites or separate base camps, and exhibit a range of subsistence-related
activities. Inland sites also tend to contain modest pottery assemblages, fired clay balls (at some
sites), abundant lithic material, and an absence of shell tools. Coastal sites tend to consist of
multicomponent Rangia shell middens that contain oyster shell tools, large quantities of pottery
(in later cultural components), numerous bone tools, and only a few lithic artifacts.

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (10,000 TO 5000 B.C.)

The initial human occupations in the New World can now be confidently extended back
before 10,000 B.C. (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990;

BOA439-11165T

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans
were present in Eastern North America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al.
1990), while more recent discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for
human occupation in South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer
et al. 1997). Most archeologists have historically discounted claims of much earlier human
occupation during the Pleistocene glacial period. However, recent investigations of the Buttermilk
Creek Complex in Bell County, Texas, have raised the possibility that a pre-Clovis culture may
have been present in North America as early as 15,500 years ago (Waters et al. 2011).
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Southeast Texas is represented
by the PaleoIndian period (10,000 to 5000 B.C.) (Patterson 1995). This stage coincided with
ameliorating climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that witnessed the
extinction of herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing various periods
within this stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often fluted, lanceolate
projectile points. These points are frequently associated with spurred end-scrapers, gravers, and
bone foreshafts.
PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized into egalitarian bands
consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic subsistence and settlement
pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence patterns in Southeast Texas are
known primarily through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence focused on the exploitation of
small animals, fish, and shellfish, even during the PaleoIndian period. There is little evidence in
this region for hunting of extinct megafauna, as has been documented elsewhere in North
America; rather, a broad-based subsistence pattern appears to have been practiced during all
prehistoric time periods.
In Southeast Texas, the PaleoIndian stage is divided into two periods based on
recognizable differences in projectile point styles (Patterson 1995). These include the Early
PaleoIndian period (10,000 to 8000 B.C.), which is recognized based on large, fluted projectile
points (i.e., Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Big Sandy), and the Late PaleoIndian period
(8000 to 5000 B.C.), which is characterized by unfluted lanceolate points (i.e., Plainview,
Scottsbluff, Meserve, and Angostura).

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (5000 B.C. TO A.D. 100)

The onset of the Hypsithermal drying trend signaled the beginning of the Archaic stage
(5000 B.C. to A.D. 100) (Patterson 1995). This climatic trend marked the beginning of a
significant reorientation of lifestyle throughout most of North America, but this change was far less
pronounced in Southeast Texas. Elsewhere, the changing climatic conditions and corresponding
decrease in the big game populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a diversified
resource base composed of smaller game and wild plants. In Southeast Texas, however, this
hunting and gathering pattern is characteristic of most of prehistory. The appearance of a more
diversified tool kit, the development of an expanded groundstone assemblage, and a general
decrease in the size of projectile points are hallmarks of this cultural stage. Material culture shows
greater diversity during this broad cultural period, especially in the application of groundstone
technology.

30

Drainage Improvements Project, Pasadena, Harris County, Texas

Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods. In
Southeast Texas, the Early Archaic period (5000 to 3000 B.C.) is marked by the presence of Bell,
Carrollton, Morrill, Trinity, Wells, and miscellaneous Early Stemmed projectile points. The Bell
point is the only type in this period that is closely associated with the Southern Plains. Many of
the latter point types continue into the Middle Archaic period (3000 to 1500 B.C.) and several new
types appear, including Bulverde, Lange, Pedernales, Williams, Travis, and probably the GaryKent series. The Late Archaic period (1,500 B.C. to A.D. 100) is characterized by Gary, Kent,
Darl, Yarbrough, Ensor, Ellis, Fairland, Palmillas, and Marcos points.
In the western part of inland Southeast Texas, a Late Archaic mortuary tradition developed
in the lower Brazos and Colorado river valleys and in the intervening area (Hall 1981; Patterson
1995). Organized burial practices actually started during the Middle Archaic period but reached
full development in the Late Archaic with the use of exotic grave goods such as boatstones and
bannerstones (probably used as atlatl weights), stone gorgets, corner-tang knives, stingray
spines, shark teeth, and marine shell beads and pendants. Other burial practices included the
systematic orientation of burial direction, body position, use of red ochre, and use of locally made
grave goods, such as longbone implements and bone pins. Most burials are found in extended
supine position, though some extended prone and bundle burials are also known. Burial direction
is usually consistent within single sites but varies from site to site. Patterson et al. (1993) report
that at least 11 sites are associated with this mortuary tradition in Austin, Fort Bend, and Wharton
counties.

3.3

EARLY CERAMIC PERIOD (A.D. 100 TO 600)

The use of pottery did not start uniformly throughout Southeast Texas. Pottery
manufacture appears to have diffused into this region from adjacent regions, primarily from the
east along the coastal margin. Aten (1983:297) argues that pottery was being manufactured on
the coastal margin of the Texas-Louisiana border by about 70 B.C., in the Galveston Bay area by
about A.D. 100, in the western part of the coastal margin by about A.D. 300, and in the ConroeLivingston inland area by about A.D. 500. The practice of pottery manufacture appears to have
progressed first along the coastal margin and then moved inland (Patterson 1995). Southeastern
Texas ceramic chronologies are best known in the Galveston Bay area, where Aten (1983)
established a detailed chronological sequence.
The earliest ceramic periods in the Galveston Bay and neighboring Sabine Lake areas
appear to be approximately contemporaneous with the earliest ceramic periods of the lower
Mississippi Valley (Aten 1984). Early assemblages contain substantial quantities of Tchefuncte
ceramics. In the Sabine Lake region, grog-tempered varieties of Baytown Plain and Marksville
Stamped are common while grog-tempered ceramics do not occur in the Galveston Bay area
128.7 km (80.0 miles) to the west until several hundred years later. With the principal exception
of a few Tchefuncte ceramic types, other southern Louisiana ceramics are not found on the Gulf
coast west of the Sabine Lake area.
Goose Creek sandy-paste pottery was used throughout Southeast Texas and somewhat
farther north in the Early Ceramic, Late Prehistoric, and the early part of the Historic periods (Aten
1984; Patterson 1995; Perttula et al. 1995). The Goose Creek series is the primary utility ware

BOA439-11165T

31

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

throughout the prehistoric sequence in Southeast Texas, though it gives way to Baytown Plain for
about 200 years during the transition between the Late Prehistoric and Historic periods before
once again becoming predominant into the Historic period (Aten 1984). A minor variety, Goose
Creek Stamped, occurs only in the Early Ceramic period (Aten 1983). Three other minor pottery
types—Tchefuncte (Plain and Stamped), Mandeville, and O’Neal Plain variety Conway (Aten
1983)—were used only during the Early Ceramic period. The Mandeville and Tchefuncte types
are characterized by contorted paste and poor coil wedging. Mandeville has sandy paste (like
Goose Creek), while Tchefuncte paste has relatively little sand. Given their technological
similarities, Mandeville and Tchefuncte may represent different clay sources rather than distinct
pottery types (Patterson 1995). The bone-tempered pottery that characterizes ceramic
assemblages elsewhere in Texas is not common in Southeast Texas.

3.4

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 600 TO 1500)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period (A.D. 600 to 1500) (Patterson 1995) is defined by
the appearance of the bow and arrow. Elsewhere in Texas, pottery also appears during the latter
part of the Late Prehistoric period, but, as already discussed, ceramics appear earlier in Southeast
Texas. Along the coastal margin of Southeast Texas, use of the atlatl (i.e., spearthrower) and
spear was generally discontinued during the Late Prehistoric period, though they continued to be
used in the inland subregion along with the bow and arrow through the Late Prehistoric period
(Ensor and Carlson 1991; Keller and Weir 1979; Patterson 1980, 1995; Wheat 1953). In fact,
Patterson (1995:254) proposes that use of the bow and arrow started in Southeast Texas as early
as the end of the Middle Archaic period, using unifacial arrow points that consisted of marginally
retouched flakes. In contrast, Prewitt (1981) argues for a generalized date of adoption of the bowand-arrow hunting system at about the same time (ca. A.D. 600) in Central and Southeast Texas.
In Southeast Texas, unifacial arrow points appear to be associated with a small prismatic blade
technology. Bifacial arrow point types include Alba, Catahoula, Perdiz, and Scallorn. A serial
sequence for these point types has not been established in Southeast Texas, though Scallorn
points appear to predate Perdiz points throughout the rest of Texas.
Grog- (i.e., crushed-sherd-) tempered pottery was used in the Late Prehistoric and
Protohistoric periods in Southeast Texas. The grog-tempered varieties include San Jacinto Plain
and Baytown Plain variety Phoenix Lake. San Jacinto pottery contains a relatively small
proportion of small-sized temper while Baytown Plain has larger amounts of sherd pieces that are
often visible on vessel surfaces. As previously mentioned, sandy-paste Goose Creek pottery
remained in use throughout the Late Prehistoric period. Rockport Plain and Asphalt Coated
pottery from the Central Texas Coast (Ricklis 1995) are found at a few sites in Southeast Texas
during the Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric periods.

3.5

PROTOHISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 1500 TO 1700)

For the most part, Protohistoric and early Historic Indian sites in Southeast Texas have
not been articulated with the ethnographic record (Story 1990:258). Similarly, reconciling the
ethnographic record to prehistoric Indian groups in this region is problematic. Late Prehistoric
and Historic population movements further complicate this issue. Aten (1983) has reconstructed

32

BOA11165_arch_survey_report (rev)

Cultural Resources Investigations Conducted on Select Portions of the Proposed City of Pasadena
Drainage Improvements Project, Pasadena, Harris County, Texas

the territories of native groups present in this region in the early 18th century, including the
Akokisa, Atakapa, Bidai, Coco (possibly Karankawa), and Tonkawa. The presence of the
Tonkawa in Southeast Texas may be due to their rapid expansion from Central Texas in the
17th and 18th centuries (Newcomb 1993:27). The Karankawa Indians are thought to have
occupied the coastal margin of this region as far east as Galveston Island and the corresponding
mainland (Aten 1983). Judging by the scarcity of Rockport pottery on sites east of the San
Bernard River, the ethnic association of the Karankawa Indians with the Coco tribe may be in
doubt.
Protohistoric and Historic Indian sites may not be systematically recognized as such
because few aboriginal artifact types changed from the Late Prehistoric to the Historic periods
(Patterson 1995). Only a few non-European artifact types are useful in identifying Historic Indian
sites, including Bulbar Stemmed and Guerrero arrow points and possibly Fresno and Cuney
points after A.D. 1500 (Hudgins 1986). Historic period Indian sites are usually identified by the
presence of glass and metal artifacts, gunflints, and European types of pottery.

3.6

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. A.D. 1700 TO PRESENT)

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas was in 1519 when Álvarez
de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Álvar Núñez Cabeza de
Vaca crossed South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near Galveston Bay;
however, European settlement did not seriously disrupt native ways of life until after 1700. The
first half of the 18th century was the period in which the fur trade and mission system, as well as
the first effects of epidemic diseases, began to seriously disrupt the native culture and social
systems. This process is clearly discernable at the Mitchell Ridge site, where the burial data
suggest population declines and group mergers (Ricklis 1994) as well as increased participation
on the part of the Native American population in the fur trade. By the time heavy settlement of
Texas began in the early 1800s by Anglo-Americans, the indigenous Indian population was
greatly diminished. The Alabama-Coushatta Indians who currently reside in Southeast Texas are
migrants who were displaced from the east in the late 18th to early 19th centuries (Newcomb
1961).
Although Spain claimed the Texas Gulf Coast, few Europeans visited the future Harris
County between 1528 and 18211. It is possible that de Vaca ascended the San Jacinto River
from Galveston Island around 1529 to trade with the woodland Indians, but his adventures failed
to stimulate interest in the Texas coast. A few French traders from Louisiana visited Indians living
on Spring Creek between the 1730s and 1745, but they established no settlements. A Spanish
mission and presidio complex, El Orcoquisac, was maintained near the mouth of the Trinity from
1756 to 1771 to monitor and oppose the intrusion of foreigners. In 1746, Captain Joaquín de
Orobio y Basterra from La Bahía visited the Orcoquisac villages along Spring Creek while looking
for French traders. He reported the lack of roads or maps and, on his return, blazed a trail
westward to find the Old San Antonio Road, on which he had traveled to Nacogdoches on his

way to the lower Trinity and San Jacinto rivers. The first Anglo-Americans to explore Harris
County were members of the various filibustering expeditions launched from New Orleans
between 1815 and 1820 to aid the Mexican Republicans rebelling against Spain. Using Galveston
Island and Bolivar Peninsula as a base, the men belonging to the expeditions and encampments
of Louis Michel Aury, Francisco Xavier Mina, Jean Laffite, and James Long looked around the
San Jacinto estuary for future home sites—their expected reward for freeing Mexico from Spain.
Some of these men were among the pioneer settlers arriving by boat from Louisiana in early 1822,
soon after the Mexican War of Independence.
Pasadena, Texas, was founded in 1893 by John H. Burnett of Galveston and named after
Pasadena, California, due to its lush vegetation. The La Porte, Houston and Northern Railroad
was built through the townsite in 1894 and opened the area for development as a farming
community. Retired Kansas banker Charles R. Munger and land promoter Cora Bacon Foster
were instrumental in organizing the early community. After the Galveston hurricane of 1900, Clara
Barton of the American Red Cross purchased 1.5 million strawberry plants for Gulf Coast farmers.
Pasadena quickly established itself as the strawberry capital of the region. By the 1920s, all of
southeastern Harris County was known as “Pasadena Acres.” In addition to strawberries, the
Pasadena farmers sold cantaloupes, cape jasmine flowers, cucumbers, and other produce. A
private school was established in Pasadena in 1894 and became a part of the Harrisburg
Common School District by 1895. In 1899, Pasadena residents formed an independent school
system, the first in Harris County. A four-year high school program was established in 1924 with
the construction of Pasadena High School. Both the Genoa and South Houston school districts
were consolidated into the Pasadena system in 1935. A union Sunday school was organized in
1893. Adults attended the union church in the nearby community of Deepwater. The Methodists
were the first to form a church in Pasadena in 1896. The Baptists followed in 1898. Both
congregations shared the use of the schoolhouse until the Baptists completed their church
building in 1905. The Methodists erected their building in 1907. The Assembly of God religious
organization was formed shortly thereafter and built a church house.
The citizens of Pasadena voted to incorporate on 22 December 1923 and then elected to
disincorporate on 29 November 1924. They voted finally to incorporate in 1928. The city held
about half the land Burnett had originally platted for his town. At the time of incorporation, water,
electricity, and gas utilities had only recently been brought to the community. Burnett had laid his
town out on the southern bank of Buffalo Bayou, which became the Houston Ship Channel. When
Joseph Stephen Cullinan, founder of Texaco, moved his company to Houston in 1906, he
purchased 80.9 hectares (200.0 acres) in nearby Pasadena. There he operated an experimental
farm for 20 years while he promoted this site and other lands along the ship channel. The Sinclair
(now ARCO), Texaco, and Crown oil companies all built refineries in the area by 1920.
Transition from a farming economy to an industrial one did not occur until the late 1930s
when the war in Europe spurred a major increase in the ship-channel industries. Pasadena had
a population of 3,436 in 1940 and 22,483 in 1950 as the postwar boom continued. It annexed the
communities of Deepwater, Middle Bayou, and Red Bluff. From 4.4 square kilometers
(1.7 square miles) in 1893, the community site grew to 58.6 square miles in 1980 when the city
had a population of 112,560 people. In 1993, Pasadena had a population of 122,805 and 2,147

businesses. By 2000, the population was 141,674 with 3,709 businesses. Employment in
Pasadena is closely linked to the ship-channel industries, Bayport Industrial District, and the
Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in adjacent Clear Lake. San Jacinto College and Texas
Chiropractic College are located in Pasadena. Musical entertainment ranges from the fare at
Gilley’s Country and Western Club to performances of the Pasadena Philharmonic Orchestra.
The Pasadena Historical Museum, Bay Area Museum, Armand Bayou Nature Center, Pasadena
Rodeo, and San Jacinto Strawberry Festival are major tourist attractions.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Prior to initiating fieldwork, Horizon personnel reviewed the THC’s online Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) database, the National Park Service’s (NPS) online National
Register Information System (NRIS), the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory’s (TARL)
files, the Texas Department of Transportation’s (TxDOT) Historic Bridges of Texas and Historic
Districts & Properties of Texas online databases, and the Texas State Historical Association’s
(TSHA) The Handbook of Texas Online for information on previously recorded cultural resources
sites and previous archeological investigations conducted within a 1.6-km (1.0-mile) radius of the
Project Area (NPS 2019; THC 2019; TSHA 2019; TxDOT 2019a, 2019b).
Based on this archival research, three previously recorded archeological sites have been
recorded within a 1.6-km (1.0-mile) radius of the Project Area (Table 4-1 and Figure 4-1). One
cemetery and two historic properties listed on the NRHP have also been recorded within a 1.6km (1.0-mile) radius of the Project Area (Table 4-1). Based on the TASA database, seven prior
cultural resources surveys have conducted within a 1.6-km (1.0-mile) radius of the proposed
Project Area, all of which yielded negative results (THC 2019). These surveys are briefly
discussed below.
In October of 2013, SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) performed an area survey
north and east of the Project Area. The survey was conducted on behalf of NuStar Logistics, L.P.
In May of 2013, Horizon conducted an area survey west of the Project Area. The survey was
performed on behalf of the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE ), Galveston District,
for the BridgeTex Pipeline. In June of 2005, a larger area survey was conducted on behalf of the
TxDOT. In April of 2006, Anthony and Brown Consulting performed a survey north of the Project
Area for the Surface Transportation Board. In January of 1976 Texas A&M performed a survey
on behalf of the USACE. In August of 1986, a survey was performed for the Federal Highway
Administration. In October of 1976, a survey was performed for the Texas Department of
Highway and Public Transportation. As was noted above, all of these prior surveys produced
negative results in the vicinity of the current Project Area.

5.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY

On 24 April 2019, Horizon’s Cultural Resources Director, Jesse Owens, met with Bill
Martin of the THC’s Archeology Division to develop a scope of work that would ensure the city’s
compliance with the ACT and the NHPA. For archeological resources, the THC’s archeological
reviewer indicated that there should be little of concern regarding lowering the elevation of the
streets of Pasadena by one to two feet below their current grade. As such, for purposes of the
archeological survey, Horizon concentrated archeological survey activities on the 11 proposed
detention pond footprints and on four of the proposed street modification projects where they
cross streams, including two on Vince Bayou and two on Little Vince Bayou. Table 5-1 below
summarizes the archeological survey areas, their associated acreages, and survey efforts
performed.
On 30 April and 1 May of 2019, Horizon project archeologist Charles Edward Bludau, Jr.
conducted an intensive archeological resources survey of the Project Area. Jeffrey D. Owens
acted as Principal Investigator, and the survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit No.
8890. The purpose of the survey was to locate any significant archeological resources that
potentially would be impacted by the proposed undertaking. Horizon’s archeologist traversed the
Project Area and thoroughly inspected the modern ground surface for aboriginal and historic-age
archeological resources.
In addition to a pedestrian walkover, the TSMASS require a minimum of 3 shovel tests per
acre for tracts between 0.0 and 2.0 acres in size. Additionally, for areas between 3.0 and
10.0 acres in size, the TSMASS require 2 shovel tests per acre. As such, a minimum of 41 shovel
tests would be required within the Project Area to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon excavated
a total of 59 shovel tests, thereby exceeding the TSMASS for a Project Area of this size (Figures
5-1 through 5-7). In general, shovel tests measured approximately 30.0 cm (11.8 inches) in
diameter, and all sediments were screened through 6.35-millimeter (mm) (0.25-in) hardware cloth.
Summary data for all 59 shovel tests excavated during the survey are presented in Appendix A.
During the survey, field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, landforms,
survey methods, and shovel test results. Digital photographs were taken, and a photographic log
was maintained. Horizon employed a non-collection policy for archeological resources.
Diagnostic artifacts (e.g., projectile points, ceramics, historic materials with maker’s marks) and
nondiagnostic artifacts (e.g., lithic debitage, burned rock, historic glass, and metal scrap) were to
be described, sketched, and/or photo-documented in the field and replaced in the same location

6.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

No archeological sites, historic or prehistoric, were recorded within the Project Area during
the survey. Horizon excavated 59 shovel tests within the Project Area, thereby exceeding the
TSMASS requirements for a Project Area of this size. Based on the overall distribution of shovel
tests within Project Area and the lack of observed archeological resources, it is Horizon’s opinion
that this area was adequately assessed for archeological resources.
Shovel testing typically revealed moderately deep to deep deposits of sandy clay and clay
loams extending to depths of 60.0 cm (23.6 inches) or more below surface. Many shovel tests
contained calcium carbonate inclusions and dense clayey sediments at depths ranging from 30.0
to 60.0 cm (11.8 to 23.6 inches). Many shovel tests exhibited signs of disturbance in near-surface
sediments in the form of heavily mottled clays and pieces of concrete and asphalt.

7.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

7.1

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

The archeological investigations documented in this report were undertaken with three
primary management goals in mind:

•

Locate all historic and prehistoric archeological resources that occur within the
designated survey area.

•

Evaluate the significance of these resources regarding their potential for inclusion in
the NRHP and for designation as SALs.

•

Formulate recommendations for the treatment of these resources based on their
NRHP and SAL evaluations.

At the survey level of investigation, the principal research objective is to inventory the
archeological resources within the APE and to make preliminary determinations of whether or not
the resources meet one or more of the pre-defined eligibility criteria set forth in the state and/or
federal codes, as appropriate. Usually, management decisions regarding archeological
properties are a function of the potential importance of the sites in addressing defined research
needs, though historic-age sites may also be evaluated in terms of their association with important
historic events and/or personages. Under the NHPA and the Antiquities Code of Texas,
archeological resources are evaluated according to criteria established to determine the
significance of archeological resources for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as SALs,
respectively.
Analyses of the limited data obtained at the survey level are rarely sufficient to contribute
in a meaningful manner to defined research issues. The objective is rather to determine which
archeological sites could be most profitably investigated further in pursuance of regional,
methodological, or theoretical research questions. Therefore, adequate information on site
function, context, and chronological placement from archeological and, if appropriate, historical
perspectives is essential for archeological evaluations. Because research questions vary as a
function of geography and temporal period, determination of the site context and chronological
placement of cultural properties is a particularly important objective during the inventory process.

Chapter 7.0: Summary and Recommendations

7.2

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION IN THE NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC
PLACES

Determinations of eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP are based on the criteria presented
in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) in 36 CFR §60.4(a-d). The four criteria of eligibility are
applied following the identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of
location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and:
a. [T]hat are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history; or,
b. [T]hat are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or,
c.

[T]hat embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose
components may lack individual distinction; or,

d. [T]hat have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or
history.

The first step in the evaluation process is to define the significance of the property by
identifying the particular aspect of history or prehistory to be addressed and the reasons why
information on that topic is important. The second step is to define the kinds of evidence or the
data requirements that the property must exhibit to provide significant information. These data
requirements in turn indicate the kind of integrity that the site must possess to be significant. This
concept of integrity relates both to the contextual integrity of such entities as structures, districts,
or archeological deposits and to the applicability of the potential database to pertinent research
questions. Without such integrity, the significance of a resource is very limited.
For an archeological resource to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, it must meet legal
standards of eligibility that are determined by three requirements: (1) properties must possess
significance, (2) the significance must satisfy at least one of the four criteria for eligibility listed
above, and (3) significance should be derived from an understanding of historic context. As
discussed here, historic context refers to the organization of information concerning prehistory
and history according to various periods of development in various times and at various places.
Thus, the significance of a property can best be understood through knowledge of historic
development and the relationship of the resource to other, similar properties within a particular
period of development. Most prehistoric sites are usually only eligible for inclusion in the NRHP
under Criterion D, which considers their potential to contribute data important to an understanding
of prehistory. All four criteria employed for determining NRHP eligibility potentially can be brought
to bear for historic sites.

7.3

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR LISTING AS A STATE ANTIQUITIES LANDMARK

The criteria for determining the eligibility of a prehistoric or historic cultural property for
designation as an SAL are presented in Chapter 191, Subchapter D, Section 191.092 of the
Antiquities Code of Texas, which states that SALs include:
Sites, objects, buildings, artifacts, implements, and locations of historical, archeological,
scientific, or educational interest including those pertaining to prehistoric and historical
American Indians or aboriginal campsites, dwellings, and habitation sites, their artifacts
and implements of culture, as well as archeological sites of every character that are located
in, on, or under the surface of any land belonging to the State of Texas or to any county,
city, or political subdivision of the state are state antiquities landmarks and are eligible for
designation.

For the purposes of assessing the eligibility of a historic property for designation as an
SAL, a historic site, structure, or building has historical interest if the site, structure, or building:
1. [W]as the site of an event that has significance in the history of the United States or
the State of Texas;
2. [W]as significantly associated with the life of a famous person;
3. [W]as significantly associated with an event that symbolizes an important principle or
ideal;
4. [R]epresents a distinctive architectural type and has value as an example of a period,
style, or construction technique; or,
5. [I]s important as part of the heritage of a religious organization, ethic group, or local
society.

The Antiquities Code of Texas establishes the THC as the legal custodian of all cultural
resources, historic and prehistoric, within the public domain of the State of Texas. Under Part II
of Title 13 of the Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26), the THC may designate a historic
building, structure, cultural landscape, or non-archeological site, object, or district as an SAL if it
meets at least one of following criteria:
A. [T]he property is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to
the broad patterns of our history, including importance to a particular cultural or ethnic
group;
B. [T]he property is associated with the lives of persons significant in our past;
C. [T]he property embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, represents the work of a master, possesses high artistic values, or
represents a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack
individual distinction;
D. [T]he property has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in Texas
culture or history.

BOA439-11165T

55

Chapter 7.0: Summary and Recommendations

Furthermore, the THC may designate an archeological site as an SAL if the site meets
one or more of the following criteria:
1. [T]he site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory
and/or history of Texas by the addition of new and important information;
2. [T]he site’s archeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and
intact, thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;
3. [T]he site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or
history;
4. [T]he study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of
preservation, thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge; or,
5. [T]he high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur,
and official landmark designation is needed to ensure maximum legal protection, or
alternatively further investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and
relic collecting when the site cannot be protected.

7.4

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the results of the survey-level investigations documented in this report, no
potentially significant archeological resources would be affected by the proposed undertaking. In
accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, Horizon has made a reasonable and good-faith effort to identify
historic properties within the Project Area. No archeological resources were identified within the
Project Area that meet the criteria for designation as SALs according to 13 TAC 26 or for inclusion
in the NRHP under 36 CFR 60.4. Horizon recommends a finding of “no historic properties
affected,” and no further archeological work is recommended in connection with the proposed
undertaking. However, human burials, both prehistoric and historic, are protected under the
Texas Health and Safety Code. In the event that any human remains or burial objects are
inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance in the
Project Area, even in previously surveyed areas, all work should cease immediately in the vicinity
of the inadvertent discovery, and the THC should be notified immediately.
