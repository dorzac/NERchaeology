Abstract
This report presents an evaluation of high-resolution geophysical survey data collected within a portion of
Block 775, Mustang Island Area. The data have been assessed for evidence of high probability areas for
prehistoric occupations and shipwrecks. Fugro GeoServices, Inc. acquired the high quality geophysical
data aboard the Miss Emma McCall on December 4 and 5, 2013. Work was completed under Texas
Antiquities Permit No. 6696. The cultural resources remote-sensing survey encompassed over 219 acres
of water bottom and involved approximately 132,872.00 linear feet (25.2 linear miles) of survey.
Findings submitted in this report are based on the interpretation of side scan sonar, magnetometer,
subbottom profiler, and bathymetry data sets. The data have been assessed for evidence of shipwrecks
and high probability areas for prehistoric archaeological sites associated with formerly subaerially
exposed landforms.
The results of the high-resolution geophysical survey included the identification of five hundred and
ninety-seven (597) mappable reef objects (cement pyramids and cement culverts). These objects were
noted within the central and northwestern portions of the survey area within a proposed reef boundary.
There were no unidentified magnetic anomalies noted outside of the proposed reef area containing the
cement pyramids and culverts.
Four (4) side scan sonar contacts were noted within the survey area. All sonar contacts noted within the
survey area are interpreted as debris targets associated with former construction, fishing, or shipping
activities. No sonar contacts are deemed archaeologically significant.
There were no unusual depressions, scours, sediment changes, unidentified magnetic anomalies or
unidentified seafloor targets observed within the survey area that could represent unidentified shipwreck
remains. There were also no landforms identified within the survey area that could be considered as high
probability areas for prehistoric occupations.

Introduction

This report presents an evaluation of high-resolution geophysical survey data collected within a portion of
Block 775, Mustang Island Area (MU775). The survey area is located within state waters just inside of
the Texas State Seaward Boundary (3 league line). The data have been assessed for evidence of high
probability areas for prehistoric occupations and shipwrecks.
This study was conducted for the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) to meet requirements
under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). Section 106 requires federally
funded or permitted projects to give consideration to historic and prehistoric cultural resources. A review
of the Council of Texas Archaeologistsâ (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resource Management (CRM)
Reports indicates that contents for a Short Report must include the following: Definition of Study Area,
Management Summary, Research Design, Results, and Recommendations. The following report follows
the guidelines set forth by the CTA. The Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas Natural Resource Code, Title
9, Chapter 191) was reviewed for compliance and guidance. This report also complies with guidelines set
forth within the Texas Administrative Code.
Fugro GeoServices, Inc. conducted the high-resolution geophysical survey within MU775 on December 4
and 5, 2013. The purpose of the survey was to clear an area encompassing approximately 219 acres of
water bottom for a proposed artificial reef site. The survey was conducted aboard the Miss Emma
McCall. Geophysical systems deployed included the Odom Echotrac Fathometer MKlll, EdgeTech 4200
side scan sonar, SeaSpy Magnetometer and GeoPulse Pinger Sub-bottom Profiler.

II. Prehistoric Cultural Resources Evaluation
The initial emergence and subsequent settlement of prehistoric hunters and gatherers into the new world
has long been a controversial issue within the archaeological community. It is generally accepted that the
first human inhabitants of the Western Hemisphere came from northeast Asia during the last glacial
period via the Bering Land Bridge, which connected Alaska and Siberia during various glacial periods.
Once across, these small bands of hunters and gatherers, following herds of megafauna such as
mammoths, mastodons, ancient bison, and caribou, migrated from Alaska southward through Canada in
an âice-free corridorâ located between the two parts of the Canadian ice sheet, the Laurentide to the east
and the Cordilleran to the west. The exact date of when this southward migration took place is a source
of debate among current archaeological researchers. Some researchers contend the first wave of
inhabitants in the new world migrated southward during the Wisconsin glaciation, sometime prior to
25,000 B.C., however there is virtually no definitive empirical evidence in the archaeological record to
support such claims.
The vast majority of American archaeologists adhere to a more conservative estimate of a southward
migration of people sometime at the end of the Late Wisconsin Age (13,000 B.C. - 10,000 B.C.).
Securely dated and widely accepted human settlements, such as the Lehner and Murray Springs sites in
Arizona, that possess a mean age from 21 samples of 11,000Â±200 years seem to support a definite
migration of New World inhabitants at least by the end of the Late Wisconsin Age (Bense 1994). In any
event, by approximately 10,000 B.C., these new inhabitants had settled most of the geographical area
south of the ice sheets, up to and including the tip of South America.
Paleo-Indian sites such as Avery Island, Louisiana and Wascissa River and Little Salt Spring, Florida
indicate that human occupation of the gulf coast of North America had occurred by 12,000 years B.P.
However, it was not until the following Archaic Period (8,000 â 1,000 B.C.) that native populations began
to actively occupy terrestrial landforms that are now submerged along the gulf coast. A vibrocoring
project conducted by Coastal Environments, Inc. (1986) within the relict Sabine River System located
offshore Texas resulted in the recovery of Rangia cuneata shell deposits and quantities of burned and
unburned bone material from relict river terraces buried 5-6 meters and 16-18 meters below the seafloor.
These materials were radiocarbon dated to 8,055 +90 years B.P. Preservation of prehistoric cultural
resource materials within marine sites is particularly vulnerable to high-energy environments associated
with wave attack during initial sea level transgressions. Archaeological artifacts that have been covered
by fine-grained sediments within low-energy depositional environments, such as floodplains, river
terraces, point bars, bays, lagoons, ponds, subsiding deltas, and sinkholes, prior to marine transgression
will be afforded the best opportunity for preservation (Stright, 1986). The identification of such landforms
in presently submerged areas would represent high probability areas for prehistoric archaeological sites.

III. Historic Cultural Resources Evaluation
The regional probability for shipwrecks in this area is considered to be moderate; preservation of a wreck
would be moderate to good (Pearson et al. 2003). Analyses of available shipwreck sources, as well as
the FUGRO CHANCE database, indicate that four shipwrecks have been reported within close proximity
to the current survey area. The information for the reported shipwrecks are listed below:

The Texas General Land Office (GLO) website contains Resource Management Codes (RMS) for lease
blocks within Texas state waters. These codes are obtained from the Texas Historical Commission
(THC). The THC code for Block 775, Mustang Island Area is MA, which means it is not considered a high
probability tract for the presence of shipwrecks.
The Texas Historical Commissionâs Archaeological Site Atlas does not list any shipwrecks noted within
Block 775, Mustang Island Area. However, two (2) shipwrecks are listed within adjacent lease blocks.

It is important to note that although there are many sources of information for reported shipwreck
locations in the Gulf of Mexico Region (i.e.: Automated Wreck and Obstruction Information System
(AWOIS), Hangs and Obstructions (HO), Coastal Environments Inc. (baseline study, etc.), many of these
lists are primarily based on secondary sources of information. Shipwreck location coordinates are often
inaccurate, and many only contain information concerning large, twentieth century commercial craft.
There have been numerous commercial vessels from the colonial and historic periods reported off the
coast of Texas whose wreck sites remain undetermined. The numerous incidents of early colonial and
historic period vessels and small craft losses are usually overlooked in these references. The
coordinates for many wrecks reported before the mid-20th century are often imprecise, and the wrecks
may drift, settling on bottom some distance from the reported locations. It is therefore possible for earlier
commercial craft and/or private vessels to be located within the survey area.
The degree to which a shipwreck is preserved is dependent upon multiple factors. Hull composition,
sediment type, water depth, wave energy, depth of burial, and biological activity all play a vital role in
determining the preservation of the vessel and its associated cargo.
Studies conducted by Garrison et al. (1989a and 1989b), Muckelroy (1998), and others suggest that
shipwrecks located in low energy environments with fine-grained seafloor sediments have the highest
probability for preservation. Conversely, shipwrecks located in high energy, dynamic environments with
coarser grained seafloor sediments have the lowest probability for preservation. Based on this model, the
Report No. 2413-1071

areas within the Gulf of Mexico region that would afford the highest probability for shipwreck preservation
would include the continental shelf region in the northwestern portion of the Gulf, specifically the area
west of the Mississippi River delta. The area of the Gulf where shipwreck preservation would be
considered to be low would include the majority of the Gulf of Mexico region east of the Mississippi River
delta. While this model is generally applicable to most parts of the continental shelf region of the Gulf of
Mexico, exceptions would include coastal areas such as bays and lagoons where protection from full
exposure to wave energy would be anticipated.
Wooden hulled vessels are subject to biological degradation, such as toredo worms, and destruction of
exposed vessel sections by wave action, currents, and storms. While metal-hulled vessels largely remain
intact, corrosion and colonization can have detrimental effects on the structural integrity of the shipâs hull
and superstructure.
Identification and interpretation of shipwreck remains based on high-resolution geophysical data is a
complex and highly variable process. Attempts to differentiate between modern ferromagnetic debris and
shipwrecks have been conducted by numerous marine archaeologists such as Arnold (1982), Saltus
(1986), Gearhart (1988), and others, with variable degrees of success. An analysis and compilation of
these studies by Garrison et al. (1989a and 1989b) resulted in the outlining of several salient criteria in
differentiating between the two types of anomalies. The study found that magnetic anomalies indicative
of shipwreck sites include: multiple peak anomalies, anomalies with spatial frequency, differential
amplitude anomalies, anomalies spread over a 10,000 m2 area or greater, anomalies with long durations,
and anomalies with axial or linear configurations. Individually, these anomaly types may not be indicative
of high probabilities for the existence of a shipwreck within a given area; however, the probability for the
presence of a shipwreck should be considered high where these types of anomalies co-occur.
Side scan sonar, when used in conjunction with a magnetometer, can aid in identifying shipwreck
remains. Seafloor depressions, scours, and geometrically complex contacts are common sonar contacts
associated with known shipwreck sites throughout the Gulf of Mexico region. In areas where hard
seafloor bottoms exist, wreck debris may be visually identifiable resting on the seafloor.
Bathymetric and sub-bottom profiler systems may also prove useful in the identification of shipwreck
remains within a survey area. In those instances where a survey trackline passes directly over a buried
shipwreck, a diffraction anomaly, much like those observed over pipelines, may be visible. Where
multibeam bathymetric systems are used, shipwrecks partially or fully exposed may appear as
topographic anomalies rising above the surrounding ambient seafloor.

IV. Methods
Remote-Sensing Survey
Fugro GeoServices, Inc. acquired the high quality geophysical data aboard the Miss Emma McCall on
December 4 and 5, 2013. Sea conditions during data acquisition were moderate with seas ranging from
4 to 6 feet and winds from 15 to 20 knots. The quality of the geophysical data collected aboard the
survey vessel was good. Horizontal positioning of the survey vessel was accomplished with the FUGRO
STARFIXï£¨ Differential Global Positioning System, which has a field accuracy of Â±1 meter. Geophysical
systems deployed included the Odom Echotrac Fathometer MKlll, EdgeTech 4200 side scan sonar,
SeaSpy Magnetometer and GeoPulse Pinger Sub-bottom Profiler.
Survey coverage consists of twenty-seven (27) north-south primary track lines (Lines 100-126) run at a
30-meter (~98.4 feet) line spacing and nine (9) east-west tie-lines (Lines 200-208) run at a 100-meter
(~328 feet) line spacing. To ensure record quality, several track lines were rerun and designated with a
letter suffix (Line 125A being a rerun of Line 125). Navigational fixes (shot points) were recorded and
annotated at 410-feet (125-meter) intervals on all data and the study maps. The cultural resources

remote-sensing survey encompassed over 219 acres of water bottom and involved approximately
132,872.00 linear feet (25.2 linear miles) of survey. The survey grid was designed to provide complete
coverage of the seafloor with the sonar and a thorough sampling with all other systems.

Data Processing
During the cultural resources remote-sensing survey, the Echotrac DF3200 MKIII bathymetric data was
collected using Starfix.NAV. The collected bathymetry data was then processed with the collected
navigation data. The soundings were adjusted to compensate for the boat draft and transducer depth.
The digital echo sounder data were converted from two-way traveltime to depths in feet by application of
a harmonic mean velocity function derived from local velocimeter casts. The bathymetric data was then
tide corrected to Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) datum based on the NOAA tide gage at the Bob Hall
Pier, Corpus Cristi (28.58 N, -97.2167 W). The water column velocity data, velocity profile, and tide
tables are included in Appendix B.
The SeaSpy Magnetometer data was collected using Starfix.NAV. Cable layback values were also
recorded using Starfix.NAV. The corrected navigation data as well as the collected layback value data
were processed using Starfix.PROC. The processed navigation data including layback values are
inserted into the collected magnetometer data utilizing Sonarwiz.map. Information regarding the SeaSpy
GSM-19MD Towed Overhauser Magnetometer and the above mentioned processing tools can be found
in Appendix C.
The Edgetech 4200 side scan sonar data was collected in raw XTF format utilizing Sonarwiz.map.
Navigation and cable layback values were recorded with Starfix.NAV. The corrected navigation data as
well as the collected layback value data were processed using Starfix.PROC. The raw XTFs were then
merged with corrected navigation data and processed utilizing Sonarwiz.MAP. Information regarding the
EdgeTech Model 4200 Side-Scan Sonar and the above mentioned processing tools can be found in
Appendix C.

Data Interpretation
Once the Towed Overhauser Magnetometer data was processed, Fugro researchers began interpretation
of the data utilizing SonarWiz for the identification of potential shipwreck sites. As it is impossible to
associate a specific magnetic signature to a shipwreck, more intensive methods of identifying shipwrecks
must be employed when interpreting magnetometer data. These methods include the characteristics of
the individual anomalies, association with other magnetic anomalies or side scan sonar contacts,
negative to positive amplitude ratio, and continuity.
The earth has an ambient magnetic field that ferrous metal objects deviate from. The magnetometer
detects these disruptions in the magnetic field. Because of this, the use of the magnetometer to locate
th
and identify shipwrecks is the most common and efficient method. All ships whether 16 century
th
wooden-hulled vessels or 20 century metal-hulled vessels have a magnetic signature. This is because
much of the metal used in the components of a ship are ferrous in origin.
One of the most widely used methods for identifying shipwrecks is the strength and duration of the
magnetic anomaly. Studies have shown that shipwrecks tend to have a magnetic strength greater than
50 gammas and durations of 80 feet or greater, âthe amplitude of magnetic anomalies associated with
shipwrecks vary considerably but in general the signature of large watercraft or portions of watercraft
range from moderate to high intensity (>50 gammas) when the sensor is at distances of 20 feet or soâ
(Pearson et al. 1990:70). In a recent report (Linden and Pearson 2014:12), Pearson has refined the
duration in this interpretative model to include magnetic targets of 50 gammas with a duration greater
than 65 feet.

Report No. 2413-1071

Another method used was anomaly form. Magnetic anomalies are presented in the magnetic record as a
monopole, dipole, or complex anomaly. A monopole is a single spike or dip in the data stream. A dipole
occurs when a reading goes above and below the ambient magnetic field. A complex reading occurs
when there are several monopoles and dipoles grouped together as a single anomaly. Researchers
looked at the whether the anomaly was a monopole, dipole or complex formation. Shipwrecks were
thought to be dipoles or complex anomalies.
A cluster of magnetic anomalies that range in amplitude and duration is also another method used in the
identification of shipwrecks. Often a shipwreck occurs during a situation that results in damage to the
vessel. This means that as the vessel is sinking, parts of the ship are breaking or falling off. These
artifacts can leave a trail or debris field along the seafloor. Since many items within a ship are ferrous
metal these artifacts have their own distinct magnetic signature.
In recent years the methods have changed as a study conducted by Gearhart (2004) found that the
magnetic signature of a shipwreck tends to orient towards magnetic north. There are two different types
of magnetic orientation that a magnetometer can detect from an object. The first is permanent
magnetization and the second is induced magnetization. Individual artifacts with ferrous metal content
have a magnetic orientation created when the metal is heated above 770Â°C. This magnetic orientation is
set in whichever direction magnetic north is relative to the location the artifact is created. This magnetic
signature is known as the permanent magnetization. Permanent magnetization is much stronger that
induced magnetization on an individual object so when a group of these artifacts, each with their own
permanent magnetic orientation, are grouped together they cancel each other out. This leaves the
induced magnetic orientation as the strongest magnetic signature for a shipwreck. The induced
magnetization occurs after the artifact has cooled. This magnetization is a result of any movement of the
object where a very small number of particles in the object realign with true magnetic north.
In using this concept put forth by Gearhart, the best method to see whether a magnetic anomaly has a
stronger induced or permanent orientation is through contouring. Contoured magnetometer data will
show the orientation of a magnetic anomaly. If the anomaly has a stronger induced magnetization then
the negative polarity will point to magnetic north and the positive polarity will point to magnetic south (in
the northern hemisphere). If the anomaly has a stronger permanent magnetization then the polarity of the
anomaly could point in any direction (Gearhart 2011).
Fugro GeoServices Inc. researchers interpreted the magnetometer data utilizing SonarWiz processing
and interpretation software. Each survey line was reviewed for disruptions in the earthâs magnetic field.
Once all survey lines were reviewed for magnetic anomalies, the researcherâs interpretation was exported
in DXF format to be imported in AutoCAD for the production of Study Maps.
The use of side scan sonar to detect shipwrecks has become the main method for deep water wrecks.
However for shallow waters it is used in conjunction with magnetometer data. Side scan sonar images of
shipwrecks, depending on sonar strength, often are complex with varying widths lengths and heights
within a single contact. As with magnetometer anomalies side scan sonar contacts of shipwrecks can
exhibit a trail or debris field. Finally a combination of multiple sonar contacts and magnetic anomalies
would signify a potential shipwreck.
Fugro GeoServices Inc. researchers interpreted the side scan sonar data utilizing SonarWiz processing
and interpretation software. Each survey line was reviewed for potential debris targets or disturbed
seafloor sediments. Once all survey lines were reviewed for sonar targets, the researcherâs interpretation
was exported in DXF format to be imported in AutoCAD for the production of Study Maps.

V. Results
Bathymetry Analysis
The water depths were contoured at a one-foot contour interval as displayed on the enclosed
Archaeological Map (Map 2). Water depths range from 72 feet to 75 feet below mean lower low water.
Bathymetric profiles reveal a smooth slope to the southeast (Figure No. 3).
There were no topographic anomalies identified on the bathymetry data that could be interpreted as
possible shipwreck remains or relict coastal landforms.

Subbottom Profiler Analysis
The lowering of sea level during the Late Wisconsin Age was a response to expansion of the glacial ice
sheets in the polar regions of the continents. By the time of maximum glaciation, the storage of water in
the glaciers resulted in the lowering of sea level from about 300 to 500 feet below the present high stand.
This maximum Late Wisconsin sea level recession occurred between 24,000 and 12,000 years ago, and
much of the continental shelf was exposed as dry land at this time. The drop in sea level led to a
progressive lowering of stream base levels, and rivers entrenched channels and valleys into the upper
Pleistocene strata; the Pleistocene horizon outside the river courses became overconsolidated by
oxidation and weathering. Eventually climatic conditions warmed, and the meltwater runoff from the polar
ice caps gradually raised sea level. During this Late Wisconsin/Holocene transgression, there was a
gradual reduction in the gradients of the rivers entering the Gulf of Mexico, and the associated reduction
in carrying capacity of the rivers brought on a progressive infilling of channels and entrenched valleys.
The subbottom profiles were examined for evidence of former subaerial landforms that could have been
inhabited by prehistoric human groups. Regional geologic interpretations presented by Berryhill (1981 &
1986) have been reviewed to develop an overall framework for the observed subbottom features. Berryhill
reports that during the Late Wisconsin low stand, the area of Mustang Island Area was situated within a
Pleistocene coastal plain environment that was bordered to the west by ancient stream channels.
Regional studies in the area indicate Late Wisconsin/Holocene sediment thickness in the area is
approximately 50 feet thick.
It is possible that early Archaic and Paleo Indian sites could be present in currently submerged areas of
the continental shelf. Predictive modeling based on correlations between prehistoric archaeological sites
and geomorphic landforms on the Gulf Coastal plain that have been proposed by CEI (1977, 1982, 1986),
Aten (1983), Gagliano (1984), Stright (1986, 1990) and others suggest that Paleo Indian and early
Archaic period sites may be located along the natural levees, margins, point bars, and terraces of alluvial
streams, the margins of lakes and estuaries, relict beach ridges, and the crests of exposed salt domes.
The identification of such features on presently submerged portions of the shelf would indicate high
probability areas for prehistoric archaeological sites.
Various models have been proposed for site preservation during inundation. Sites covered by sediments
in a low-energy environment should be well preserved, such as those adjacent to lakes and lagoons.
Silts and clays provide greater cohesiveness and more stability of the matrix surrounding site
components, and can delay or prevent oxidation or decay of organic remains (Stright 1986; Grebmeier
1983). Sites associated with sands and gravels, indicative of deposition in high-energy environments, are
not as likely to remain in situ, although prehistoric artifacts could be present as lag deposits. Belknap and
Kraft, with others, (1981, 1983, 1985), whose work focused on the Atlantic continental shelf off of
Delaware and Maryland, propose that site preservation is also related to pretransgressive topography and
sedimentation. Within a river valley, sites situated on the valley floor, or at the foot of the valley wall, may
be protected by marsh and lagoonal muds. When inundation of the valley occurs during a rapid sea level
rise, the destructive force of shoreface erosion rises up along the valley wall, above the protected sites on

Report No. 2413-1071

the floor and at the wall base. However, a slow rise in sea level would expose these areas for a longer
period of time to the wave base and wave front erosion.
The subbottom profiler data recorded acoustic penetration to approximately 25 to 40 feet below the
seafloor (Figure Nos. 5 & 6). The sediment sequence consists of continuous, parallel, variable amplitude
reflectors overlying gas saturated sediments. Three small acoustic voids were noted in the southern
portion of the survey area (Figure No. 5). These acoustic voids were approximately 15 feet wide and the
absence of acoustic reflectivity within these areas may be related to seismic signal attenuation within slightly
gas saturated, thinly laminated clays. Geotechnical properties of sediments within these acoustic voids may
differ from the surrounding sediments. Also, several gas plumes were noted in the northwest quadrant of
the survey area (Figure No. 6). These features were very narrow in extent and did not appear to extend to
the seafloor. All features noted within the subbottom profiles appear as isolated features and were not
noted as continuous over multiple survey lines. Therefore, features noted were not plotted on the enclosed
study maps.
The subbottom profiles across the survey area reflect Holocene deposits. Strata beneath the Holocene
deposits are obscured by dispersed gas saturation within former coalescing deltaic lobes covering the
Pleistocene plain. The Holocene/Pleistocene Unconformity was not resolved in the subbottom profiles. No
buried river channels were noted within the Holocene strata.
The Pleistocene surface within the current survey area was subaerially exposed during the last low sea level
cycle associated with the Late Wisconsin glacial advance. Maximum sea level recession occurred
approximately 18,000 to 20,000 years ago at a level of -400 feet below present high stand. The exposed
surface of the upper Pleistocene soil unit (Beaumont Formation) was subjected to subaerial weathering
processes for thousands of years during the low sea level cycle. Sea level data indicate the rising Gulf
waters inundated the Pleistocene horizon in Block 755, Mustang Island Area approximately 11,000 to
12,000 years BP. Prehistoric archaeological sites could not have been preserved within the upper 40 feet of
Holocene deposits resolved in the subbottom profiles.
There were no landforms identified within the survey area that could be considered as high probability
areas for prehistoric occupations.

Side Scan Sonar and Magnetometer Analysis
The sonar was run at 300-600 kHz; data quality was good (Figure No. 4, Map 3). In general, the side
scan sonar images exhibit primarily moderate reflectivity, which indicate medium textured seafloor
sediments. The seafloor was devoid of any significant naturally occurring bathymetric features.
Numerous trawl drag marks and other seafloor scars were noted on the data (Figure No. 4, Map 3).
There are a total of four (4) side scan sonar contacts noted within the survey area.
Sonar Contact No. 1 measures 56.3 feet in length, 5.6 feet in width, with a height of 3 feet above the
surrounding seafloor. A small area of disturbed seafloor surrounds this sonar contact. Sonar Contact No.
1 is located in the southern portion of the survey area next to the location of the abandoned âAâ well site
location. This contact is believed to represent modern, construction debris associated with the âAâ well
site. Prominent drag scars as wide as 150 feet across lead from this well site location and exit the survey
area in the northeast corner. These scars can be seen on the Side Scan Sonar Mosaic Map (Map 3).
Sonar Contact No. 2 is located in the central portion of the survey area along the drag scar associated
with the âAâ well site location. This contact measures 3 feet in length, 0.9 feet in width, with no
measurable height above the surrounding seafloor. This sonar contact is rectangular in shape and is
interpreted as modern debris.

Report No. 2413-1071

Sonar Contact No. 3 is located in the northeastern portion of the survey area. This contact measures 19
feet in length, 1 foot in width, with no measurable height above the surrounding seafloor. This sonar
contact is linear in shape and is interpreted as modern debris.
Sonar Contact No. 4 is also located in the northeastern portion of the survey area. This contact
measures 4.4 feet in length, 0.8 feet in width, with no measurable height above the surrounding seafloor.
This sonar contact is linear in shape and is interpreted as modern debris.
There are no unidentified magnetic anomalies associated with these four (4) sonar contacts. All sonar
contacts noted within the survey area are interpreted as debris targets associated with former
construction, fishing, or shipping activities.
The contacts are listed and described, with X-Y coordinates and a digital reproduction in the table in
Appendix A. The X-Y coordinates for the contacts, with their corresponding index numbers, are also
included in a table on Map 2, where the targets are plotted.
None of the sonar contacts noted within the survey area are deemed archaeologically significant. No
unusual depressions, scours, sediment changes, or unidentified seafloor targets were observed that
could represent unidentified shipwreck remains.
A total of five hundred and ninety-seven (597) mappable reef objects (cement pyramids and cement
culverts) were noted within the central and northwestern portions of the survey area (Figure No. 4). All
reef objects have been plotted on Map 2, their positions corrected for sensor setback. There were no reef
objects noted outside of the proposed reef boundary. The Texas Department of Wildlife and Fisheries
reported prior deposition of 457 cement pyramid structures and 96 cement culvert structures. These
structures were deployed to establish a marine habitat for artificial reef growth. The discrepancy between
the overall number reported and the number mapped can be attributed to resolution of the side scan
sonar sensor and the heave/roll of the sensor. Total count is based on best attempt to distinguish
individual reef objects when located in clusters.
The magnetometer recorded data on 100-gamma and 1,000-gamma scales at a one-half second sample
rate (Figure No. 6). The sensor was towed within 20 feet of the seafloor on a majority of the survey area.
Due to the cement pyramids and culverts placed in the central and northwestern portions of the survey
area, the magnetometer sensor was raised to avoid entanglement Sensor depths below sea level were
annotated in the logs at the beginning and end of each track line (Appendix D).
The background noise was generally one to two gammas peak to peak. A total of thirty-four (34)
unidentified magnetic anomalies were detected from the geophysical data within the survey area and
range in amplitude from 12 to 99 gammas and durations from 186 to 613 feet (Figure No. 7). All
magnetic anomalies (identified and unidentified) have been listed on the Magnetic Anomaly Table
included in Appendix A. All unidentified anomalies have been plotted on the Archaeological, Bathymetry,
and Hazard Map and the Magnetic Contour Map, their positions corrected for sensor setback.
All unidentified magnetic anomalies are located within the areas of the cement pyramids and culverts.
Due to the amount of ferrous material contained within the pyramids/culverts, individual magnetic
anomalies were difficult to distinguish within an âIncreased Magnetic Noise Area.â This area has been
outlined on Map 2. Within this area, the magnetometer sensor was also raised higher than 20 feet above
the seafloor to avoid collision and entanglement.
There were no unidentified magnetic anomalies noted outside of the area containing the cement
pyramids/culverts.

Report No. 2413-1071

An assessment of the distributions of the unidentified anomalies indicates that all appear to be associated
with existing cement pyramids or culverts. None of the anomalies cluster or evidence signatures
suggestive of buried shipwreck remains.
A magnetic contour map was created depicting isolines at a 10-gamma contour interval illustrating the
complexity and intensity of the recorded magnetic anomalies (Map 4). The average magnetic ambient
field (gammas) for the survey area was removed from the collected magnetometer data set to establish a
positive/negative anomaly relationship. Positive gamma signatures are depicted as red isolines, while
negative gamma signatures are depicted as blue isolines.

VI. Conclusions and Recommendations
The evaluation of the high-resolution geophysical survey data from a survey conducted within Block 775,
Mustang Island Area, offshore Texas indicates that there were no landforms identified within the survey
area that could be considered as high probability areas for prehistoric occupations.
There were no unusual depressions, scours, sediment changes, unidentified magnetic anomalies or
unidentified seafloor targets observed within the survey area that could represent unidentified shipwreck
remains.
It is possible that historic shipwreck materials may not be detected by the geophysical instruments or may
be obscured by modern debris. If wooden planking or other cultural materials that could represent
shipwreck remains are encountered, cease operations and contact a representative from the Texas
Historical Commission to provide further guidance.

USER'S GUIDE TO MAGNETIC ANOMALY TABLE
GLOSSARY OF TERMS:
â¢

Anomaly No. - The number that correlates to a particular magnetic anomaly.

â¢

Line No. - The survey trackline followed by the survey vessel. On occasion a rerun of
the Line may have been performed. All Lines will be posted on the Hazard map unless
they would clutter hazard's presentation. Where matching anomalies are recorded, the
larger gamma reading will be posted.

â¢

Recorded Position - The Shot Point where the anomaly can be found on the original
records. No towing setback is applied.

â¢

Corrected Position - The Shot Point where the anomaly can be found on the Hazard
Map. Setback from the navigation antenna is applied.

â¢

Amplitude in Gammas - Maximum magnetic field deflection from crest to trough of an
anomaly.

â¢

Width in Feet - The distance from start of magnetic field deviation to end.

â¢

Monopole/Dipole/Complex - Description of anomaly signature. Either it has a positive
or negative field change (Monopole), the signature changes from positive to negative
across a single anomaly (Dipole), or the signature changes from positive to negative
several times across a single anomaly (Complex).

â¢

Sensor Height Off Bottom - Determined with depth sensor attached near the
magnetometer sensor. This elevation can be used on the Breiner nomogram as
minimum distance from ferrous source.

â¢

Description - Source of anomaly, i.e., pipeline or structure. If source cannot be
identified, the anomaly is quoted as DEBRIS. Broad signatures with low gamma
amplitudes are quoted as GEOLOGIC SOURCE if they correlate to near-surface
structural features.

STARFIX.HP
Starfix.HP High Precision
Starfix.HP (High Precision) is a dual frequency GPS carrier phase based service which offers sub-decimetre horizontal position accuracies (95%) at
distances up to 500km and 10cm horizontal position accuracies up to 1000km from the closest reference station. Vertical accuracies are 15cm and
30 cm, respectively. Fugro operates an extensive network of over 100 high accuracy dual frequency reference stations world-wide. The network
has 100% redundancy in both infrastructure and control.

Key Features:
Â
Â
Â
Â
Â
Â

Capable of 10cm (95%) accuracy in horizontal and 15cm (95%) in
vertical domain.
HDOP < 2.5 (Within coverage areas)
Dual delivery satellite beams â high power and low power
Extensive QC monitoring in line with UKOOA standards
Real-time system performance information available on-line
Compatible with existing SkyFix hardware

Starfix.HP Technology
GPS user accuracy is limited by how well the different error sources are known at the user location.
Standard DGPS techniques typically lump all errors (orbit, ionosphere, troposphere, clock, multi-path)
into a single range (Prc) and range rate (Rrc) term. As long as the reference and user GPS receiver
sees the same errors then the user position will be accurate to some level. As the distance between the
user and reference station increases, the effects of error de-correlation become significant, increasing
the position error observed by the user. As the solar activity has increased the effect of error decorrelation in the ionosphere is predominant compared to the other error sources.
By using dual frequency GPS receivers we can measure the true ionosphere at the reference and user
locations, substantially eliminating this error. Using these iono-free measurements with information
contained in the receiver carrier phase data, we are able to create wide area positioning results of
unmatched accuracy and performance.
Starfix.HP uses proprietary algorithms to provide 10cm level accurate positioning solutions.

HP Performance
Improved performance of decimetre level phase based systems is seen in the
difference between errors in Easting and Northing with HP (top) and VBS (bottom).
Regular movement in HP northing is reflected in HP Northing as vessel was at
harbour.

Starfix Subscription
In 2005 the Starfix network introduced Starfix subscription, it is now possible to
subscribe to the Starfix network only when required, providing a pay-for-use system
that is enabled and disabled without the need to remove hardware.

HP vs. VBS

HP Position Calculation
Starfix.HP is one of Fugroâs high precision GNSS services. GNSS stands for
Global Navigation Satellite System, which includes GPS, the Russian Glonass and
European Galileo systems. HP is currently based on GPS only, but Glonass and
Galileo are in the process of being implemented.
Starfix.HP is based on differential techniques, using a network of reference
stations to reduce or eliminate biases due to the troposphere, satellites orbits and
clocks. Ionospheric effects are eliminated by forming linear combinations of L1 and
L2 observations (the ionospheric effects are frequency-dependent). Data from the
reference stations is transmitted to mobile users using geostationary
(communication) satellites, like Easat, Amsat, etc. Fugroâs Starfix Satellite uplink
yard. Fugroâs global network of reference stations (together with the areas covered
by the geostationary satellites), provide the reference station data to users. Some
stations are used for services other than HP, such as standard DGPS, which
provide accuracies at the metre level.
Today precise (10-20 cm standard deviation) orbits and clocks are available in
real-time. For long baselines or when large height differences are involved,
tropospheric effects have to be estimated, whereas ionospheric effects are
eliminated, not by using a differential set-up, but by forming linear combinations
of observations. Another reason for applying differential techniques is that
convergence time can be reduced, since it allows for the resolution of the
integer ambiguities; however, this will work only for relatively short baselines.
The State Space corrections consist of the differences between precise
satellite positions and clock offsets, and those computed using the parameters,
transmitted by the satellites in their navigation messages. Starfix.HP
corrections are added to the parameters computed using the broadcast
navigation messages, resulting in precise satellite positions and clock offsets.

In the picture opposite an example of a convergence period for a
moving receiver is shown (HP).
The initial precision is comparable to the one obtained from
absolute positioning using code observations only. After a while,
the precision improves, due to the increased weight of the carrier
observations. RTK (Real-Time Kinematic) techniques take
advantage of the integer nature of the carrier ambiguities, but can
be applied to relatively short baselines only.
For HP, the baselines are in general too long to resolve the integer
ambiguities. As a result, the convergence takes a long time.
In general, a 45-60 minutes convergence period is acceptable for
HP users. However, sometimes lock to the GNSS signalâs is lost
due to obstructions or interference. In those cases, users donât
like to wait another hour before to reach decimetre accuracy.
Fugro has developed and implemented a technique for fast reconvergence, which makes it possible to bridge gaps in GNSS
signal reception of up to 60-90 seconds. Once the satellite
signals are re-acquired after a gap, positioning will almost
instantaneously revert to the high precisions available before the
gap.
Note: HP will start a convergence after each GPS interruption.

SkyFix-XP (Decimetric Differential GPS)
SkyFix-XP is a GPS positioning system that is based on clock and orbit corrections supplied by NASAâs Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). SkyFixXP is a Precise Point Positioning (PPP) technology, which distinguishes itself from the traditional differential approach as satellite errors are not
lumped together but estimated per source, per satellite; it is also known as a âState Space solutionâ. The GPS clock and orbit corrections are
computed independently, free of ionospheric and tropospheric effects.

Capable of 10cm accuracy in horizontal and 20cm in vertical domain.
Truly global coverage with no range restrictions from stations
Dual delivery satellite beams â high power and low power
Extensive QC monitoring in line with UKOOA standards
Real-time system performance information available on-line
Compatible with existing SkyFix hardware
Truly independent of Starfix systems

SkyFix-XP Technology
Traditional Differential GPS services use the fixed location of a single reference station to measure the
ranges to all GPS satellites in view. These measurements are then compared to the computed ranges
at that location and the resulting differences in the observations are transmitted as pseudo-range
corrections. This technique introduces some inaccuracies as the distance from the reference station
grows.
SkyFix-XP removes this range limitation by using a completely new technique known as Satellite
Differential GPS (SDGPS). Orbit and clock corrections are determined for each satellite continuously
utilizing Fugroâs global network of reference stations. These corrections are then broadcast to the user
and can be used at any location, regardless if the distance to any reference station, making the system
truly global.
The orbit and clock corrections are contained in a set of proprietary RTCM messages, which can be
received using the existing SkyFix decoders. Users require dual-frequency DGPS receiver as well as
the MultiFix 5 positioning and QC software. The high accuracy is obtained by new processing
techniques within MultiFix 5 that correct, estimate and /or eliminate the common GPS error sources
(orbits, clocks, troposphere, ionosphere, multi-path and noise).
Local tropospheric and ionospheric errors are corrected at the user end by using a dual GPS frequency
receiver. Multipath and receiver noise are addressed by using carrier phase observations within the XP
calculation.

Advantages of SkyFix XP
Â
Â
Â

A single set of corrections per satellite valid independent of the geographic location.
Independence from the existing Fugro reference station network
Simplicity for the user

Direct comparisons with competing providersâ capabilities and performance show that
Fugro continues to lead in accuracy and robustness of solution.

Quality Control and Verification
SkyFix-XP data is rigorously checked for accuracy, advanced statistical testing is performed using UKOOA recommendations. SkyFix-XP utilises
MultiFix 5, Fugroâs latest version of its GPS QC software. MultiFix 5 can also be configured with a number of back-up solutions for the primary
SkyFix-XP calculation to provide optimum redundancy. This allows the system to switch automatically to an alternative DGPS solution such as
SkyFix or SkyFix Premier. These back-up processes are performance (rather than availability) based, giving the operator maximum confidence in
the system.

Standard DGPS vs. SkyFix-XP
To provide a confirmation of accuracy, Fugro has installed regional monitoring systems located at key oil and gas hot spots around the world.
These provide real-time system performance information via the Starfix website (www.skyfix.com).

System Overview
The hardware configuration for SkyFix-XP is similar is similar to that of the standard SkyFix system, it is possible to share hardware or upgrade an
existing system with the addition of a dual frequency GPS receiver and the new MultiFix 5 software.
Typical SkyFix-XP system configuration:

The additional SkyFix-XP correction messages can be received with all existing SkyFix decoders. MultiFix 5 is compatible with most leading GPS
receivers including units produced by Thales, Trimble and Novatel.

ECHOTRAC MODEL DF 3200

The Echotrac DF3200 echo sounder (including the MarkII
and MarkIII series) by ODOM Hydrographic Systems, Inc.
collects analog paper records as well as digitized depth
information for output to a data logger. Digital depth data
can be logged direct to the navigation computer along with
date, time, and position for later post processing and
mapping. The system can be deployed on a small
workboat or inflatable, and includes a recording unit with
built in digitizer and transceiver, and a side mounted
transducer. The unit utilizes a combination of dynamic
gating and velocity fit to track the true bottom through
advanced microprocessor technology, solving the normal
problems associated with conventional depth sounders.
For example, if the "fixed gate" mode is activated, signal
digitizing can be restricted to a user-defined range,
rejecting unwanted returns during bar-check calibrations.
The acoustic pulse is generated with the Model OHS
200-24/9-19 dual frequency transducer, which operates
with a beam width of 9Â° at 200 kHz and 19Â° at 24 kHz.
The shipborn transceiver automatically adjusts power
output in proportion to the return signal yielding a clear,
unambiguous record in shallow as well as deep water.
The self-adjusting power varies from 1 to 225 watts at
200 kHz or 1 to 500 watts at 24 kHz. Return signals are
optimized by Time Varie d Gain and Automatic Gain
Control.
A thermal paper recording is printed in real-time where
automated scale changes prevent the bottom from
"running" off the chart. Scale widths are selectable in
either meters, 2 to 1,000, or feet, 10 to 3,000; however,
routine operating scales are 10 to 100 feet. Key system
parameters, i.e., velocity of sound, draft, and time, are
input from the recorder's front panel. A tide correction
may be introduced without altering the analog record in
any way. A line is added to the chart to indicate where
the bottom would be if corrected for water level.

GEOACOUSTICS GEOPULSE PINGER PROFILER
DESCRIPTION
The GeoAcoustics GeoPulse Subbottom Profiling System incorporates a variable frequency transducer array, which
consists of four transducers mounted on a plate at the end of an over-the-side gimbaled staff (Model 132) or the plate is
installed within a tow body (Model 136). Survey vessels owned and operated by FGSI are equipped with a transducer
array (Model 132) which is raised and lowered on an extending ram through the hull, amidships. The transducer array of
each system can be operated in:
â¢

"combined" mode where all four elements are driven by O.R.E. Model 140 10 kilowatt, variable frequency
Transceiver for maximum power;

â¢

"separate" mode with two elements driven by the transceiver and two used for listening (useful when a
wider beam width is desirable).

Records are obtained by first transmitting pulses of acoustic energy into the water column. Reflecting pulses from the
seafloor and substrata are received by the same transducer array used for transmission. Controlling beam widths of 55Â°
(3.5 kHz) to 30Â° (7.0 kHz) permit the operator to trade off between penetration and resolution while observing real-time
recordings. Other features include range gating, which allows scale changes to enhance structure details, and Time
Varying Gain, which triggers as the first bottom echo returns to optimize penetration without masking deeper reflections.
The Model 5210A Receiver combines the traditional compliment of filters, amplifiers, swell filter, TVG, and AGC
components. With a maximum gain of 100 dB, the 5210A allows an operator to process signals from 20 Hz to 15 kHz,
insuring compatibility with various seismic sources. A principal component of the Model 5210A is the provision of an
optical command key to the power supply. Requiring a key pulse from the graphic recorder, the key circuitry allows the
operator to manipulate the rate at which the power supply is triggered.
An integral part of the GeoPulse system is a built in "swell" filter. This adds the ability to compensate for vertical
displacement of both the source and the receiving array, which result from wave and swell action.
APPLICATIONS
The GeoPulse Model 5430A Transmitter is designed to operate with the GeoPulse Model 5210A Receiver to function as
a transceiver in a GeoPulse âpingerâ profiling system. It provides a powerful transmitted pulse at an operated selected
variable frequency, with an adjustable bandwidth, time varying gain receiver, to form a multi-purpose system applicable
to bathymetric surveys and/or subbottom profiling. The 3.5 kHz frequency in conjunction with the 10 kilowatt power
output generally achieves 20 to 100 milliseconds, or approximately 50 to 250 feet, of bottom penetration, detailing the
near-surface strata and density layers. The two-way travel time of the acoustic signal, from firing to receiving, is recorded
on an EPC Model 4800 (electrostatic) or Model 1086 (thermal) chart recorder. Travel time measurements are
subsequently applied to water column velocity information, system delays, and appropriate tow depth corrections to
calculate water depths and/or depths to subsurface events. The degree of ocean bottom penetration is variable
depending on properties of the bottom and near-surface materials, the output power, and carrier frequency. The pinger
is often used to supplement higher energy seismic systems or coring data to obtain accurate profiles of large areas.
When the pinger system is used in conjunction with the TSS Model 320 Heave Compensator, a portable system for
measuring the vertical motion of the transducer array, recorded images of the seafloor and subbottom profile are
enhanced. The obvious effect of unwanted vessel motion or varying depths of a towed transducer in deep water seafloor
mapping surveys is removed by integrating the heave compensator into the profiling system. Thus, the analog output of
the pinger profiles is effectively smoothed, permitting detailed interpretations of rugged terrain and complex subbottom
strata.
