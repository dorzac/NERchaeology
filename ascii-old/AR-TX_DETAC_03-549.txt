ABSTRACT
In March 2015 Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants (DETAC) conducted a
cultural resource management survey of the proposed recreation Kilgore TPWD TrailPhase 1 between Stone Street and Dudley Road in Kilgore, Texas. The improvements
include building a concrete trail roughly following the east bank of Bighead Creek.
Signage and a rest area are planned along the route. The cultural resources survey
included a visual inspection of bare areas and shovel testing along the route under Texas
Antiquities Permit #7204. All of the shovel tests were negative and no cultural features
were observed. No artifacts were collected. No further investigations are recommended
however, if any cultural material is recovered during construction, than excavation should
stop and a qualified archaeologist contacted to evaluate the impact. DETAC is requesting
concurrence with the determination of “no effect” to NRHP eligible properties for the
trail route.

INTRODUCTION
In March 2015, Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultant (DETAC) conducted a cultural
resources survey of a proposed Kilgore TPWD Trail-Phase I between Stone Street and Dudley
Road in Gregg County, Texas for the City of Kilgore (Figure 1).

The cultural resource

management survey was requested by the Texas Historical Commission under the Texas
Antiquities Code because the trail will be administered by the City of Kilgore and funding was
provided by Texas Parks and Wildlife (TPWD). Texas Antiquities Permit #7204 was obtained and
all terms of the permit were carried out pursuant the Texas Antiquities Code. The report was
prepared following the short report format outlined by the Council of Texas Archaeologist (CTA)
(2005a) with modifications requested by the THC (Martin 1999).
The purpose of this survey was to locate, describe and record any cultural resources within
the project area boundaries. The proposed trail route was visual examined and shovel tests were
excavated in areas with no surface water. No cultural resources were found during the surface
inspection shovel testing of the project area; therefore, no artifacts were curated.
DEFINITION OF THE STUDY AREA
The proposed development includes a 3 meter (m) (10 foot (ft)) wide concrete trail roughly
2.2 kilometers (km) (1.4 miles (mi)) long with signage and the possibility of a rest area. Total
project area is approximately 0.7 hectares (ha) (1.6 acres (ac)). The northern trail head is at the
intersction of Stone and Spring Streets. It extends southward through Meadowbrook Park crossing
Houston Street. The southern trail head is at Dudley Road. The trail route was marked with
flagging tape. Topographically, the project area is limited to the Bighead Creek floodplain.
Soils are exclusively Mantachie loam, frequently flooded, with an A-horizon of fine
sandy loam 30 cm (12 in) deep over a weak B-horizon of loam which contains more
redoximorphic features and gley colors with depth (NRCS 2015).

PREVIOS INVESTIGATIONS AND CULTURAL HISTORY
Overall, Gregg County has been part of broad studies and investigated in both larger
examinations and numerous small surveys. The closest large-scale investigations were conducted
in nearby Rusk, Panola, and Harrison Counties. These investigations were conducted primarily
for the several strip mines under the Environmental Protection Agency and Railroad
Commission (Nash 1994; Sherman 2001). Small-scale surveys were conducted for several
pipelines and road improvements throughout the area as well (Drake 2000; Perttula 2000).
In addition to the fieldwork referenced above, several documents have added
significantly to available information on the archaeological record in this region. The documents
of primary importance are D.A. Story's (1990) and J.A. Guy's (1990) discussions of the Gulf
Coastal Plain. More recently, Perttula (2004:370-407) describes the Caddoan archaeology of
northeast Texas which encompasses the area between the Red River in the north, the Trinity
River in the west and the Angelina River in the south
The occupation of the area ranges from the Paleoindian (ca. pre-7000 B.C.) to Archaic
foraging cultures (ca. 7000-200 B.C.), Early Ceramic (Woodland) (ca. 200 B.C. - A.D. 800), the
sedentary Caddoan occupation (A.D. 800 - 1680), and ends in the historic Euro American
settlement. The Paleo-Indian period (ca. 10,000-7000 B.C.) is characterized by small, mobile
bands of hunters and gatherers that consumed a variety of native plants and animals (Story
1990). The Archaic (7000-200 B.C.) refers to hunter-gatherers who implemented more
regionally specialized approaches toward exploiting their environment (Story 1990). The Early
Ceramic (200 B.C.-A.D. 800) stage, also referred to as the Woodland period, represents an
increasing utilization of the environment by local groups to include a greater reliance on
cultigens, prolonged occupations at specific locales indicating an increasingly sedentary
lifestyle, and the emergence of social and ritual ceremonies (Story 1990). The prehistory of
northeast Texas in the Late Prehistoric period essentially concerns the Caddoan culture (A.D.
800-1600). This culture is an indigenous development strongly influenced by the Mississippian
tradition of the Lower Mississippi Valley (Story 1990). Larger aggregates of people became
sedentary and constructed villages with public ceremonial areas and cemeteries found in
association with large mounds. A stratified social structure developed, corresponding to the
chiefdom level as first defined by Service (1962, 1975). Extensive commercial networks were
also established. The Historic period (1680-present) describes both the history behind the current
3

cultural setting of the area and marks a transition from the native populations domination of the
area, to the American immigrants establishment of farms, towns, and counties. Although the
area was populated by farmers and plantations, Kilgore was not founded until 1872 when a
railroad town was established on land sold to the International-Great Northern Railroad. The
town was prosperous until the Great Depression and the collapse of the Cotton market. The
population was less than 500 in 1929 but exploded to 12,000 by 1936. Large oil companies
purchased smaller operations and independent drillers by the beginning of World War II
effectively ending the boom. Today, the timber and oil industries play a prominent role in the
area’s commercial enterprises (Long 2010).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
The investigations were performed in compliance with the Texas Antiquities Code
following survey standards described by the Texas Historic Commission (2015) and report
guidelines set forth by the CTA (2005b). All fieldwork and reporting comply with the ethics
standards of the Texas Archaeological Society and the Register of Professional Archaeologists. No
State Antiquities Landmarks will be affected by the proposed construction.
Before initiating fieldwork, DETAC conducted a records and literature review using the
Texas Archaeological Site Atlas (THC 2015).

The atlas contains an updated database with

published and unpublished data regarding cultural resource surveys, location maps, and cultural
resources records In addition, these records show State Archaeological Landmarks (SAL) and
NRHP eligibility of previously recorded sites.
DETAC conducted an intensive pedestrian survey of the project area. To locate sites, the
pedestrian survey relied on shovel testing and visual examination.

Shovel testing included

excavating an area approximately 30 cm in diameter in 10 cm (4 inch) levels down to the clay
substrate or 80 cm (32 inches). The excavated matrix was screened through a 0.635 cm (0.25
inch) wire mesh screen. Shovel tests were excavated in areas which were not covered in water
from recent rain. The depth of each shovel test was recorded and notes about the soil type and
color were made.

Visual examination of the exposed subsurface was a continuous effort

between shovel tests. Exposed subsurfaces included areas stripped of leaf litter by flowing water,
over turned trees, and ant disturbances. Surface inspection photographs and shovel test locations
were recorded with Ashtech GPS units with sub-meter post-processing accuracy. Notes were made
about soil color, texture, and shovel test depth.

RESULTS
The literature search and records review of the Texas Archaeological Site Atlas (2015)
revealed three surveys within 1.6 km (1 mi) of the project area. Initially, DETAC surveyed an
expansion and pipeline for a sewage treatment plant 1.0 km (0.6 mi) north of the project area
(Galan 2005) and conducted a surveyed the Meadowbrook Park area for a new trail and playground
equipment (Galan 2010). No sites were documented in either investigation; however, both were in
highly disturbed areas or in the Bighead creek floodplain. In 2010 Sphere 3 conducted a survey for
new school campus roughly 1.6 km (1.0 mi) south of the current project area (Tiemann 2010). This
survey recorded five historic sites with scattered lithic artifacts (41RK665, 41RK666, 41RK667,
41RK669) and one Late prehistoric lithic and ceramic artifact scatter (41RK668). Site 41RK668
was recorded on a sandy terrace overlooking the Bighead Creek floodplain.
In addition to these cultural resource management surveys, advocational archaeologists
recorded site 41RK80 as a Woodland-Caddo occupation on a low terrace roughly 1.3 km (0.8 mi)
south of the current project area. There are also 14 historical markers in downtown Kilgore
between 1.0 and 2.1 km (0.6 and 1.3 mi) commemorating the oil boom and the growth of Kilgore
to include several churches and public buildings.
The previous investigations found archaeological sites on elevated sandy landforms in or
near the Bighead Creek floodplain. Given this information, the current investigations focused on
shovel testing the project area to explore the possibility of sites in the floodplain along the proposed
trail. The proposed trail route is divided into three segments: Stone Street to Meadowbrook Park,
Meadowbrook Park, and Meadowbrook Park to Dudley Road.

Stone St to Meadowbrook Park
The northern trail head is on the shoulder of an upland ridge at the junction of Spring
and Stone Streets. The trail descends quickly to the towslope of the landform then turns south
following the landform along the edge of the Bighead Creek floodplain for roughly 915 m (3,002
ft). Vegetation is mixed hardwood forest with a moderate understory of various bushes and
vines. Ground cover is limited to deadfall and leaf litter. Bighead Creek is in a shallow channel
less than one meter (3 ft) deep (Figure 2). Sediments and flotsam from recent flooding were
present across the

loam on the backslopes and Mantachie loam in the floodplain.
Shovel tests 1 and 2 on the upland ridge shoulder near the northern trail head found
mottled and gravelly sandy loam soils (Figure 3). No tests were excavated on the steep slope.
Two rectangular pits were observed on the toeslope. The soil series designation as urban land,
level area on the ridge shoulder, and the presence of the pits attest to the modern disturbance of
the landform. The visual examination and shovel testing effort continued southward along the
centerline to Meadowbrook Park. Tests were excavated along the flagged centerline on elevated
landforms between areas with standing water. Shovel tests 3 through 7 found brown gravelly
fine sandy loam on the toeslope with silt loam or clay loam in the floodplain. No cultural
features or artifacts were found except for the two pits near the north end of the trail.

Meadowbrook Park
Meadowbrook Park occupies the width of the Bighead creek floodplain. The floodplain
is level with grass ground cover, scattered mature hardwood trees and park features (trails,
playgrounds, soccer and freebee golf goals, etc.). The proposed trail will parallel the east bank
of the creek channel for roughly 577 m (1,893 ft). The park was the subject of an archaeological
survey by DETAC in July 2010. The 2010 survey included 17 tests within 20 m (66 ft) of the
proposed trail route (Figure 3). These tests found reddish brown silty loam and silty clay loam.
For the current project, Shovel Test 8 was excavated on a low rise near the creek and within 10
m (33 ft) of a 2010 test. No cultural features or artifacts were found in the 2010 survey or in the
current investigations.

Meadowbrook Park to Dudley Road
The proposed trail will be between a pasture and a berm between Meadowbrook Park and
the southern trail head on Dudley Road. The pasture is open grass floodplain with a drainage
ditch bisecting the pasture from south to north. The berm is roughly 3 m (10 ft) high, wooded
with mixed hardwood trees and a dense understory of bushes and vines. The berm parallels the
creek channel; it was not obvious if the material for the berm was dredged from the creek or
pushed into place from the pasture. There are two alternatives to the southern trial head; one on

preferred alternative is on the west side of the creek which will require a bridge across the creek
roughly 70 m (230 ft) north of Dudley Road.
Shovel testing along the trail route focused on higher topographic features. A total of
eight tests (ST 9 to 16) were excavated along the trail. ST 9 through 14 were excavated in brown
silt loam while ST 15 and 16 were excavated in recent sandy loam alluvial deposits. No cultural
features beyond the berm and drainage ditch were observed. No artifacts were found in the
shovel testing effort.
SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The proposed trail will extend 2.2 km (1.4 miles) from Stone Street south to
Meadowbrook Park, and continue to Dudley Road. Rest areas and trail sign locations were not
determined, but these will be immediately adjacent to the trail. The proposed trail will be
completely within the Bighead Creek floodplain. Texas Antiquities Permit #7204 was obtained
by DETAC for the cultural resources survey of the proposed trail.
A total of 16 shovel tests were excavated along the new right-of-way paralleling Bighead
Creek. An additional 17 shovel tests were excavated within 20 m (66 ft) of the trail during a
previous survey for Meadowbrook Park in July 2010. Therefore, a combined total of 33 tests
were excavated along the proposed trail route. No artifacts were found in the shovel tests or in
the visual examination. No artifacts were curated. Shovel testing found soils in low-lying areas
were still saturated from recent rain while soils on elevated landforms were drier.
In conclusion, the shovel testing and surface inspection did not recover cultural material.
Soils were generally silt and clay loam.

Based on the shovel test results and the visual

examination, there is little chance of encountering undiscovered cultural resources along the trail
route. DETAC is requesting a concurrence with the determination of “no effect” to NRHP
eligible properties for the proposed trail route.
