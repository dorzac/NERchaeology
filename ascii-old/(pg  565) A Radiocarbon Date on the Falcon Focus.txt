A RADIOCARBON DATE ON THE
FALCON FOCUS
Just as this bulletin was going to press, word was received from the Radiocarbon Laboratory of the University
of Michigan that an age determination had been made on
charcoal from an excavation made just above Falc6n Dam
in 1â€™951. This excavation was conducted in Site 78B9-4 by
Donald D. Hartle, then field archeologist for the River Basin
Surveys, Smithsonian Institution, with headquarters in Austin under Robert L. Stephenson. The occupation zone was
buried about 11 feet under the top of the Rosita Terrace
(see pp. 136-141 of this volume). The Rosita Terrace in this
vicinity rises about 44 feet above the normal level of the
Rio Grande and is the middle terrace in the series of three
post-glacial terraces found all along the lower Rio Grande
valley.
The 11 feet of overburden was removed by bulldozer
and the occupation zone excavated by trowel (see Hartle
and Stephenson, "Archeological Excavations at the Falc6n
Reservoir, Starr County, Texas", a mimeographed report of
the Smithsonian Institution, 1951). The calculated age of
this charcoal is 4650 plus or minus 300 years or about 2700
B.C. This date applies to the cycle of valley filling represented by the Rosita Terrace, which continued to rise for at
least 11 feet above the occupation zone before a cycle of
valley erosion began. The associated artifacts are typical of
Falc6n Focus, and the date should fall somewhere in the
middle of the total time span of this focus, for its artifacts
are also found in the higher and oldet- Zapata Terrace, and
on a lower and younger terrace of more recent date about 25
feet high. A preliminary test pit was dug in this site by
Jack T. Hughes and assistants in 1950.
