ABSTRACT
On July 18-21, August 4, 2006, and February 7-9, 12-17, 19-21, 2007, Moore Archeological
Consulting, Inc., conducted a cultural resource survey and testing investigation of an
approximately three acre Harris County, Precinct 2, Burnet Park property in east Harris County,
Texas. The park is the site of the historic David G. Burnet farmstead (41HR407). The objectives
of the investigation were to locate and identify cultural materials associated with the historic site
and within the proposed impact area, and to prepare management recommendations regarding any
identified resources. Prior to the conduct of fieldwork, consultation with the Archeology
Division of the Texas Historical Commission (THC) determined that due to the nature of the site
and the results of previous investigations, the current of investigations should include limited
testing activities in addition to survey. The testing-level work was to consist of backhoe stripping
and controlled manual excavation. This work would be focused on an area of high artifact
densities and a known historic feature in a portion of the park due to be heavily impacted by
planned construction. The investigations were conducted at the request of Clark Condon
Associates, for Harris County, Precinct 2, under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 4187.
An intensive pedestrian field survey of the project area was conducted, and included both surface
and subsurface (shovel test, backhoe scraping) examination (Figure 2; see Appendix 1 for
details). A total of 30 shovel tests were excavated, and a 14 x 12 meter area was mechanically
scraped to a depth of 75 cm in order to relocate and define a subsurface feature (Feature 1, Figure
3) identified in a previous survey (Carlson 1998). Feature investigations were conducted using a
1.3 x 1.5 m hand excavation unit that reached a total depth of 170 cm.
The investigations revealed that the cultural deposits that blanket the eastern third of the park
represent disturbed and mixed demolition debris from site occupation dating to the mid- to late19th century, the period when the farmstead was owned by David G. Burnet. No evidence of
intact surface features or constructions was identified. In Area 2, a 168 m2 area was mechanically
scraped, revealing a single subsurface feature. Excavations determined that Feature 1 represents
a privy pit that appears to be associated with this same period of occupation. The base of the
privy contains intact deposits which were sealed by a yellowish clayey matrix within a short time
after disuse. Based on these findings, it is recommended that no additional archeological work is
necessary, and that proposed construction be allowed to proceed within each of the improvement
areas. In Area 2, the location of Feature 1 and the planned interpretive center, construction plans
call for a reconstruction of the Burnet house. The planned subsurface impact near Feature 1 will
be limited to 48 house foundation piers. These will be drilled concrete piers that will measure 2 ft
in diameter, and will penetrate to a depth of 10 ft below the existing natural grade. The piers will
be placed at intervals of 8 ft. As Feature 1 measures 6 x 8 ft, it will most likely be impacted by
only a single pier. The cultural materials recovered from the privy by the 1997 backhoe trench
and the current test excavation comprise a highly representative sample of the privy contents and
construction, and thus further excavation of the feature is not justified at this time. Additionally,
as a result of the construction, the remaining portion of the privy will be protected from
disturbance and its contents preserved for possible future investigations. In the future, if the
building shielding Feature 1 is demolished and new impacts to the feature planned, additional
investigations of the feature should be conducted. After consultation with the THC, it was
determined that selected groups of artifacts would be curated at TARL.
In the event that archeological deposits or features should be encountered during
construction, work should cease in the immediate vicinity and the Archeology Division of the
Texas Historical Commission contacted for further consultation

INTRODUCTION
historical and educational in intent, and are
designed to commemorate and inform
visitors regarding the 19th century
occupation of the site by President of the
Republic David G. Burnet.

On July 18-21, and August 4, 2006,
Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc.,
conducted a cultural resource survey
investigation of an approximately three acre
Harris County, Precinct 2, Burnet Park
property in east Harris County, Texas. The
park is the site of the historic David G.
Burnet farmstead (41HR407).
The
objectives of the investigation were to locate
and identify cultural materials associated
with the historic site and within the
proposed impact area, and to prepare
management recommendations regarding
any identified resources.
Prior to the
conduct of fieldwork, consultation with the
Archeology Division of the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) determined that due to
the nature of the site and the results of
previous investigations, the current of
investigations should include limited testing
activities in addition to survey. The testinglevel work was to consist of backhoe
stripping, and would be focused on an area
of high artifact densities and a known
historic feature in a portion of the park due
to be heavily impacted by planned
construction. The investigations (MAC PN
06-7) were conducted at the request of Clark
Condon Associates, for Harris County,
Precinct 2, under Texas Antiquities Permit
Number 4187.

An intensive pedestrian field survey
of the project area was conducted, and
included both surface and subsurface
(shovel test) examination (Figure 2; see
Appendix 1 for details). A total of 30 shovel
tests were excavated, and a 14 x 12 meter
area was mechanically scraped to a depth of
75 cm in order to relocate and define a
subsurface feature (Feature 1, Figure 3)
identified in a previous survey (Carlson
1998).
The field investigations were
conducted by project archeologist Randy
Ferguson and field technicians Darren
Ashby and Kelly Schexnayder.
Roger
Moore served as the projectâs principal
investigator. Kelly Schexnayder conducted
the artifact analysis.
After consultation with THC, it was
determined that testing of the feature in
order to potentially identify its form,
function, and chronological history would be
conducted under the same antiquities permit.
Subsequent test excavations were carried out
on February 7-9, 12-17, and 19-21, 2007
(MAC PN 06-91). The excavations were
conducted by project archeologist Randy
Ferguson and field technicians Lauren
Falcon, Kelly Schexnayder, and Darren
Schubert, under the oversight of the
principal investigator, Roger Moore. The
artifact analysis for this phase was again
conducted
by
Kelly
Schexnayder.

The project area is depicted on the
Highlands, Texas 7.5' USGS topographic
quadrangle map (Figure 1). It consists of an
approximately three acre park area located
on the north shore of Burnet Bay, in the
historic community of Lynchburg. The
proposed improvements to the park are

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
from the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in mild
winters and relatively cool summer nights
(Wheeler
1976:2,
66).
Summer
temperatures average 92Â°F (33Â°C), while
winter temperatures average 64Â°F (18Â°C).
Annual precipitation averages 46 inches
(117 cm).

Soils and Geology
Harris County is located within the
West Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic
province (Hunt 1974). In the Texas region,
the surface topography of the plain is
characterized by relatively flat topography
that dips slightly towards the Gulf of
Mexico. Geologically, the project area lies
atop the Beaumont Formation, a surface
outcrop that extends from just east of the
Mississippi River in Louisiana, to
Kingsville, Texas (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1982).
The formation was
deposited during a series of glacial and
interglacial events during the Middle to Late
Pleistocene. Extensive riverine downcutting
and erosion of the formation occurred during
the periods of lower sea levels associated
with the Wisconsin glaciation. During the
Holocene, after sea levels rose once more,
the resulting river valleys filled with alluvial
soils, creating broad, level floodplains.

Hydrology
The property is located along the
north shore of Burnet Bay, a part of the
Galveston Bay system. Burnet Bay forms at
the confluence of the San Jacinto River and
Buffalo Bayou.
Flora and Fauna
Harris County lies within the
Austroriparian biotic province (Blair
1950:98-101). Not determined by a marked
physiographic break, the western boundary
of this province is loosely identified by the
distribution of pine and hardwood forests on
the eastern Gulf coastal plain. The county is
situated within the pine-oak subdivision of
the Austroriparian province (Tharp 1939).
Blair (1950) lists the dominant floral species
of the pine-oak forest subdivision as loblolly
pine (Pinus taeda), yellow pine (Pinus
echinata), red oak (Quercus rubra), post oak
(Quercus stellata), and blackjack oak
(Quercus marilandica). Hardwood forests
are found on lowlands within the
Austroriparian and are characterized by such
trees
as
sweetgum
(Liquidambar
styraciflua),
magnolia
(Magnolia
grandiflora), tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica), water
oak (Quercus nigra), and other species of
oaks, elms, and ashes, as well as the highly
diagnostic Spanish moss (Tillandisia
usneiodes) and palmetto (Sabal glabra).

The property is depicted on sheet 97
of the Soil Survey of Harris County, Texas
(Wheeler 1976). Two soil types have been
identified in the project area: Lake CharlesUrban land complex (Lu) in the western half
of the property, and Vamont-Urban land
complex (Vn) in the eastern half of the
property. Areas identified as Urban land
include soils that have been altered or
covered by buildings or other structures
(e.g., dwellings, office buildings, parking
lots, etc.). Lake Charles soils are described
as somewhat poorly drained with very slow
surface runoff (Wheeler 1976:18-19).
Vamont soils are described as somewhat
poorly drained with slow surface runoff
(Wheeler 1976:22). Based on the PALM
predictive model developed by Abbott
(2001), both soil types are upland clayey
ancient (pre-Holocene) alluvium with a low
potential for containing deeply buried
prehistoric sites.

Blair (1950) and Gadus and Howard
(1990) identify the following mammals as
common within the Austroriparian province:
white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus),
muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), raccoon
(Procyon lotor), coyote (Canis latrans),
opossum (Didelphis virginiana), Scalopus
aquaticus, Pipistrellus subflavus, Lasiurus

snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentinia), mud
turtle (Kinosteron spp.), river cooter
(Chrysemys concinna) and diamondback
terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin) comprise
common water turtles. Common lizards
include Anolis carolinensis, Sceloporus
undulatus, Leiolopisma laterale, Eumeces
laticeps, Cnemidophorus sexlineatus and
Ophiosaurus ventralis.
Snakes and
amphibians are also present in considerable
numbers and diversity.

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
11,000-10,000 B.C., and lasts for
approximately 4000 years. During this time,
it is proposed that populations continued
with a highly nomadic hunting tradition
brought with them from the Old World.
Traditional models emphasize the heavy
reliance that these groups placed on the
hunting of the large mammals of the
Pleistocene. Plant foods and small game
undoubtedly supplanted this diet, and may
have played a more important role than
previously thought (Black and McGraw
1985; Patterson 1995).
Artifact types
associated with this phase include various
fluted and non-fluted lanceolate projectile
points, such as Clovis and Folsom. In
general, due to a paucity of well-stratified
older sites, the Paleoindian stage remains
poorly defined in southeast Texas.

Southeast Texas Culture History
The project area is located within
the southeast Texas archaeological region
(Patterson 1995; Story et al. 1990). The
culture history of the region extends back at
least 12,000 years into the past. A number
of researchers have compiled chronological
frameworks to describe the cultural histories
of the area (Aten 1983; Ensor 1991;
Patterson 1995; Shafer et al. 1975; Story et
al. 1990). The majority of these divide
human occupation into four broad stages,
Paleoindian, Archaic/Lithic, Ceramic/Late
Prehistoric, and Historic. The stages are
based on a proposed sequence of economic
strategies as they are revealed through the
archaeological and/or historical record.
These proposed shifts in dominant lifeways
consider
cultural,
economic,
and
technological factors in order to provide a
heuristic model useful for attempting to
understand ancient and early historic
populations. While the dates assigned to the
period interfaces are based on "absolute"
dating methods, they of course represent a
generalized time range for the implied
cultural evolution. The dates provided in the
following discussion will be drawn from
Ensor (1991) and are presented in Table 1.

By 8000 B.C., the Late Wisconsin
glaciation had ended, increasing climatic
aridity and creating extensive changes in the
environment. As a result, the majority of
Pleistocene megafauna became extinct. This
required drastic changes in the dominant
subsistence strategies of the affected
populations. By 8000 B.C., the start of the
Early Archaic stage, the remaining southeast
Texas populations had adapted to the
environmental changes by shifting to a
lifeway dominated by seasonal scheduling.
This type of subsistence economy
specializes in a regionally circumscribed and
repetitive exploitation of specific floral and

The earliest period of occupation in
southeast Texas is identified as the
Paleoindian stage. Based on the earliest
securely dated appearance of populations in
the New World, this stage begins around

faunal resources. By remaining in familiar
territory, the nomadic populations were able

to better exploit the various resources
available within their local environment.

A.D. 600 (Aten 1983).

However, research has suggested
that human population densities remained
low in the area, and may have even
decreased significantly during this time
(Moore and Moore 1991). Eventually, the
stabilization of the climate by around 1000
B.C., the start of the Late Archaic, appears
to have led to increasing populations. This
rise in regional population may have been
further facilitated by the development of
long-distance
trade,
technological
innovations, and changing social relations
(Patterson 1995).

Historic Overview
European contact in the region
began in the early 16th century with the illfated NarvÃ¡ez expedition that, in 1528,
deposited Cabeza de Vaca onto the Texas
coastline, possibly on Galveston Island.
More long-term contacts resulting from
permanent European settlement did not
directly impact aboriginal lifeways in
southeast Texas until the early 18th century
(Patterson 1995).
However, European
diseases introduced by explorers and early
traders had begun to affect Native American
populations in Texas by the 16th century
(Ewers 1974). Throughout the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries, epidemic diseases,
the mission system, and the fur trade
seriously reduced, and in some cases
exterminated, the indigenous populations
residing in the region.

The final prehistoric period in
southeast Texas is marked by the emergence
of ceramics. Ceramic artifacts appear in the
archaeological record of the Galveston Bay
area by approximately A.D. 100, and by
A.D 500, had been adopted by a number of
inland populations (Pertulla et al. 1995). A
plain, sand-tempered type of ceramic
identified as Goose Creek became prevalent
during the period, although a number of
decorated varieties and tempering materials
were also present (Patterson 1995; Pertulla
et al. 1995). The appearance of Caddoan
pottery in southeast Texas around A.D.
1000-1300 has been used to suggest the
presence of extended trade networks or
migration during this time (Aten 1983). The
period has also been associated with the

Anglo-American settlement in the
Harris County area began in the early 1820s,
with a number of Mexican land grants
awarded in 1824 (Henson 1996). The
modern boundaries of the county were
established as Harrisburg County by the
Texas Congress in 1836, and it was renamed
Harris County in 1839. The presence of the
highly navigable Buffalo Bayou stimulated

economic development of the county, and of
the city of Houston in particular. The
establishment of six railroad lines in the area
prior to the Civil War further stimulated
economic prosperity, and helped lure a
steady stream of settlers to the region. By
the second decade of the 20th century, the
growing gas and oil industry was competing
with agricultural interests, and helped create
a significant boom in population.

The property continued to be
occupied into the mid-20th century, though
with little attention given to its original
owner.
However, in 1947, Burnetâs
ownership of the property was recognized,
and the tract was given to Harris County. In
1980, an approximately 100 by 100 meter
area of what is now Burnet Park was
recorded as archeological site 41HR407.

The Burnet farmstead, named
Oakland, was established around 1831 by
David G. Burnet and his wife, Hannah
(Carlson 1998). The farmstead consisted of
279 acres of land, and included a main
house, four outbuildings (detached kitchen,
storage crib, two slave houses) and several
fenced fields. From 1831 to 1836, Burnet
ran a sawmill located a short distance away,

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
Previous investigations conducted
within the general area date back to the
1950s, and have been summarized by Hoyt
and Schmidt (1996:45-47).
Surveys
conducted by members of the Houston
Archeological Society during eh mid- to
late-1950s focused on the San Jacinto River
and Galveston Bay shorelines. Sites located
during these surveys were later revisited by
McGruff and Ford (1973, 1974), and
information concerning degradation and loss
of shoreline was submitted to the Texas
Historical Commission and the Texas
Archeological Survey at the University of
Texas.

Prior
to
beginning
field
investigations,
Moore
Archeological
Consulting, Inc., performed a background
investigation of archeological and historical
literature relevant to the project area.
Literature examined for this project includes
site inventory records on file at TARL,
previous archeological investigative reports
on file at the Texas Historical Commission
(THC)
and
Moore
Archeological
Consulting, Inc. and other published
literature pertinent to the current project.
The David G. Burnet homesite was
first recorded as an archeological site by the
Baytown Historical Museum in 1980.
Personnel from the museum observed and
collected artifacts from a 100 by 200 ft area
in the southeast corner of the park.
According to the site form (TARL records),
the recovered artifacts included ceramics
(pearlware, ironstone, stoneware), patinated
bottle glass, window glass, and cut nails.
Observed artifacts included strap metal,
Rangia shells, bone, brick, and mortar. The
collected artifacts were curated at the
Baytown Historical Museum. However,
there were no subsurface investigations
conducted at that time to verify the location
and condition of potential archeological
deposits.

During the 1990s, Espey, Huston,
and Associates conducted archival research
in an effort to identify areas of potential
significance along the Houston/Galveston
Navigational Channels (Foster et al. 1993).
The search identified 103 previously
recorded sites and found evidence for over
600 potential sites, including portions of the
old townsite of Lynchburg. Also, Wagner
and Fields (1994) researched an abandoned
cemetery complex within the historic
townsite, and Wagner (1994) later
documented land-use history of the town.
Hoyt et al. (1995) refined the research of the
Foster
et
al.
(1993)
and
made
recommendations for investigations. The
study by Hoyt and Schmidt (1996) was
designed to assess the potential for
preservation of sites in Lynchburg given the
prevalence of destruction by natural factors,
such as storms and hurricanes.

In 1997, Moore Archeological
Consulting conducted an intensive survey of
the site (Carlson 1997). The investigations
were conducted under Texas Antiquities
Permit No. 1821, and included the
excavation of 27 shovel tests and five
backhoe trenches in the eastern side of the
park. A total of 493 historic artifacts were
recovered, and two historic features were
identified.

FIELD METHODS AND RESULTS:
SURVEY
The initial phase of fieldwork at site
41HR407 was conducted on July 18-21, and
August 4, 2006. It consisted of a 100%
pedestrian survey for cultural materials that
included visual examination of surface
exposures throughout the park, systematic
shovel testing of areas of planned impacts,
and the mechanical scraping of a 14 by 12
meter rectangular area to relocate a
previously identified historic feature. A
total of 260 artifacts were collected from the
excavations (Tables 2, 3).
Additional
artifacts, such as brick, shell, and metal
fragments, asphalt chunks, and pea gravel,
were counted but not collected (see
Appendix 1).

A total of 30 shovel tests (ST) were
excavated, each in 10 cm levels and
screened through Â¼â mesh (Figure 2;
Appendix 1). Each of the projectâs shovel
tests were recorded and plotted on the
project map. Tests were placed in each of
the seven areas due to be impacted by park
improvements, and at approximately 50 m
intervals along the route of the proposed
pathway around the property. A total of 114
artifacts were recovered from the shovel
tests (Table 3).
Area 1 is a half-circular area with a
radius of approximately 80 ft (ca. 24.4 m)
that is located along the southern edge of the
park. Proposed improvements within this
area include additional parking space and
pedestrian seating areas. A total of four
shovel tests (STs 8-11) were placed in this
area, and all were positive for historic
cultural materials. A total of 19 artifacts
were collected from this area (Table 3).
Artifacts were distributed from 0-30 cm
below ground surface.

The project area is depicted on the
Highlands, Texas 7.5' USGS topographic
quadrangle map (Figure 1). It consists of an
approximately three acre park area located
on the north shore of Burnet Bay, in the
historic community of Lynchburg. The
proposed improvements to the park are
historical and educational in intent, and are
designed to commemorate and inform
visitors regarding the 19th century
occupation of the site by President of the
Republic David G. Burnet.

Area 2 is the largest area, and is
slated for the deepest construction impacts
as the location of interpretive historic
buildings and picnic areas. Based on their
investigations, Carlson (1997:21) proposed
this to the most likely location of the actual
Burnet house and outbuildings. The roughly
oblong-shaped area measures approximately
160 ft (ca. 48.8 m) east-west by 100 ft (ca.
30.5 m) north-south. The tests in this area
were integrated into the previous series of
shovel tests conducted on a 10-meter grid by
MAC personnel during the 1997 survey
(Carlson 1997). A total of six new shovel
tests (STs 1-4, 6, 30) were placed in the
areaâs western half, in addition to the five
previous tests (5-7, 9-10) in the eastern half
from 1997. All of the new tests were
positive for historic cultural materials (as
were all five of those from 1997). A total of
80 artifacts were collected from this area

The park is roughly rectangular in
shape, and is bounded by Burnet Road on
the north and Hillcrest Road on the south.
The western two-thirds of the property
contains two extant softball/baseball fields,
and is covered by manicured lawns of San
Augustine and Bermuda grasses.
The
eastern third of the park contains a
playground, volleyball court, and granite
monument, and is also covered in wellmanicured lawn grasses and a light density
of pecan and bois dâarc trees. Planned
construction impacts are limited to seven
areas (Areas 1-7) within the eastern side of
the park, as well as a narrow paved
pedestrian path that will encircle the entire
property, and provide access to each of the
major park facilities.

historic cultural materials. No artifacts were
collected from this area, but uncollected
artifacts were distributed from 0-30 cm
below ground surface.

(Table 3). Artifacts were distributed from 040 cm below ground surface.
In addition, a 14 x 12 meter area
was mechanically scraped in order to
relocate a historic pit feature (Feature 1,
Figure 3) that had been discovered in 1997
(see below). A total of 156 artifacts were
collected from the scraping excavations
(Table 2).

Area 7 is the proposed location for
the main park entrance; it measures
approximately 35 ft (ca. 10.7 m) in diameter.
Two shovel tests (STs 19-20) conducted
there did not produce any cultural materials.
The soils in the upper 20-25 cm of this area
appeared to be imported fills, suggesting
previous construction here had truncated the
uppermost, culture-bearing zone.

Area 3 is a relatively small area
measuring approximately 25 ft (ca. 7.6 m) in
diameter, and is intended to be the location
of a fenced cement pad for utilities. Two
shovel tests (STs 7, 13) were conducted
within the area, both of which were positive
for historic cultural materials. A total of 3
artifacts were collected from this area (Table
3). Artifacts were distributed from 0-30 cm
below ground surface.

Finally, a total of nine shovel tests
(STs 21-29) were placed outside of the
seven construction areas, but along the
proposed route of the pedestrian walkway.
Only two of these were positive for cultural
materials (STs 28, 29). Both of the positive
tests were located near Area 2. A total of 13
artifacts were collected from this area.
Artifacts were distributed from 0-30 cm
below ground surface.

Area 4 is another relatively small
area measuring approximately 30 ft (ca. 9.1
m) in diameter. The area is currently
covered by a sand volleyball court, but is to
be the location of a circular intersection of
pathways and seating. Two shovel tests
(STs 12, 14) were placed in the area. Both
were positive for historic cultural materials.
A total of 5 artifacts were collected from this
area (Table 3). Artifacts were distributed
from 0-40 cm below ground surface.

Feature 1
Feature 1 was initially identified
within a backhoe trench during the 1997
investigations of the park (Carlson 1997).
As revealed in the trench wall, the feature
was approximately 2.5 m wide and 2.0 m
deep, and appeared to have been partially
lined with vertical wood planks (Carlson
1997:9). Feature fill consisted of three
discrete strata, and upper 20-25 cm layer of
humic topsoil, a 1.5 m thick stratum of
mottled yellowish brown sandy clay with
lime-like inclusions, and a 20-25 cm thick
underlying layer of mottled light brownish
gray and black sandy clay. Some black
mottling present in the layer was described
as possible ash or charcoal inclusions. In
addition, this lowest layer contained a
number of historic artifacts, including
fragments
of
brick,
wood,
metal
(undecorated whitewares and porcelain
sherds were also recovered from the
backhoe spoil pile, but could not be
attributed to a particular stratum). Carlson
(1997:10) suggests the feature represents a

Area 5 is an oblong area measuring
approximately 75 ft (ca. 22.9 m) north-south
by 30 ft (ca. 9.1 m) east-west. Planned
improvements to the area include the
construction of a childrenâs playground.
Two shovel tests (STs 15, 18) were placed
in the area, both were positive for historic
cultural materials.
No artifacts were
collected from this area, but uncollected
artifacts were distributed from 10-30 cm
below ground surface.
Area 6 is a third small area that
measures approximately 30 ft (ca. 9.1 m) in
diameter. The area is the planned location
of park restrooms. The two shovel tests
(STs 16-17) placed there were positive for

wood-lined cistern that may date to the early
1830s period of site occupation.
An
alternate suggestion based on the presence
of the lime inclusions, that the feature
represents an in-filled privy, was discarded
due to the location of the feature in an area
that would have been in the propertyâs front
yard.

west. The 60 cm wide backhoe trench from
1997 had almost diagonally bisected the
feature, cutting across it from the northwest
to the southeast. Once recorded, a metal
spike was placed in its northeast corner (in
order to aid in its relocation for testing), and
it was covered with plastic sheeting and
reburied.

During the current project, Feature 1
was relocated by using a backhoe to
carefully scrape off the topsoil and reveal
the feature in plan (Figures 4-7). The
excavation was conducted with a backhoe
equipped with a smooth âclean-outâ blade,
and the scraping was conducted in four
approximately 3 x 12 m wide trenches,
which were loosely used for maintaining
horizontal provenience for recovered
artifacts. For vertical control, the sediments
were carefully removed in approximately
10-20 cm thick layers to a total depth of 75
cm, where the lighter soil of the feature was
clearly revealed against the darker, natural
sediments. The distinctive soil color and
texture differences exposed both the
interfaces between the feature and the
surrounding soil matrix, as well as the
location of the original 1997 backhoe trench
(Figure 6). Once the feature was identified,
the scraping excavations were terminated,
and the feature was recorded. No other
subsurface features were identified within
the scraped area.

Artifacts Recovered from the Scraped
Area (by Kelly Schexnayder)
Material culture discovered in the
recent scraping associated with Feature 1
includes ceramics, glass, square nails,
hardware, handmade brick, and bone (Table
2). Although none of artifacts can be said to
have come from the feature itself, the
cultural zone surrounding it consisted of a
temporal period from the early to late 19th
century.
There was little if no
contamination from modern twentiethcentury activity.

The final dimension of the scraped
area measured 14 m north-south by 12 m
east-west (168 m2).
The excavation
revealed the following stratigraphy: 0-30 cm
is a very dark brown (10yr2/2) clay loam,
30-53 cm is very dark brown (10yr2/2) clay
loam with olive brown (2.5yr4/3) clay, and
53-75+ cm is a subsoil of olive brown
(2.5yr4/3) clay with mottling of olive yellow
(2.5yr6/8) clay.

Several varieties of ceramics were
recovered from the scraped area associated
with Feature 1, consisting mostly of
undecorated whitewares.
These wares
typically date from 1830-1875 (Lange and
Carlson 1985:104-105). In addition there
were decorated wares which included blue
shell edged wares, blue and brown
transferprints, and hand-painted wares.

The feature itself was roughly
oriented north-south, and was slightly
rectangular, measuring 2.72 cm along its
north edge, 2.58 cm along its south edge,
and 2.25 cm on the east, 2.30 cm on the

Some of these tablewares, i.e. the
transferprint, were typically used between
1780 and 1830 (Lange and Carlson

12

1985:104-105). Two retrofitting plate base
fragments indicated a partial makerâs mark
by Goddard, more than likely of Turner,
Goddard & Co. ca. 1867-1874 (Kovel
1986:12).
Other coarser wares were
utilitarian earthenwares (i.e. hotelware),
yellowware, and stoneware.

Artifacts recovered from Feature 1
in the 1997 survey (Carlson 1997) were of
the same temporal period as those
discovered in the recent archeological
investigation.
Those artifacts were
comprised of bone, glass, ceramic, and
various metal items (identifiable and
unidentifiable). Most of the ceramics were
undecorated whitewares but also included
fragments
of
porcelain,
lavender
transferprint, stoneware, and glazed redpaste
earthenware.
These ceramics dated
generally from the mid-nineteenth century
(Carlson 1997). A few of the metal artifacts
appeared to be hand-forged. Most of the
artifacts were concentrated at the base of the
feature and as a whole there were little if no
materials from the twentieth century.

Glassware consisted mostly of flat
glass and bottle glass. One bottle base had a
pontil scar, indicating it to be handblown.
Pontils dominated the bottom of the bottle
up to early 1800âs in America when
technological advances resulted in the snap
mold (Toulouse 1971:9).
The structural materials, such as the
square nails, hardware, and brick, were all
pre-machinery. The square nails and some
of the hardware, e.g., the chain link, were
handwrought. The soft paste and evidence
of lipping on the brick indicated it to be
handmade.

FIELD METHODS AND RESULTS:
TESTING
within the pit consisted of a yellowish
clayey termination fill that was easily
distinguishable from that of the dark, in-situ
privy contents of the lowest levels.

The second phase of fieldwork at
site was conducted on February 7-9, 12-17,
and 19-21, 2007. Work during this phase
was focused on the testing of Feature 1 by
hand excavation in order to potentially
identify
its
form,
function,
and
chronological history.

In terms of its construction, the
lower portion of the pit had been lined with
a floor of wooden planks and horizontal
wooden sideboards, a construction technique
that indicates the pit was intended to be
periodically cleaned out. The planks were
of various lengths, but each of the intact
boards measured 4 inches (ca. 10 cm) in
width and 3/4 inches (ca. 2 cm) in thickness.
The wooden floor remained extremely wellpreserved, with most of the planks
remaining in place (Figure 13). The side
walls, however, appeared to have begun to
slump inward while the pit was still open.
The side walls had been at least 27 inches
(70 cm) in height. Several of the horizontal
boards comprising the pit walls were still
affixed to the vertical posts by square nails
(Figure 14). Unlike the floor planks, which
were abutted tightly together, the side walls
were constructed with gaps of 1-3 inches.
The slumping of these side walls created a
distinct vertical stratum between the later
termination fill and the original builderâs
wall of the pit. This builderâs trench area
was identified during excavation as Area B,
while that which was clearly within the
plank walls was designated as Area A
Figures 10, 15).

The testing began with the removal
of backdirt overburden and protective plastic
sheeting that had been placed over the
feature at the end of the survey
investigations (Figures 8, 9).
A hand
excavation unit measuring 1.3 x 1.5 meters
was placed in the northwest corner of the
feature.
The unit was designed to
approximately quarter the feature, and
provide both a section view of feature
deposits on its south balk, and expose the
original pit walls along the unitâs north and
west sides. The east balk of the unit was
formed by the previously excavated (and
backfilled) backhoe trench from the 1997
investigations (Carson 1997).
A vertical datum was established at
the unitâs northwest corner, and excavations
were conducted in arbitrary 10 cm levels
down to a final depth of 170 cm. Excavated
matrix was screened through Â¼â mesh, and
all cultural materials were collected. Level
forms were filled out at the completion of
each level. Plan drawings were recorded at
the base of Levels 3 and 10 (Figures 10, 11),
and once the excavation was complete, a
profile drawing was made of the unitâs south
wall (Figure 12).
A total of 114
photographs were taken during the
excavations.

The darker deposits of the intact
privy contents were first encountered in
Level 8, but only in the pitâs northwest
corner, and along the pit walls (Figure 11,
16). Reaching a maximum thickness of 70
cm in this corner, the deposits decreased in
thickness to a mere 20 cm in the southeast
corner of the unit (i.e., near the center of the
privy). The uneven nature of the deposits,
and their lack of distinct horizontal
microstratigraphy (e.g., lenses of lime or ash
commonly found in privy fills) suggests the

Based on the investigations, Feature
1 clearly represents an abandoned and filled
privy pit. The original dimensions of the
privy vault had been approximately 6 x 8 ft
in plan, and at least 5 ft in depth (the
contemporary ground surface could not be
identified). The majority of the matrix

pearlware sherds from Levels 2 and 13.
Though more difficult to interpret, this most
likely suggests that the privy was backfilled
shortly after its abandonment, and that the
yellowish fill material came from nearby
and included materials from household
rubbish piles or from sheet midden areas.

privy may have been partially cleaned out a
short time before it was abandoned.
The privy excavations recovered a
large number of artifacts (Table 4),
including brick fragments (189), ceramic
sherds (61), shards of flat window glass (27)
and bottle glass (29), square nails (55) and
various metal artifacts (22; including a
straight razor, a padlock, pick head, shovel
blade, and fragments of a chamber lamp
[Figures 21, 22]), peach pits (3), slate
fragments (3), one wooden shoe heel, and
one fragment of a bone toothbrush
(Appendix B). In addition, there were
numerous wood fragments from the partially
decomposed planks of the privy box (228;
only pieces 3 cm or larger were collected).
Faunal remains included a number of large
mammal bone fragments (27; probable cattle
bone, no butcher marks were identified), and
nine turtle carapace fragments. Much of the
bone, including the turtle, had clearly been
burned.

Recovered materials that were
chronologically diagnostic included two
types of transferware and an intact glass
bottle. One blue transferware was recovered
from Level 14 (Figures 17, 18). The interior
face of this sherd had a portion of an image
showing Napoleon astride a horse, while its
reverse side had a makerâs mark that
represents C. J. Mason & Co. 1826-1845
(Pollen et al. 1996:57). There were also 19
purple transferware sherds recovered from
Levels 11-15. These sherds all appear to be
from the same floral design tea set.
A
makerâs mark of âR & C, Easternâ (Figure
19), on the base of one saucer indicates its
manufacture by Read & Clemenson of
Staffordshire Potteries of England, 18331835 (Godden 1964:524). A whole glass
bottle was recovered from Level 10 (Figure
20). It is a 12-sided toiletry bottle of handblown glass with an applied finish and a
hinge-mold. This make of bottle usually
dates no later than 1890, while the presence
of its pontil scar refines that date to 1860 or
earlier. Together, these diagnostic materials
indicate the site was occupied around the
middle of the 19th century, a period that
would be consistent with the residence of
the Burnet family.

The majority of the artifacts were
contained within the darker fills of the privy
pit, and the dark sediment layer between the
privy wall and termination fill. While much
of this debris is common to privy fills, other
artifact types are more often associated with
demolition debris. In two cases, pearlware
ceramic sherds could be cross-mended from
stratigraphically separate locations. Two
sherds were cross-mended between Levels
4A and 4B, suggesting that the wooden
walls had collapsed prior to privy disuse (at
least as a receptacle of household rubbish).
The second example occurred between

be conducted under the same antiquities
permit.
The feature investigation was
conducted using a 1.3 x 1.5 m hand
excavation unit that reached a total depth of
170 cm.

On July 18-21, August 4, 2006, and
February 7-9, 12-17, 19-21, 2007, Moore
Archeological Consulting, Inc., conducted a
cultural resource survey and testing
investigation of an approximately three acre
Harris County, Precinct 2, Burnet Park
property in east Harris County, Texas. The
park is the site of the historic David G.
Burnet farmstead (41HR407).
The
objectives of the investigation were to locate
and identify cultural materials associated
with the historic site and within the
proposed impact area, and to prepare
management recommendations regarding
any identified resources.
Prior to the
conduct of fieldwork, consultation with the
Archeology Division of the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) determined that due to
the nature of the site and the results of
previous investigations, the current of
investigations should include limited testing
activities in addition to survey. The testinglevel work was to consist of backhoe
stripping and controlled manual excavation.
This work would be focused on an area of
high artifact densities and a known historic
feature in a portion of the park due to be
heavily impacted by planned construction.
The investigations (MAC PN 06-7, 06-91)
were conducted at the request of Clark
Condon Associates, for Harris County,
Precinct 2, under Texas Antiquities Permit
Number 4187.

The shovel tests determined that the
distribution of historic cultural materials was
limited to the eastern end of the park, and
was present in Areas 1-6. The soils of Area
7 demonstrated extensive disturbances and
appeared to have been truncated by previous
park improvements. In the areas where
materials were present, they were confined
to the uppermost 0-40 cm. The grounds of
the park have been extensively manicured,
and no evidence of intact surface or
landscape features (e.g., house foundations,
livestock facilities, etc.) was identified. The
recovered materials represent several types
of
functional
categories,
including
architectural, personal, and subsistence.
However, the horizontal distribution of the
materials suggests the mixture of categories
commonly associated with demolition
debris, rather than intact activity areas
(house, workshops) or serial discard zones
(e.g., refuse middens, sheet middens).
The excavations at Feature 1
determined that it represents an intact
subsurface privy vault. Based on recovered
artifacts, it appears that the privy is most
likely associated with Burnetâs occupation
of the property in the mid-19th century.
Further, feature contents and stratigraphy
indicate that the privy was filled with local
soils within a short time after its disuse and
abandonment.

An intensive pedestrian field survey
of the project area was conducted, and
included both surface and subsurface
(shovel test) examination (Figure 2; see
Appendix 1 for details). A total of 30 shovel
tests were excavated, and a 14 x 12 meter
area was mechanically scraped to a depth of
75 cm in order to relocate and define a
subsurface feature (Feature 1, Figure 3)
identified in a previous survey (Carlson
1998). After consultation with THC, it was
determined that testing of this feature in

In summary, investigations at
Burnet Park have revealed that the cultural
deposits that blanket the eastern third of the
park represent disturbed and mixed
demolition debris from site occupation
dating to the mid- to late-19th century, the
period when the farmstead was owned by
David G. Burnet. No evidence of intact

The cultural materials recovered from the
privy by the 1997 backhoe trench and the
current test excavation comprise a highly
representative sample of the privy contents
and construction, and thus further
excavation of the feature is not justified at
this time. Additionally, as a result of the
construction, the remaining portion of the
privy will be protected from disturbance and
its contents preserved for possible future
investigations. In the future, if the building
shielding Feature 1 is demolished and new
impacts to the feature planned, additional
investigations of the feature should be
conducted. After consultation with the
THC, it was determined that selected groups
of artifacts would be curated at TARL.

surface features or constructions was
identified. In Area 2, a 168 m2 area was
mechanically scraped, revealing a single
subsurface feature. Excavations determined
that Feature 1 represents a privy pit that
appears to be associated with this same
period of occupation. The base of the privy
contains intact deposits which were sealed
by a yellowish clayey matrix within a short
time after disuse.
Based on these findings, it is
recommended
that
no
additional
archeological work is necessary, and that
proposed construction be allowed to proceed
within each of the improvement areas. In
Area 2, the location of Feature 1 and the
planned interpretive center, construction
plans call for a reconstruction of the Burnet
house. The planned subsurface impact near
Feature 1 will be limited to 48 house
foundation piers. These will be drilled
concrete piers that will measure 2 ft in
diameter, and will penetrate to a depth of 10
ft below the existing natural grade. The piers
will be placed at intervals of 8 ft. As
Feature 1 measures 6 x 8 ft, it will most

In the event that archeological
deposits or features should be encountered
during current construction, work should
cease in the immediate vicinity and the
Archeology Division of the Texas Historical
Commission
contacted
for
further
consultation.
