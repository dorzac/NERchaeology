A PRELIMINARY REPORT ON THE ALBERT
GEORGE SITE IN FORT BEND COUNTY
RAYMOND WALLEY

This article will deal with some of the more interesting
findings at the Albert George Site, and particularly with
a cache of bone artifacts found in probable association with
two skeletons.
The Albert George Site is one of several known to the
writer along Big Creek, a tributary of Brazos River, in
southern Fort Bend County (Fig. 9). This general locality
is on the coastal plain of Texas, about 35 to 40 miles inland
from the Brazos River mouth, 50 miles due west of Galveston, and 25 miles southwest of Houston. Before clearing,
the area was heavily wooded with such trees as elm, ash,
hackberry, ironwood, and live oak mixed with shrubs and
vines.
There was sporadic digging in the Albert George Site by
early settlers looking for gold. Many years after these
settlers had moved and the site forgotten, it was re-discovered by a hunter whose dog had scratched out a flint
knife. The hunter then dug quite a lot in the area, but as
he reported that "nothing but old Indian bones" had been
found, interest was lost until I heard the story in 1951 and
attempted to re-locate the site.
In December, 1951, the combination campsite, burial
ground, and midden was found. Three burials were dis:.
covered at that time. One was that of a female about 16
years old, semi-flexed on the right side. On each side of
the skull there was a small, pointed pendant made from
the columnella of a conch shell. These pendants are a
matched pair between 7 and 7.5 em. long, each with a small
hole at one end (Plate 36, I, J), and diameter of about 1.5
em. They are similar to a shell pendant from the Crooks
Site in east-central Louisiana.1

Texas ArcheoLogicaL Society

In 1954 a group of amateur archeologists from the Brazosport area again visited the site after it was learned that
clearing of the creek banks on both sides by bulldozer had
resulted in the trees and brush being pushed back at least
100 feet (Plate 34, A). It was impossible to find the exact
location of the previous work, but an undisturbed area approximately 40 by 20 feet was found at the highest part of
the site. At the center of this area, eight plots each 5 feet
square were laid out and numbered from I to VIII (Plate
34, B).

An east-west base line was run through the center of
this area, and four plots were staked out to the north and
to the south of the base line. The square at the southwest
corner was called plot I and those running to the east called
plots II, III, and IV. The square at the northwest corner
was plot V and those running east from it became plots VI,
VII, and VIII. Only two of these plots proved of little value.
Plot I contained two deer cannon-bone awls and what was
thought to be bison teeth. Plot V contained only deer bones,
shells, and occasional potsherds.
Each of the other plots yielded at least two, and some as
many as four, burials. It appears that in some instances,
and possibly in all, some material was purposely buried with
the dead. For example, in one case, six well made projectile points were found very near a skeleton. The skeletal
material was very fragmentary in most cases, and difficult
to excavate in the dense, hard black clay. In a nearby plot,
Richard Worthington excavated two elliptical bone objects
about 5 inches in diameter, along with bone awls and chipped-flint artifacts.
Plot VII contained at least four burials. One was extended with the legs crossed. In the same plot was found a
"killed" boatstone or atlatl weight of green granite. The
fragments fitted together to make a complete, beau tifully
shaped boatstone 96 mm. long (Plates 36, K; 37, C) . It is
well shaped and polished over the whole surface, including
the deep trough in th e upper side. The sides pinch together

toward the middle of the top or troughed side, so that the
width of the top is greater at the ends than it is in the middle. In the same plot, a number of awl-like bone tools were
found near the skull of the extended burial, although they
could not positively be associated with it. Possibly these
awl-like artifacts (not illustrated) were hair fasteners .
CACHE OF BONE IMPLEMENTS
In plot VIII a skull was uncovered 18 inches below the
surface. In contact with it and slightly lower was a second
skull (Plate 35, A). Limb bones were found nearby which
probably belonged with one of these skulls (Plate 35, B) .
About one foot in front of the first skull was a cache of bone
artifacts, most of them fragmentary, but a few complete or
nearly so. These bones were criss-crossed and tightly matted
together in the very hard clay, so that it was impossible to
remove them all intact (Plate 35, C) . Most of these objects
had been badly broken by roots and we were fortunate in
getting most of them out without further damage. The
cache lay between 12 and 18 inches deep and its proximity
to the two skulls suggested it was associated with at least
one of them. Whether the two skulls belonged to a double
burial, or to separate interments, could not be determined.
Plate 36, A-H shows the eight most complete implements
from this cache. The first two specimens are shown enlarged in Plate 37, A, B. In Plate 38, most of the remaining
fragmentary specimens are shown, laid in rows which are
labeled A to L . The pieces in each row are not necessarily
from the same implements, although in some cases they are.
The 44 fragments in Plate 38, added to the eight specimens
in Plate 36, gives a total of 52 bone objects from this cache.
These 44 fragments appear to come from at least 18 different artifacts, which gives a minimum of 26 implements.
possibly the actual total is between 30 and 35.
The great majority of these implements are probably
made from bison cannon bone, split lengthwise. They are
fairly flat, except for the gently convex outer surface of
the bone, although a few are rather round in cross-section:
It may be supposed that the flat implements (those in P late

234

36, A-H, and some of those in Plate 38) were used as awls

in weaving such things as plaited mats or baskets. Rounded
tips, such as those in rows C, E, and H in Plate 38 suggest
flaking tools. The slender pin with flanged head and round
cross-section in row G, Plate 38, may have had a distinct
function, perhaps that of a hair fastener. At any rate, a
variety of uses is indicated by the cache as a whole.
It may be noted that the flat implements are both plain
and neatly incised with geometric designs on the outer or
convex surface. Eyes appear at the head of both plain and
decorated implements, and on both flat and rounded forms,
although the majority are not eyed. Plate 36, G has tiny
dots alongside the sets of parallel diagonal lines. In a general way, the incised decorations, including dots, are similar
to those found on the rim zone of pottery vessels of the type
Goose Creek Incised.2 Potsherds from this site also belong
to Goose Creek ware, from which an affiliation with the
Galveston Bay Focus may be assumed for at least part of
the site.3

Examples of projectile points, a snub-nosed scraper, and
a knife from this site are shown in Plate 39. Sandstone
hones have also been found.
As all of our time after finding the cache was devoted to
removing it, we decided to search for additional burials at
a later date. Meanwhile, the creek bed was dug out and
about 20 feet of dirt was piled on top of the site. This was
leveled again, and about 3 feet of dirt now covers it. If
sufficient interest justifies it, the original plots can be relocated by use of our many photographs which show their
relation to the trees in the background.
