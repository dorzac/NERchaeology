ABSTRACT
An archaeological evaluation of a proposed school site (17 acres) in central
Montgomery County, Texas was performed by Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA)
in April 2003 with William E. Moore the Principal Investigator. This project falls under the
Antiquities Code of Texas and was performed under Antiquities Permit 3107 issued by the
Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division for this project. No previously recorded
sites exist within 1/2 kilometer of the project area, and no archaeological sites were found
during the archaeological survey. Therefore, it is recommended that the Conroe
Independent School District (ISD) be allowed to proceed with construction as planned with
no further archaeological investigations. Copies of this report are on file at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL); Texas Historical Commission, Archeology
Division; Conroe ISD; and Brazos Valley Research Associates.

INTRODUCTION
Brazos Valley Research Associates was retained by the Conroe ISD through the
engineering firm HBC Terracon of Houston, Texas to conduct an archaeological
investigation of a 17 acre tract, the site of a proposed school in central Montgomery County
(Figure 1). The project area is depicted on the USGS 7.5' topographic map Conroe dated
1958 [photorevised 1976] (map number 3095-132) (Figure 2). The area to be investigated
is located within the city limits of Conroe, Texas on the west side of Interstate Highway 45.
It is bounded on the north by vacant land, on the south by vacant land, on the east by
apartments, and on the west by vacant land (Figure 3).
Montgomery County is located in Southeast Texas, an area known to contain
significant archaeological sites.
A summary of previous work by professional
archaeologists in the county is summarized in the Previous Investigations section below.
Because of the archaeological potential of the project area, especially the northeast corner,
a cultural resource study by a professional archaeologist was warranted according to the
Antiquities Code of Texas. This project was conducted under Antiquities Permit Number
3107.
The project number assigned by BVRA is 03-10. The field survey was conducted
on April 17, 2003 by Edward P. Baxter with William E. Moore assuming the duties and
responsibilities of Principal Investigator.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The following statements was summarized from the Handbook of Texas (Webb
1952) and the Soil Survey of Montgomery County (McClintock et al. 1972:1). Montgomery
County, in the East Texas Timberlands Region, is bounded on the north by Walker and
San Jacinto counties, on the east by Liberty County, on the south by Harris County, and on
the west by Waller and Grimes counties. Montgomery County covers 1047 square miles of
flat to gently rolling terrain. Vegetation is typical of the Piney Woods area with thick stands
of longleaf, shortleaf, and loblolly pines and hickory, maple, sweet gum and black gum,
oak, and magnolia trees. Grasses include Virginia Wildrye, blackseed needle grass, and
purpletop. Wildlife in the county includes eastern gray and fox squirrels, various species of
bats and skunks, and small herbivores such as gophers, mice, rabbits, and armadillos, as
well as racoons, white-tailed deer, opossum, bobcat, coyote, and red and gray fox.
Alligators, frogs, toads, and numerous species of snake, including the poisonous
copperhead, cottonmouth, coral snake, and rattlesnake, are found in abundance. A wide
variety of birds such as mockingbirds, cardinals, doves, quail, bluejays, and roadrunners, to
name a few are also native to the area. The county's principal water source is the San
Jacinto River basin drainage system, which includes Peach, Caney, Spring, and Bushy
creeks.
The climate is subtropical humid with warm summers and mild winters. The
average annual relative humidity is 73 percent, and the average rainfall is 47.44 inches.
The average annual temperature is 68 degrees Fahrenheit. Temperatures in January
range from an average low of 39 degrees to an average high of 61 degrees and in July
range from 72 degrees to 95 degrees. The growing season averages 270 days per year
with the last freeze in early March and the first freeze in late November (Webb 1952).
The following statements were taken from the Soil Survey of Montgomery County,
Texas (McClintock et al. 1972:1). Montgomery County is in the southeastern part of Texas
in the land resource area of the East Texas Timberlands, Blackland Prairie, and the Gulf
Coast Prairies. The northern and western parts of the county are undulating; the south and
southeastern parts are level to gently sloping. Elevation varies between 79 feet in the
southern part of the county to 330 feet in the northwestern part.
According to the soil survey (Sheet 38), the entire 17 acre project area is located
within one soil type. This is Boy fine sand (B0), part of the Boy Series (McClintock et al.
1972:9-10). Soils in the Boy Series consist of nearly level to gently sloping deep,
moderately well drained soils that are sandy to a depth of 40 to 60 inches and have a
mottled loamy lower layer. These soils are on uplands. A typical profile consists of sand (7
inches thick), loamy fine sand (40 inches thick), and sandy clay loam to a depth of more
than 70 inches. These soils have a low available water capacity. Boy soils are used
mainly for pine timber, but a few areas have been cleared for crops and pasture.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Montgomery County is located in the Southeast Texas Archeological Study Region
of the Eastern Planning Region as defined by the Department of Antiquities Protection in
Archeology in the Eastern Planning Region, Texas: A Planning Document (Kenmotsu and
Perttula 1993). It is located in the Southeast Texas cultural-geographical region (Region 6)
as defined by Biesaart et al. (1985:88-90) in a statistical overview. At the time the overview
was published, Montgomery County was 14th in the region with 62 known archeological
sites. The 62 sites comprised 3.81% of the region and .31% of the state. As of March 12,
2003, there were 187 known prehistoric and historic sites in Montgomery County (TARL
site files).
The Archeological Bibliography for the Southeastern Region of Texas (Moore 1989)
cites 87 references for the county. Although many of these investigations have been small
area surveys, often resulting in no sites being recorded, several projects involving larger
areas have been conducted. The following is a discussion of previous work in Montgomery
County.
The first site to be recorded in the county is a Late Prehistoric site (41MQ1) on the
West Fork of the San Jacinto River documented by E. Mott Davis of the Anthropology
Department, The University of Texas at Austin, during a field trip to Montgomery County in
1956. Following this visit by E. Mott Davis, the county remained virtually unexplored until
1965 when archaeologists working for the Texas Archeological Salvage Project (TASP)
surveyed an area to be affected by the proposed Conroe Reservoir (Shafer 1966). As a
result of this survey 32 sites (41MQ4-41MQ36) were recorded, and three were
recommended for testing.
In the spring of 1967, three sites (41MQ4 - 41MQ6) recorded during the Lake
Conroe survey were tested by TASP (Shafer 1968). These excavations provided the first
substantial body of data for Montgomery County and made it possible for the first time to
discuss the archaeology of the area based on artifacts excavated under controlled
conditions.
The next major archaeological project in the county occurred in 1971-1974 when
the Kirbee Kiln (41MQ38), a pottery near the town of Montgomery that was in operation in
the late 1850s, was excavated (Malone et al. 1979). This is the only historic site in the
county to be excavated, and its importance is reflected in the fact that it is the first reported
excavation of a "groundhog" type kiln in Texas. This is also the first site in the county to be
entered in the National Register of Historic Places.

In 1975, eight years after the Lake Conroe excavations, an archaeological survey
was conducted in the Sam Houston National Forest adjacent to Lake Conroe (Shafer and
Baxter 1975). Three sites (41MQ41 - 41MQ43) were recorded in Montgomery County, and
two sites (41WA81 - 41WA82) were recorded in Walker County.
During the summer of 1975, site 41MQ41 was tested by archaeologists from Texas
A&M University (Shafer and Stearns 1975). This site is located in the area to be affected
by construction of the Scott's Ridge Recreational Area. This effort was very significant at
the time as it provided an opportunity for archaeologists to test and confirm the hypothesis
that "prehistoric sites having considerable antiquity do occur on older landforms in the
area" (Shafer and Stearns 1975:37). The work conducted at Lake Conroe only sampled
sites on recent geomorphic features. The Scott's Ridge site, however, represents the first
site investigated in the area that could be "tentatively placed in the Early and Middle Lithic
Periods" (Shafer and Stearns 1975:37).
In 1977, the proposed Texas Loop Pipeline route was examined by the
Anthropology Laboratory, Texas A&M University (Taylor 1979). The 300 km pipeline
passed through the eastern section of the county, and two sites (41MQ45 - 41MQ46) were
recorded in the right-of-way. It was recommended that the area around the crossing of the
West Fork of the San Jacinto River be closely monitored during construction. Specific
recommendations for the Montgomery County sites were not found in the report.
Probably the largest area to be investigated in the county was the site of the
proposed Woodlands Development, a tract of 23,000 acres in the southern part of the
county along Spring Creek. The project was initiated by the Coastal Zone Resources
Division of Ocean Data Systems, Inc. under subcontract with Greiner Engineering
Sciences, Inc. (1980) of Tampa, Florida in 1979. In all, this project recorded 12 prehistoric
sites (41MQ63 - 41MQ74). Six of the sites are associated with the Neo-American or Late
Prehistoric (corresponds to the Ceramic Period as defined by Shafer and Stearns); 2 sites
contained both Neo-American (Ceramic Period) and Archaic (Lithic Period) components,
and 4 sites were classified by the authors as "undifferentiated" prehistoric. No historic sites
or standing structures were encountered. Not one of the 12 sites was eligible for
nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. Except for sites 41MQ70 and
41MQ73, no further work was recommended. The majority of sites are described as "small
and unproductive, possibly short-term or transitory habitation localities."
In 1979, the Houston Archeological Society conducted archeological investigations
in Montgomery County (Operation Neidigk) under the supervision of William L. McClure
(1979). The archaeologists searched for the location of one of the historic Akokisa village
sites identified by H. E. Bolton (Texas in the Middle 18th Century). Due to private
construction associated with Neidigk Lake, their efforts were unsuccessful. The results of
their efforts is reported on in the Houston Archeological Society Newsletter volume 63.

In 1981, sites 41MQ70 and 41MQ73 were tested by Greiner Engineering Sciences,
Inc. (1981) in order to determine their eligibility for the National Register of Historic Places.
Site 41MQ70 was found to be not eligible, and site 41MQ73 was found to be potentially
eligible.
In 1984, two prehistoric sites recorded in 1977 (41MQ45 - 41MQ46) during the
Texas Loop Pipeline route by Taylor (1979) were tested by Heartfield, Price & Greene, Inc.
(1984).
In 1986, archaeologists from the Texas Archeological Survey incorporated
geomorphological, ethnohistorical, historical, and archaeological studies into their survey of
the proposed Lake Creek Reservoir (Bement et al. 1987). An area of 3570 acres (20% of
the reservoir flood pool) was examined, and 46 prehistoric sites (41MQ75 - 41MQ120),
four with historic components, were located and recorded in the most definitive study of an
area in Montgomery County to date.
In 1990, the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) conducted a survey of the
proposed wastewater treatment facilities in the Town of Woodloch (Jurgens 1990). This
study revealed prehistoric site 41MQ55 to be potentially significant, and testing was
recommended. In November of 1990, testing was conducted by Brazos Valley Research
Associates (Moore 1990) under the direction of William E. Moore and Roger G. Moore. It
was determined that additional work was needed in order to determine the eligibility of this
site for the National Register of Historic Places.
The most recent project on a large scale was an archaeological survey of
approximately 262 acres in central Montgomery County by Moore Archeological Consulting
(Schubert et al. 2002). The entire development consists of approximately 11,000 acres;
however, the Corps of Engineers only required that a smaller sample be examined. A twostage investigation was conducted; Stage 1 consisted of shovel testing, site delineation,
and excavation of test units, while Stage 2 completed site testing and conducted backhoe
trenching. The investigation was limited to areas along Fish Creek, one of its tributaries,
and the location of two smaller water control structures. Five prehistoric sites (41MQ175 41MQ179) were recorded during the Stage I survey, all of them along Fish Creek. Each of
the five sites was in settings with deep sandy soil. The sites were not recommended for
further work.
In addition to the projects discussed above, there have been several small area
surveys, many of which did not locate sites. Those that did record sites in Montgomery
County include surveys by Fox (1980), Drollinger (1986), Voellinger (1981), Nash (1991),
Moore and Moore (1992), and Moore (1993). Several sites have been recorded by
individuals, most of which are documented only in the site records at TARL.

A literature search was conducted by Wayne Bartholomew (1986). His work was
sponsored by TARL and involved a study of a ten county area. In Montgomery County,
41MQ3 (previously recorded) was assessed, and site 41MQ58 was recorded. Roger G.
Moore of Moore Archeological Consulting conducted a preliminary cultural resources
assessment of the proposed Spring Lake Reservoir in which he (Moore 1991), along with a
geomorhpologist, identified high probability areas for prehistoric sites and discussed
predictive modelling for the area. An overview of the ethnohistorical and archaeological
resources of the proposed reservoir locations for the San Jacinto Project, Montgomery and
San Jacinto counties, was prepared by Douglas K. Boyd and Van Tries Button (1985) for
the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation.

METHODS
Prior to entering the field, a records check for previously recorded sites in or near
the project area was conducted by Allegra Azulay at TARL. The Project Archaeologist
visited the project area on April 17, 2003. The area was examined by a 100 percent
pedestrian survey accompanied by shovel testing. Vegetation at the time of this survey
consisted of a pine forest with mixed hardwoods such as magnolias, yaupon, and a few
oaks. In general, the surface visibility varied between 10 and 30 percent. Prior to this
investigation the area had been surveyed and flagged making identification easy. The
northwest corner of the project area, the highest elevation in the 17 acres, was viewed as
the most likely location for a prehistoric or historic site. It is in this area that the majority of
the shovel tests (n=5) were excavated. The rest of the project area consists of slopes to
the south and west, and fewer tests were dug in these low probability areas. Two of the
shovel tests excavated in the southeast corner were close to an exposed cutbank that was
visually inspected for cultural materials. A digital camera was used to document the field
conditions present during the survey. In all, 10 shovel tests were excavated within the 17
acre tract. All shovel tests were located by use of a hand held GPS. The UTM coordinates
were transferred onto a mapping program based on a 7.5 USGS topographic map.
Information regarding the depth and results of each test is presented in Appendix I, and the
approximate location of the 10 tests is shown on Figure 3. All earth excavated through
shovel testing was screened using 1/4" hardware cloth, and a shovel test log was kept.

RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
A check of site records at TARL revealed there are no previously recorded sites
within 1/2 kilometer of the project area. The area was examined through shovel testing,
and no previously unrecorded sites were found. Shovel testing revealed deep sandy soils
throughout the area with depths of nine of the tests ranging between 80 and 100 cm. Not
one of the tests encountered clay. Most of the project area is located on a slope of a hill
with only a small portion on what can be interpreted as high ground. Overall, the project
area is viewed as a low probability area for significant archaeological sites. It is possible
that a site may be present on top of the landform to the north, but this is outside the project
area. It is, therefore, recommended that the Conroe ISD be allowed to proceed with
construction as planned with no additional archaeological investigations. It is always
possible that areas containing cultural resources are missed during any archaeological
survey. Should any evidence of an archaeological site not discussed in this report be
encountered during construction of the proposed water line, work in that area should cease
until the situation can be evaluated by the Texas Historical Commission in consultation with
Brazos Valley Research Associates and the Conroe ISD.
