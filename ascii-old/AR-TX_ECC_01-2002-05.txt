1.0 PROJECT BACKGROUND
1.1

The Proposed Undertaking

On June 5-7, 2007, Ecological Communications Corporation (EComm) conducted an
archeological inventory along 3.3 miles (5.3 km) of State Highway (SH) 78 between
Spring Creek Parkway and SH 205 in Collin County, Texas. The road widening is being
conducted for the Dallas District of the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT).
EComm conducted the archeological survey under subcontract to HDR Engineering, Inc.
The proposed reconstruction and realignment activities include widening of the existing
SH 78 two-lane roadway to six lanes. From 100 meters east of Spring Creek Parkway to
450 meters east of SH 205, the road will be expanded to six 12-foot lanes with a 15-foot
wide grass median to separate the opposing lanes.
The object of the inventory was to identify and document archeological resources that
could be impacted by the proposed road improvements in compliance with the
Antiquities Code of Texas and federal regulation 36 CFR Part 800, which pertain to
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) (16 U.S.C. 470 et seq.).
The work was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 4541.
1.2

The Area of Potential Effect

The Area of Potential Effect (APE) for this project is 3.3 miles (5.3 km) in length. The
typical section of the project area includes a 120 ft existing ROW, which would be
widened to up to 170 ft. New ROW acquisition could occur on either or both sides of the
existing roadway, thus necessitating archeological inventory of 170 ft (52 m) on both
sides. The total APE is therefore approximately 52 acres.
The project area is located on the Lavon and Wylie USGS 1:24,000 topographic
quadrangles (Figure 1).
1.3

Land Ownership

Land within the existing ROW is owned by TxDOT. New ROW will be acquired from
private owners.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
2.1

Physiography

The project area is located in the southeast portion of Collin County. All of Collin
County lies within the Blackland Prairie ecoregion.
The APE contains the East Fork of the Trinity River, which is the primary feeder stream
for Lavon and Ray Hubbard Reservoirs, and Pilot Grove Creek, which flows from a
swampy area north of SH 78 through two three-foot concrete pipes under the south side
of the highway and south to Ray Hubbard Reservoir.
2.2

Climate

Collin County is located within a mild subtropical climatic zone. The average yearly
rainfall is 40 inches; the average temperature ranges from a low of 31Â°F during January
to 94Â°F in July (National Weather Service 2007).
2.3

Geology and Soils

The bedrock geology encountered within the project area is mostly comprised of claymarl deposits of the Ozan Formation (Ko), a division of the Taylor Group (uK3). The
Ozan formation extends approximately 130 m in depth and rests upon an upper base of
the Austin Chalk group. These deposits formed approximately 75 million years ago
during the Upper Cretaceous period when the region was located within a vast shallow
sea that extended through the center of the North American continent, connecting the
Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean (Sellards et al. 1932; TCEQ 2004).
Late Pleistocene aged gravel, clay, and silt fluvial terrace deposits (Qt) are mapped
within the eastern portion of the project area in proximity to the intersection of SH 205
and SH 78. These deposits rest thinly upon an upper base of Ozan marl (Ko) with one
exposure noted during fieldwork. Within the Trinity River floodplain, Holocene
Quaternary alluvium (Qal) blanket the surface to depths of 30 feet (Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality [TCEQ] 2004).
USDA soil maps for Collin County indicate that soils within the APE have little potential
for intact, deeply buried cultural deposits. Soils are dominantly Tinn Clay (35%), Altoga
Clay (25%), and Burleson Clay (19%) with smaller portions of Leson Clay (6%),
Lewisville Clay (5%), and Houston Black Clay (4%) (Hanson and Wheeler 1969).
The Tinn Clay has the following pedon.
0-5 in (0-13 cm) very dark gray (10YR 3/1) clay
5-14 in (13-36 cm) dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay
14-56 in (36-142 cm) dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay

The Altoga Clay has the following pedon.
0-7 in (0-18 cm) light brownish-gray (10YR 4/1) light silty clay
7-25 in (18-64 cm) pale brown (10YR 6/3) light silty clay
25-60 in (64-152 cm) very pale brown (10YR 7/3) light silty clay
60-66 in (152-168 cm) very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silty clay
The Burleson Clay has the following pedon
0-6 in (0-15 cm) dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay
6-22 in (15-56 cm) dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay
22-33 in (56-84 cm) dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay
33-54 in (84-137 cm) gray (10YR 5/1) clay
54-75 in (137-191 cm) light olive-brown (2.5Y 5/4) clay
The Leson Clay has the following pedon (Goerdel 2001).
0-14 in (0-36 cm) black (10YR2/1) clay
14-36 in (36-91 cm) black (10YR 2/1) clay
36-48 in (91-122 cm) very dark grayish-brown (10YR 3/2) clay
48-70 in (122-178 cm) mottled dark grayish-brown (10YR 4/2) and brown (10YR
5/3) clay
70-80 in (178-203 cm) mottled brown (10YR 5/3) and yellowish brown (10YR
5/8) stratified clay
The Lewisville Silty Clay has the following pedon.
0-6 in (0-15 cm) dark grayish-brown (10YR 4/2) light silty clay
6-16 in (15-41 cm) dark grayish-brown (10YR 4/2) light silty clay
16-34 in (41-86 cm) grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay
34-64 (86 -163 cm) pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay
The Houston Black Clay has the following pedon.
0-6 in (0-15 cm) very dark gray (10YR 3/1) clay
6-22 in (15-56 cm) very dark gray (10YR 3/1) clay
22-44 in (56-112 cm) very dark gray (10YR 3/1) clay
44-60 in (112-152 cm) light gray (10YR 7/1) clay
60-70 in 152- 203 cm) light gray (2.5Y 7/2) clay
These soil horizons are adequately investigated by shovel testing: all are deep dark clays
over marl or shale and have limited potential to contain deeply buried archeological
deposits.

Typical vegetation currently encountered within Collin county includes pecan (Carya
illinoiensis), shumard oak (Quercus shumardii), bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa), black
walnut (Juglans cinera L.), hackberry (Celtis spp.), bois dâarc (Maclura pomifera),
buffalo grass (Buchloe dactyloides), bluestem (Bothriochloa laguroides), blue grama
(Bouteloua gracilis), and Texas prickly pear (Opuntia lindheimeri) (Preston 1976). The
project area is located within the Texan Biotic Province as defined by Blair (1950).
Typical mammalian fauna commonly observed within this region include opossum
(Didelphis marsupialis), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), raccoon (Procyon lotor),
nine-band armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), bobcat (Lynx rufus), and coyote (Canis
latrans) (Davis and Schmidly 1994).
2.5

Current Land Use and Recent Environmental Alterations

Currently the land along much of the APE is either multi-use agricultural land, wooded
(frequently flooded portions), or subdivisions in development. At the western extent of
the project area there is a buildup of commercial properties associated with the City of
Wylie. The Saint Louis Southwestern Railroad parallels the project area immediately
north of SH 78. Railroad construction involved filling and altering the natural surface
along the north side of the eastern portion of the project area.
Along the entire project area, cutting and filling associated with road leveling, revetment,
and drainage as well as construction of private and commercial driveways have
eliminated much of the original soil surface. Older roads (including abandoned portions
of Texas 78) are visible as spurs and short black-topped drives along the western portion
of the study area, suggesting further loss of original surface.
Lavon dam is located north of the central portion of the study area with the gated
spillway about 700 meters (2,300 feet) north of SH 78. The Trinity River and Pilot
Grove Creek create a frequently inundated floodplain along approximately 3,500 meters
(2.1 miles) of SH 78 within the project area.
Figures 2 and 3 show views of the project area.

3.0 RESEARCH ORIENTATION

3.1

Cultural Historical Framework

The project area is located within the central portion of the North Central Texas
archeological region.
The cultural history of the project area is generally divided into four major time periods:
Paleoindian (9000-6500 B.C.), Archaic (6500 B.C. to A.D. 750), Late Prehistoric
(roughly A.D. 700-1600), and Historic (A.D. 1600 to present) (Prewitt 1981). The
prehistoric periods are principally defined by the presence of diagnostic projectile points
and other technologies, but are intended to delineate change in socio-cultural patterns.
However, cultural change proceeded at somewhat different rates over the vast area of
Texas; in some regions, hunting and gathering cultures persisted throughout prehistory; in
others, cultures with farming and settled village life dominated. Prehistoric cultures in
North Central Texas appeared to maintain a hunter-gatherer lifestyle throughout the
Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods, with moderate changes in technology.
Paleoindian
The earliest known time of human occupation in North America is the Paleoindian
Period. In north Texas, it is generally considered to date from about 11,000 to about
8,500 years before present (BP). The archeological evidence suggests that during this
time the earliest residents of northern Texas were highly nomadic hunters and gatherers
(Brown and Lebo 1990:16). Populations were likely small and dispersed and exploited a
variety of wild food resources. The economy was based on a lithic technology. Large
leaf-shaped projectile points, such as the widespread Folsom and Clovis, are diagnostic of
this time period and suggest that mega-fauna such as extinct bison were key resources.
Within the grasslands of North Central Texas, a generalized hunting and gathering
subsistence economy was characteristic.
Archeological sites dating to this period are often found deeply buried near water sources.
A small number of archeological sites dating to this earliest time period are known to
occur in north-central Texas. In the counties surrounding the project area (Collin, Cooke,
Denton, Grayson, Hunt, Dallas, and Rockwall), only six archeological sites have been
dated to the Paleoindian Period (Biesaart et al. 1985), or about 2% of the total datable
sites recorded. Over the 2,500 year span of the Paleoindian Period, this calculates to
about one known site per 415 years of occupation. As a consequence of this scarcity,
these inherently valuable archeological sites are usually considered to be significant
cultural resources.

Archaic
Much of Texas prehistory is subsumed within the Archaic, a long time span dominated
by hunting and gathering societies. The period is notable for changes in the style of
projectile points and tools and the introduction of grinding implements and ground-stone
ornaments. This indicates a gradually increasing population that utilized abundant plant
and animal resources of environments similar to those of modern times. The primary
weapon during the Archaic was the spearthrower or atlatl. Climatic patterns surely
vacillated during the Archaic, but were generally warmer than the Paleoindian period.
Near the end of the Paleoindian Period, global climate began to change slowly, becoming
gradually warmer and dryer (Brown and Lebo 1990:16). In response, plant and animal
populations also changed and the human populations in north Texas began to exploit a
wider variety of food resources. Large game was no longer the primary focus of
subsistence. Changes in technology included a more diverse suite of lithic tools,
increased use of grinding stones and the development of basketry. Pottery is absent. This
adaptation is known as the Archaic Period and has been dated in north Texas as occurring
between about 8500 BP and 1250 BP. The Archaic Period is subdivided into the Early
Archaic (8500-6000 BP), the Middle Archaic (6000-3500 BP), and the Late Archaic
(3500-1250 BP). Each of these subdivisions has characteristic types of artifacts,
especially projectile points, which suggest differences in economy and possibly regional
affiliations.
Of the more than 300 datable prehistoric archeological sites recorded in surrounding
counties, 53% date to the Archaic Period (Biesaart et al. 1985). Over the 7,250 year span
of the Archaic Period, this calculates to about one known site per 40 years of occupation,
a five-fold increase over the Paleoindian Period. Archaic period archeological sites are
thus not quite so rare as are Paleoindian sites, but their data potential can be significant,
especially if they are undisturbed. Consequently, a high proportion of Archaic Period
sites are considered to be significant cultural resources.
Late Prehistoric
During the Late Prehistoric Period (1250-250 BP), major changes in technology were
adopted by the people living in North Central Texas. The development of ceramics and
the introduction of the bow and arrow allowed significant changes in economic strategies
and consequent social structures. Also during this time, cultigens such as maize appeared
in the diet (Brown and Lebo 1990:16). It is uncertain whether these were locally
produced or were acquired through trading, but either way, the economy was much
diversified over the previous Archaic Period. Settlement patterns also changed, shifting to
larger villages that included houses (Ferring and Yates 1997:6). At about 1060 BP there
is some evidence that the climate in north Texas became somewhat drier. Bison, largely
absent from archeological sites during the first half of the Late Prehistoric, spread over
the plains of north Texas and became a vital subsistence resource (Brown and Lebo
1990:16).

Archeological Survey Along SH 78, Collin County, Texas

During the Historic Native American Period (250-100 BP), contact with Europeans to the
south and east intensified and the widespread use of metal tools, firearms, and the horse
altered and largely replaced earlier economic and social adaptations. During this period
of early contact, the Wichita peoples practiced limited cultivation in northern Texas
(Prikryl 1987:178). During the 18th and 19th centuries the Comanche migrated from the
northern plains into much of Texas. On the eastern margins of the area were the Caddo
peoples.
Of the more than 300 datable prehistoric archeological sites recorded in surrounding
counties, about 45% date to the Late Prehistoric Period (Biesaart et al. 1985). This
calculates to about one known site per 7 years of occupation during the 1,150 years of
this time period, a five fold increase over the preceding Archaic period and a 30 fold
increase over the Paleoindian Period. This higher density of archeological sites dating to
the Late Prehistoric Period is likely due to a combination of variables, including better
preserved (and thus more likely to be discovered) sites as well as possibly higher levels
of human population. Consequently, Late Prehistoric Period sites are not uncommon in
northern Texas. Their significance is evaluated with respect to degree of preservation, site
type, and artifact content.
Historic
The Spanish were the first Europeans to enter North Central Texas but their influence
over the region was minimal, with no local settlement of the Collin County area
occurring until encouraged by the Republic (and later, the State) of Texas from 18401860. The county was officially incorporated by subdividing Fannin County in 1846
(Minor 2004).
In the 1870s, railroads arrived in the county, thus creating an agricultural boom largely
based on cotton farming. This boom continued well into the 20th Century, finally
declining steadily after World War 2 (Minor 2004). From the late 1970s to present,
exponential expansion of Dallas led to a housing boom in its suburbs, especially Plano in
Collin County. During this time, population in the area has increased dramatically as
more small towns, such as Lavon and Wylie, have become part of suburbia, thus
necessitating larger transportation arteries and increasing the capacity of existing roads.
The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USCOE) Fort Worth District built Lavon
reservoir as a flood control project from 1948 to 1954. From 1970 to 1975, the dam was
added to raise Lavon pool elevation 20 feet (Wendy Hinds, personal communication,
June 13, 2007).

Previous Investigations

A search of THC records revealed that SH 78 had previously been partially surveyed
within the project APE. A pedestrian survey performed in June, 1989 covered the ROW
from the Dallas County line in Sachse, Texas to the eastern edge of the Wylie, TX USGS
1:24000 topographic quadrangle (96Âº 30â). The 1989 survey overlaps the current
projectâs extent by approximately 800 meters (1/2 mile). In addition, a linear survey was
undertaken approximately 200 meters (650 feet) north of SH 78 from FM 544 in Wylie to
about 2,100 meters (1.3 miles) east of the study areaâs western boundary in May, 2001 by
TxDOT archeologists. None of these surveys resulted in the discovery of any
archeological sites within 5 km (3.2 miles) of the project area.
3.3

Previously Recorded Sites

The THC atlas shows no previously recorded sites within the project APE; four known
sites are located within 2 miles (3.2 km) of the APE. None of these sites has been
determined eligible for listing on the NRHP.
Â Site 41COL7 is located approximately 100 m (330 feet) south of SH 78 and may
extend within the current APE. This site was recorded in 1963 as an open village
site containing âbroken dart points and knivesâ. It measured â150 yards by 100
yardsâ (about 3 acres). No features are known. Recorded prior to the NHPA, the
eligibility and research value of the site is unknown.
Â Site 41COL44 is located about 300 m (.2 miles) north of SH 78. It was originally
recorded by R.L. Stephenson in 1948 during the River Basin Surveys and is
described as a âpottery campsiteâ about 0.5 acres in size. The site was heavily
eroded at that time and no further investigations were recommended.
Â Site 41COL41 is located about 700 m (.4 miles) north of SH 78. This site was also
recorded by R.L. Stephenson in 1948 during the River Basin Surveys. It is
described as a ânon-pottery campsiteâ measuring about 0.5 acre in area. Some
projectile points were noted but are not described. No further investigations were
recommended.
Â Site 41COL10 is located approximately 2300 m (1.4 miles) north of SH 78. This
site was also recorded in 1948 during the River Basin Surveys. It is described as an
âopen occupation areaâ measuring about 1-2 acres in area. The site has been
inundated by Lavon Lake.

4.0 METHODS
4.1

Field Methods

Field methods for this project were in compliance with the THCâs standards for
archeological projects. The archeological inventory consisted of a 100% pedestrian
archeological survey of both sides of the ROW. The survey involved careful examination
of the ground surface and any existing subsurface exposures. Locations for shovel tests
were established at a rate of approximately 16 per linear mile (one per 100 m) of survey
transect along each side of the ROW. If the ground surface at any location was highly
disturbed, this was noted on the field map and no test was excavated. At these locations
the ground was observed in a 2.5 meter radius around the location of the scheduled test to
see if any artifacts had been brought to the surface by machinery. The UTM locations of
all locations were recorded using a hand-held GPS receiver.
If the ground had no clear evidence of disturbance, then a shovel test was excavated.
Shovel tests were manually excavated in arbitrary 20 cm levels to the pre-cultural clay
horizon. Tests were 30 cm in diameter and all excavated sediments were screened
through Â¼-in mesh. No artifacts were collected.
Field methods called for any test containing prehistoric or historic artifacts (exclusive of
recent debris) to be further investigated with additional tests placed at 5-10 m intervals in
radial directions. Any location with more than two positive tests or with more than two
different types of artifacts in the same test (ceramics, lithics, etc.) was to be designated as
an archeological site. All sites were to be assigned a temporary field number and
recorded on State of Texas forms, photographed, sketch mapped, and plotted on the
USGS topographic quadrangle.
No prospective trenching was conducted.
4.2

Curation

No artifacts were collected. Site records will be prepared and submitted for permanent
curation at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin.

5.0 RESULTS
The project location was found to vary from fairly well-drained agricultural land and
subdivisions to heavily wooded floodplains. The ground surface in the area was largely
disturbed due to road construction and water containment earthworks. Much of the
project area has buried utility cable and petroleum pipelines marked along both sides of
the road. In areas in proximity to the subdivisions, soils had been bladed and ditches
excavated to allow for water runoff along the road. During the visit, much of the ROW,
especially areas close to the Trinity River, was inundated with pooled water.
No cultural materials were observed on the ground surface within the APE. Recent trash
such as glass bottles and plastic debris was present in the area but these were clearly less
than 50 years old and were disregarded.
Shovel tests were attempted at 58 locations along the ROW. Twenty-four locations were
along the north side of the ROW and 34 were along the south. The locations of all tests
are plotted in Figure 5. At eight of the test locations (13%) no test was dug because the
ground surface was observed to be highly disturbed. At 11 of the test locations (19%)
water inundation from recent rain and seasonal pooling prevented any testing or direct
observation. Tests were dug at the remaining 39 locations. Of these, 31 tests (80%)
encountered dark gray to gray (10YR 4/1, 5/1, or 6/1) clay loam between the surface and
20 centimeters below surface (cmbs). The remaining eight tests (21%) found a variety of
brownish gray to reddish brown (10YR 6/2, 5/2, 4/2, 4/4, and 2.5Y 4/4) sandy clay loam
between 0 and 20 cmbs, possibly imported material from road construction. No cultural
remains were present in any shovel test.
No cultural resource sites are present within the APE.

6.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The field survey found that much of the project APE outside of the existing ROW has
been disturbed by new construction and water containment earthworks. Within the
ROW, the roadway largely sits atop fill material scraped laterally from the surrounding
area, thus thoroughly disturbing most of the APE. In other areas (mainly east of the
Trinity River) the roadbed has been cut down to decrease grade, thus removing native
soil to culturally sterile levels.
In all parts of the APE, the pre-cultural argillic horizon was found to be at very shallow
depths. Clay was frequently observed at the surface and was generally encountered
above 5 cmbs. No shovel test found clay deeper than 20 cmbs.
The inventory encountered no cultural resources anywhere in the APE either on the
surface or beneath the surface.
No historic properties will be directly affected by the proposed road widening and no
further archeological work is warranted.
