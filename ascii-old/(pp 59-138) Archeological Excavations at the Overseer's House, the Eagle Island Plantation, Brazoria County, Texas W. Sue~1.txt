ABSTRACT
During 1984 and 1985 the Brazosport Archaeological Society investigated
a house site on the former Eagle Island Plantation, in the present town of Clute in
Brazoria County, Texas. The excavations exposed parts of the brick foundations
of a rectangular building, an outbuilding, and a cistern. We concluded that the
rectangular building was the home of the overseer and his family because it was
beside the elevated roads leading to the main house, fields, slave quarters, sugar
mill, and river landing, and the earliest (late 1830s) residential artifacts recovered
were there. The house was later occupied by one or more working class farm
families, probably black tenant farmers, until sometime after 1875, when it was
abandoned as a residence and became a storage and dump site.

DISCOVERY
In December 1983 the Brazosport Archaeological Society, at the request of the
Brazoria County Historical Commission, located the earliest Wharton family
cemetery (Daughters of the American Revolution in Texas 1965; Pollan 1984). A
map (Figure 1), drawn in 1958 by Sarah Wharton Groce Berlet, shows the muchsought-after cemetery on the north side of Eagle Lake (called Wharton Lake by
members of the Wharton family). A very similar map is shown in Autobiography
OfA Spoon (Berlet 1971:75). A larger-scale drawing of the area (Figure 2), also by
Sarah W. G. Berlet, shows a sugarhouse on the shore of Bend Lake and also indicates
that the house was built in 1828. The property is owned by Restwood Memorial
Park, Inc., and since they are interested in learning the history of their property, the
Brazosport Society began its search for the cemetery with their cooperation.
During the investigation, Jay Luce, assistant manager of the cemetery, told the
authors that there was a cistern in a nearby field the cemetery had purchased for
future expansion. Excavation of the site became a major objective of the Society
since the property was to be developed in the near future, since the Brazosport
Society needed a nearby site for training Society members in archeological
techniques, and, most of all, since knowledge of nineteenth century plantations in
Brazoria County--known as the Cradle of Texas History--was almost nonexistent.
Just northeast of the large open cistern, which was found in the field, was
a low undulating mound. Upon investigation, we also discovered the remains of

an old road with ditches on both sides that passed by the site in the direction of
the old sugar mill. Large pecan trees (the largest about three feet in diameter)
were growing in the middle of this old road segment, and several large black
walnut (Juglans nigra) trees were growing beside it. Black walnut is not generally native to the area, but is occasionally found near older plantation home sites,
together with camphor trees (Cinnamomum camphora), which were often planted
by settlers. Several patches of St. Augustine grass, which thrives in rich organic
soil, were found in the field, so some of these grass areas were tested superficially with a metal detector, which revealed the presence of many metal objects.
Subsequent shovel tests proved that most of the metal objects detected were
square nails. None of these outlying areas was tested further, but it was assumed
that these areas of nails were once the sites of other buildings. The low mound
that covered the remnants of structures and the cistern have together been designated 41BO143, Site B, which was excavated by the Brazosport Archaeological Society during 1984 and 1985.
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The Eagle Island Plantation site in Brazoria County is in a hardwood forest
about 12 miles from the Gulf of Mexico (Figure 3). Most of the few sloping areas
in the site are adjacent to the Brazos River and Oyster Creek. Remnants of past
stream meanders are preserved in the many oxbow lakes in the region.
The many varieties of fauna and native flora in the area were exploited as food
sources. The major animal species found in this forest habitat today are squirrels,
deer, swamp rabbits, fur-bearing animals, and a great variety of birds. Archeological data indicate thatRangia clams, fish, alligators, turtles, birds, bison, and rodents
were the animals most often utilized by the area’s prehistoric inhabitants (Ambler
1967:69).
According to the Soil Survey Of Brazoria County (U.S. Soil Conservation
Service 1981), Brazoria County is in the West Gulf Coast subdivision of the
Atlantic and Gulf Plains geomorphic province. The subsurface sediments dip
gently gulfward and are of Holocene or Pleistocene age. The two major soils in
the former plantation are Asa silty clay loam and Pledger clay. Asa silty clay
loam is a nonsaline soil with slopes averaging about 0.3 percent, and with a surface layer of neutral, very dark grayish brown silty clay loam about 14 inches
thick. Th~ soil is well drained and is rarely flooded. Surface runoff is slow, and
permeability is moderate. Pledger clay is also a nonsaline soil with slopes averaging about 0.1 percent. This soil mainly supports pastureland, but also supports sorghum, soybeans, and corn. The Asa and Pledger soils are two of the
most productive soils in Brazoria County.
The wooded areas are typical of the lower Brazos Valley, standing in contrast
to the historically treeless coastal plain where wooded areas are generally confined
to the margins of rivers and small streams. The wooded areas are dominated by
hackberry, green ash, American elm, cedar elm, and live oak, with lesser amounts

of water oak, Shumard oak, pecan, and boxelder maple. Elm, ash, water oak, and
Shumard oak grow tall and straight, with only slightly tapering trunks, which makes
them very suitable for construction logs. A great variety of other trees, shrubs, and
vines also grow in the area, often creating dense bmsh-f’tlled, almost tropical,
woods.
It can be assumed that the first Anglo settlers chose this location because of
its rich soil, vast supply of raw materials---clay sources for brick, timber for
buildings, and plants and animals for food--and ready access to navigable
waterways that linked them to profitable markets. Under the plantation system
the county became a major producer of sugarcane and was known as the Sugar
Bowl of Texas. In the late nineteenth century, sugar production slowly decreased
while cotton production increased to twice that of any other Texas county.

HISTORICAL SUMMARY

The Eagle Island Plantation was carved from the southern five leagues
deeded in 1824 to Jared E. Groce II as part of a Mexican land grant in Stephen
F. Austin’s colony ~ay 1970). Much has been written about the wealth of J. E.
Groce, but the most important assets he brought to Texas probably were a skilled
work force and his own experience. J. E. Groce had owned a plantation in Georgia and later operated a plantation and timber holdings in Alabama (Berlet
1921:22). In 1821, while in New Orleans on business, he learned of Stephen F.
Austin’s plan to colonize Texas, and by the fall of that same year he was on his
way there with a large caravan (Berlet 1921:23-24).
"On account of his good qualities and circumstances (a notorious application
to agriculture and nearly one hundred slaves)," 10 leagues of land (comprising two
haciendas) were granted to J. E. Groce (Brazosport County Courthouse Records
[BCCR], Spanish Records [SR] 1824:244). His hacienda of five leagues on"Arroyo
Oyster" was in what is now Brazoria County, and Eagle Island Plantation was
formed from a portion of these lands. In early spring 1822, J. E. Groce chose land
on the Brazos River 4 miles south of the present town of Hempstead as the site for
construction of his northern hacienda, Bernardo (Berlet 1921:41); it was from here
that he established a cotton empire.
After finishing school in New York in 1827, Sarah Ann Groce came to join her
family in Texas. When, on December 5, 1827, at the age of 17, she married William
H. Wharton of Nashville, Tennessee, her father J. E. Groce gave the couple land in
Brazoria County as a wedding present (Berlet 1921:49; O’Connell 1959). However,
Wharton returned with his bride to Nashville, where he practiced law (Hale
1942:62) (for another version of this history, see Berlet [1921:52]), and their only
child John A. Wharton was born July 3, 1829, at the home of William Wharton’s
sister, Elizabeth Washington, near Nashville (Berlet 1921:52).
At the insistence of J. E. Groce, the couple returned to Texas in 1831 (Hale
1942:62). While crossing their land, Sarah and William came upon a grove of
large oak trees, in one of which an eagle had made her nest, so they decided to
make their home there and named it Eagle Island. The couple first lived in a log
home with an earthen floor and an enormous fireplace that occupied one entire
end of the house. J. E. Groce, who had once admired a one-and-a-half-story
mansion near Mobile, had a copy of the house precut in Alabama from native
pine and Cuban mahogany and shipped to Texas (A floor plan of the home can
be found in Autobiography of a Spoon [Berlet 1971:98]). The interior of the
home was comfortably furnished, and the grounds were well kept (Berlet
1971:15-21). A reconstruction of the plantation’s boundaries from later deeds
(see Figure 3) shows the mansion site actually south of the boundaries of the
plantation, a situation that was not unusual before the days of careful surveying.
Little is known about the day-to-day operations of the plantation, but they
were similar in several ways to the layout and operations at Bernardo, especially
since J. E. Groce had given a third of his slaves from Bernardo to his daughter.

At Bernardo, the slave quarters were about three-fourths of a mile from the main
dwelling, the cabins were built fronting a large lake, and nearby were the
overseer’s house, a large kitchen, eating hall, and day nursery (Berlet 1921:75).
Eagle Island also had many of these elements, and the overseer’s home, slave
cabins, and sugar mill were made of brick (Strobel 1926:23); cotton was probably the main cash crop.
John A. Wharton, William’s brother for whom William’s son was named, came
to stay at Eagle Island in 1833. The brothers’ participation in the Texas Revolution
and the political arena has been documented in many sources (Berlet 1917, 1921,
1971; Hale 1942; Strobel 1926); both men were vital to the formation of the
Republic of Texas. In the Wharton brothers, the Hawks of War had two very able
allies.
There was an overseer at the plantation during the time of the Texas Revolution
(Berlet 1921:57), but the authors could not find his name. However, due to the
amount of time William Wharton spent away from Eagle Island, it can be assumed
that the overseer was in charge of the plantation for much of the middle to late 1830s.
The plantation was prospering, and the home and grounds are described in the diary
Mary Austin Holley wrote during a short stay with the Whartons (Holley 1965:6063).
William H. Wharton was appointed Texas’s Minister to the United States, and
he secured U.S. recognition of the Republic of Texas on March 3, 1837, but while
he was on the New-Orleans-to-Texas leg of his return trip aboard the Texas Navy
cutter Independence, he was captured, together with the Independence, in a gun
battle that erupted when the cutter encountered the Mexican brigs-of-war Vencedor
del Alamo and Libertador, which were blockading the mouth of the Brazos River.
"Thelndependence had struck her colors almost within sight of Eagle Island, whose
fields and broad well wooded acres constituted the plantation of the captured Texas
minister" (Hill 1987:74-80). WiUiam’s brother John traveled by sea to Matamoros,
Mexico in early October, where he tried to exchange 30 Mexican soldiers captured
at San Jacinto for Wharton and other prisoners; however, when John returned to
Eagle Island late in October, he found that William had escaped and was already
home.
’File family moved to Houston in late 1838, since both Wharton and his brother
John had been elected to the Congress of the Republic of Texas. It was during his
term of office that John A. Wharton died of dysentery on December 17,1838 ~ erlet
1971:34-35). Though fast buffed in Houston, his body was returned to Eagle Island;
his burial was probably the Fast in the family cemetery (Pollan 1984:2-12).
On March 4, 1839, tragedy struck the Wharton family again when William
H. Wharton accidentally shot himself while drawing his pistol from its holster.
On March 14, 1839, when his son was nearly ten years old,William died at
Bernardo and was buried at Eagle Island next to his brother John (Berlet
1921:57-58).
After the death of her husband, Sarah Wharton spent much of her time at the
home of her brother Leonard W. Groce. Her son John was being educated there--

66

the 1840 census lists Montgomery County as her place of residence. Leonard, at his
sister Sarah’s request, changed the name of his 18-month-old son from Edwin
Waller Groce to William Wharton Groce (Berlet 1921:58), and, until he was of
school age, William Wharton Groce was allowed to spend most of his time with his
Aunt Sarah.
Like many plantations in the area, the Eagle Island Plantation probably
developed into a sugar plantation during the 1840s Clatter 1961). Family tradition
has it that William Wharton purchased two sets of machinery for the sugar mill in
order to eliminate down-time during the crucial harvest season (Strobel 1926:23).
At this time, Sarah Wharton depended upon John Harris, of Galveston, to
help her with business transactions, particularly the buying and selling of properties (BCCR, Deed D, 1844:16). Both William and John Wharton had speculated in real estate in Brazoria and Velasco. The 1840 Census (White 1966) lists
the estates of both William (title 15,498 acres, survey 61,992 acres, 41 slaves)
and John (title 1107 acres, survey 3321 acres, 2 slaves). Sarah bought and sold
several of these properties, probably in order to consolidate her holdings and to
get cash for the education of her son John.
John A. Wharton was educated with his cousins at Bernardo in Hempstead by
a Mr. Dean from New York (Berlet 1971:42). Later, John attended college in
Columbia, South Carolina, and, after graduation in 1848, read law in the office of
William C. Preston, of Columbia. There he met Penelope, the only daughter of
South Carolina Governor David Johnson, and, after their marriage, the couple
returned to Eagle Island to make their home. John continued to study law with Jack
Harris and E. M. Pease and, after receiving his license, went into partnership with
Clint Terry of Brazoria (Berlet 1971:44 A5).
Eagle Island began to prosper during the 1850s, when five acres were bought
on the Brazos River for a landing, and a right-of-way for a road to Eagle Island was
also procured (BCCR, Deed E, 1850:438). The sugar crops for the years 1852-1858
(Table 1) reflect the financial return from the land Clatter 1961:14-18).
John and Penelope Wharton had two daughters during this period: Sarah,
who died in infancy, and Kate Ross; for Christmas in 1855, Sarah Wharton gave
her infant granddaughter Kate Ross, two slaves, Carpana, age 5, and Lewana,
age 3 (BCCR, Deed G, 1855:461).
John Wharton also began to speculate in land, as had his father and uncle. He
bought several lots in Columbia, Texas, and, together with William Goodlet, he
bought the Cloman Plantation (between the present-day towns of Brazoria and Lake
Jackson) complete with slaves (BCCR Deed J, 1859:332). The slave population at
Eagle Island had risen from 76 in 1850 (U.S. Census Bureau 1850) to 132 in 1860,
housed in 30 slave houses. In the 1860 Census, John A. Wharton listed his real estate
value at $113,000 and personal wealth at $123,000 (U.S. CensusB ureau 1860). So
Eagle Island reached its zenith just before the Civil War.
Shortly after the war started, John A. Wharton joined Terry’s Texas Rangers (Graber 1987; Groce 1916:271-278). The home at Eagle Island was considered too close to the coast for safety, so John Wharton’s cousin William Wharton

Groce, now grown and a captain in the Confederate Army, returned to Texas to
move family and slaves to the Shelton Oliver home in Walker County, and bring
the family closer together (Berlet 1971:48). Shortly before the end of the war,
General John A. Wharton was shot and killed in the Fannin House in Houston
by one of his subordinates, Colonel G. Baylor, after a disagreement (Hale
1942:126-130). He was first buried at Liendo (near Hempstead), but his remains
were later moved to the State Cemetery in Austin (Berlet 1971:52).
Sarah and her daughter-in-law Penelope Wharton moved back to the main
house at Eagle Island after the war and continued the rearing of Kate Ross. As with
most families in Brazoria County, the Reconstruction Period was very harsh for the
Whartons. With no labor to work the fields, Sarah rented out the plantation from
1868 to 1870 to William Masterson for one-fourth of the sugar and cotton crops for
the contracted years. Sarah was allowed to keep the gardens close to her house but
had to pay for repairs to the sugar mill and had to provide homes for the freedmen
(BCCR, Deed L, 1867:102). These homes may be the ones shown on a map of the
county near Bend Lake in the County Deed Records (BCCR, Deed S, 1879:93).
Colonel John Harris, of Galveston, again became the family lawyer, and, being
"land poor," the family began to sell offvafious parcels of land to pay debts (Berlet
1971:53).
On August 8, 1872, after a short illness, shortly after returning from school in
Nashville, Sarah’s granddaughter Kate Ross Wharton died at Eagle Island; her
burial was the first in the new cemetery area on the near side of the lake behind the
main house (Berlet 1971:75). Penelope’s health was also failing, so Sarah asked her
nephew William W. Groce to return to Eagle Island with his family. William, his
wife Kate Wyatt, and their three children moved to Eagle Island in 1873 and took
over all the affairs of the plantation (Berlet 1971:61).

In 1875, a hurricane damaged much of nearby Velasco and Quintana and
destroyed the sugar mill at Eagle Island. (In 1984, one of thepresent authors, James
L. Smith, visited the site of the sugar mill and found it at the edge of a modem sand
pit being destroyed by the removal of topsoil and sand. The exposed stepped
foundations were well over 3 feet thick. The floor, made from half and three-quarter
bricks, was two bricks thick. A large below-ground cistern south of the building had
been destroyed; most of the material from the cistern, which contained artifacts from
the turn of the century to the 1930s and 1940s, had been used as road fill.) The strong
winds of the 1875 hurricane also destroyed half of the old tree in which the eagle
had originally made her nest (Berlet 1971:80).
Penelope Wharton died May 15, 1876 and was buried next to her daughter at
Eagle Island. Later that same year, William and Kate Groce had another daughter,
Sarah Wharton Groce, the last child born at Eagle Island (Berlet 1921:132).
On February 1, 1878, while visiting Galveston, Sarah A. Wharton died at the
age of 68, in the home of Judge John W. Harris. She willed the Eagle Island
homestead (200 acres) to William and Kate Groce (BCCR, will of Sarah Ann
Wharton, Case No. 1027, 1878). This was almost all that was left of the many
thousands of acres owned by the family before the Civil War. William W. Groce
actually had to sue the estate to get his property (BCCR, Deed S, 1879:92). The
Groce family remained at Eagle Island until 1879, when the death of their daughter
Fannie filled them with such despair that they moved to their beach house at Velasco
(Berlet 1971:69).
Most of the remaining Wharton lands were sold at sheriff’s auctions to settle
claims against the estate of Sarah Wharton or to pay back taxes, and Harris
Masterson acquired possession of the greater part of the properties (BCCR, Deeds
T, 1881:343 and U, 1882:240).
Some of these sales were ludicrous by today’s standards. For a back tax of
$3.80 state and $4.05 county, 3400 acres were bought for $12.95 (BCCR, Deed
U, 1882:240). Masterson sold most of these lands to a northern syndicate that
later subdivided the acreage into small farm tracts (Berlet 1971:73). William W.
Groce and his wife sold the homestead tract to Harris Masterson in 1884 for
$200---$100 cash and $100 payable to their children later (BCCR, Deed W,
1884:217). Several lawsuits ensued over the years, and the children sold their
portion to D. R. Pearson in 1892 for $325 (BCCR, Deed 17, 1892:177). The
house site excavated by the Brazosport Archaeological Society in 1984 and 1985
was part of a 20-acre parcel sold in 1892 to Sam B. Dolly by Harris Masterson
(BCCR, Deed 18, 1892:505).
Very little information has been recorded about the overseer at Eagle Island.
There is reference to a "Mr. Maxie, the overseer, and his wife" preparing for the
homecoming of John A. Wharton and his new bride Penelope (Berlet 1971:45). But
the 1850 Census does not list a Maxie, nor does it list John and Penelope as having
arrived at Eagle Island. However, the census does list Peter C. Eicher, aged 51, his
wife and two daughters next to Sarah A. Wharton and Dr. Branch T. Archer, who
were living at Eagle Island. Since the census lists often reflect the sequence of

Gross et al. ~ Eagle Island Plantation

69

visitation by the census taker, it is likely that the Eicher family was living in the next
house down the road from Sarah Wharton. In file 1860 Census, Peter Escher (sic)
and family, together with E. Maxey (Smith 1990) and Jno. Campbell, from
Scotland, are listed. These may be "Maxie" the overseer, and the Scottish gardener
of family tradition 03erlet 1971:79). The structure that was excavated easily could
have housed a family in one end and two bachelors in the other. After the Civil War,
William Masterson may have lived in the house, since he was overseeing the
operation of the plantation in the late 1860s. After the return of William W. Groce
and his family to Eagle Island, the house may have stood empty. An 1881 deed
(BCCR, Deed T, 1881:343) is the only document that shows a structure near the
excavation site, but none of the people interviewed who were living in the vicinity
in the early 1940s remember such a structure
The Eagle Island mansion was destroyed by the 1900 hurricane, and its residue
was used to repair other homes in the area (Berlet 1971:23). Later, the Brazoria
County Cemetery Association acquired land around the mansion site and sold its
fhst burial plot in January 1946. Most of the mansion area is now covered by
Restwood Memorial Park. In accordance with her wishes, Sarah Wharton Groce
Berlet, the daughter of William and Kate Groce, who was born in 1876, is buried
there next to her husband, in the area of the kitchen associated with the m ansion. The
old oak tree that stood beside the mansion and had housed the eagle nest for which
the plantation was named is visible today only as a huge stump cut off at the ground.
The urban areas of the towns of Lake Jackson and Clute now surround and cover the
once-proud Eagle Island Plantation.
EXCAVATIONS
The Brazosport Archaeological Society undertook extensive excavations and
subsequent analytical research at the site during the spring of 1984 and again in the
spring of 1985 (Table 2).
A datum was established northwest of the low mound near the cistern, and a
study area of 10,000 square feet was laid out in 5-foot squares. English measurement
units were chosen because the only surveying instruments available were so
equipped. Excavation units were named for the coordinates at the southwest
corners. During the two years of work at the site, 28 units were excavated, opening
up 700 square feet or 7 percent of the study area (Figure 4)
In 1984, vertical control was maintained by transit; an arbitrary elevation of 15
feet was given to the datum. Four-inch increments (plus or minus an eighth of an
inch) were dug to specific elevations (i.e., 15 feet, 14.67 feet, 14.33 feet, 14 feet).
However, lack of a transit in the 1985 season made it difficult to maintain this degree
of accuracy.
All excavated soil was put through quarter-inch screens. No fine screening was
done, nor were soil samples collected. Because of the large amount of brick rubble,
mortar, and brick fragments, all soil was removed with trowels. When sterile soil
was encountered, shovel tests insured that there were no artifacts below. All cultural

materials were collected and stored in individual bags marked with the excavation
unit from which they came.
Initially, a 2-by-20-foot trench, Trench X, was dug along the south side of the
mound (see Figure 4). When brick walls appeared, the area along the south wall of
Trench X was expanded by 8 feet, into two 8-by-10-foot units (S and U) that were
excavated independently of Trench X. Only level 5 of $6.0/E4.0 (which was below
the floor level of previously excavated Trench X) was a full 10 feet square; all other
excavation units were 5 feet square.
The site comprised three stratigraphic zones (Figure 5). Zone A, from 1 to
4 inches deep, was dark clay loam, rich with plant root, insect, and rodent disturbances. Zone B, from 4.5 to 10 inches deep, was composed of bricks, brick
rubble, and mortar in light tan sandy loam. Zone C, from 10 to 18 inches deep,
generally was thinner outside than inside the structure, with dark tan clay loam
that became more clay-like with depth. The highest concentration of artifacts, at
the interface between Zones B and C, dropped off dramatically toward the base
of the foundation (Figure 5).
CULTURAL ASSEMBLAGE
Artifacts recovered during the 1984 and 1985 excavations were classified into
nine categories (brick, brick rubble, and mortar are not included) (Table 3).

Metal Artifacts

The many metal artifacts were classified according to function into eight
groups: clothing, personal articles, table and cooking utensils, household articles,
arms and ammunition, building materials, barn and farm equipment, and tools.
Clothing (Figures 6, 7)
The variety of clothing worn on the site was evidenced by the different buckles,
buttons, and other clothes fasteners found. The metal buttons were of steel, brass,
copper, lead, and combinations of these metals; some of the military buttons were
gold plated (see below for analysis of the buttons). Several different types of ferrous
and nonferrous buckles were found; some were decorated, gold plated, or brass with
chrome, and one was a combination of brass with a steel tongue. These could have
been used with cloth or leather (Figure 6). Miscellaneous clothes fasteners include

rivets and studs; several have stars embossed on the heads, and one cufflink has a
glass insert.
Suspender hardware (Figure 6, D-F), made of brass, copper, and nickel, is
abundant, together with various other clothes fasteners, including hook-and-eye
fasteners, several of which have patent dates. Two brass loops are dated 1890
(Figure 6, G), and one loop is dated 1855. A unique suspender buckle has two
complete patent dates, March 7, 1871 and November 3, 1874 (Figure 6, H). One
interesting piece is a lady’s garter fastener.
A chrome- or nickel-plated clip attachment (Figure 6, I), embossed Anchor
and Pat Appld For is believed to be a cuff holder--a tool used to hold a cuff
to facilitate insertion of a cufflink (Figure 6, I)--since it has a spring clip on
one end and a swivel-type stud on the other (Sears Roebuck and Co. 1968:221).
Remnants of shoes and boots found are a shoe eyelet, shoe taps, and an iron
riding spur.
Personal Articles
Four coins found on the site, 1866 and 1884 five-cent pieces, an 1880 penny,
and an 1856 Liberty dime (Figure 8, A-D) provide definite evidence for the time of
occupation.
Handiwork was evidently part of the normal routine in this household, for
scissors, safety pins (Figure 8, E), sewing pins, needles, knitting needles, and

nine thimbles were found (Figure 8, F, G). Of special interest are an iron thimble,
a silver thimble, and a copper-on-brass thimble. A pressure foot for a treadletype sewing machine is evidence of later machine sewing.
Among the items of jewelry are a gold-plated brass barrette, a copper hair
clip (Figure 8, H), an ornate barrette buckle (Figure 8, I), jewelry clasp rings, a
rhinestone-encrusted pin, and a three-piece decorated bracelet (Figure 8, J).
A shaft with small brass wheels was identified as part of a child’s toy, and
a jews’ harp shows that music was heard in the house. Three pocket knives-one with a bone handle--a straight razor, and a metal hip flask all are evidence
of a variety of good living conditions for the occupants of this site. Fishing is
evidenced by four fish hooks.
The 22 ferrous and 22 nonferrous personal articles were scattered quite
evenly throughout the excavation units.
Table And Cooking Utensils
Many cast-iron fragments are apparently from a stove; two are embossed
Buck saint and Lily. Pieces of stove grating, a flue damper, and stove plates
were also found, together with cast iron handles for lifting stove plates. Many
table utensils--six forks (mostly three-tined) (Figure 9, A, B), 12 spoons, eight
knives, and miscellaneous handles--were found, and one interesting item was
what we would call a butter knife. Most of these table utensils are of ferrous
material, but several (Figure 9, C) are of silver-plated copper. Although no
cooking pots were found, a large copper sieve suggests cooking.
All except 11 of the 384 table and cooking utensils were of ferrous material
(Figure 10).
Metal Household Articles (Figures 11 and 12)
The furniture and household articles include cast-iron pieces, lamps, keys,
locks, and furniture decorations. Some cast-iron pieces, together with a socket
and a caster, could be parts of furniture such as beds or tables.
Lamp parts include a socket, wick holders, and wick-turner wheels. One of
the wick holders had a manufacturer’s name, SUNLIGHT, and patent date of
December 14, 1869; another read Patented Oct 13, 63, Reissued June 30. One
wick-turner wheel had Star embossed on the face (Figure 11, A). A small round
tin box of grease was also found, together with a keyhole plate (Figure 11, F),
four key fragments (Figure 11, E), a lock, a large padlock, and two window locks
(Figure 11, G).
The furniture fragments included drawer pulls and hasps, a small ornate
finial, a large brass bedpost top or finial for a stove, a gold-decorated knob, and
several brass knobs and caps. One of the small brass knobs was embossed PAF.
Other miscellaneous items were several brass and silver decorated pieces, a
decorated tin star, and iron, brass, and silver tubes.

Arms And Ammunition
The only firearms parts are one musket wedgeplate (Figure 13, C) and a
gunlock spring. However, extensive evidence of ammunition was found lead ball
shots, percussion caps, and cartridges. Most of the ammunition and related objects
were along the inside wall of the structure, at or below the third level. This is below
the brick rubble, which is evidence that these materials probably were inside the
house during the occupation period or at least were there before the structure was
completely destroyed.
Cap and ball ammunition indicates that pre- 1860 firearms were used. The many
lead shot balls (Figure 13, G) that were found were of calibers ranging from .22 to
A5, and also included lead and tin buckshot. Two of the lead shot had sprue still
attached, and one piece of sprue was recovered, together with a round-shot bullet
mold (Figure 13, A) and lead slag fragments, making it almost certain that shot were
manufactured at the site.

Figure 10. Diagrams showing density of ferrous and nonferrous table and cooking
utensils. Ferrous items include stove hardware and utensils; nonferrous items include
utensils.

Percussion caps for pistols and muskets were found (Figure 13, H); one musket
cap is of copper. Twelve-gauge shotshells (Figure 13, I) were in the same main areas
where the cartridges and lead shot were found. The cartridges were from a variety
of weapons (.22, .30, .32, .38, A 1, and .44 caliber), both rim- and center-fire (Figure
13, D, E), with .32 caliber predominant. Of particular note was a .44-caliber rim -fire
cartridge that had been f’tred with a dual firing pin, evidence that a Henry rifle (an
early repeating rifle) was used. Manufacture dates ~ r the cartridges range from 1860
to the present (Table 4). Primers for some of the shotshells and cartridges were
missing. Two loose-fired primers were found, together with a brass primer case
embossed HICKS CENTRAL FIRE (Figure 13, B) and a zinc cap marked
HAZARD POWDER, evidence that cartridges were being reloaded at the site. In
addition, there was an unidentified brass object stamped US (Figure 13, F), which
could be of military origin.
All except two of these artifacts (a gun part and an ammunition mold) are of
nonferrous material (Figure 14).

Building Materials
The abundance of building materials attests to the fact that a very sturdy
structure had been built. Nails were the largest category of artifacts found, as is to
be expected in a dwelling. The nails were scattered throughout the site, most
abundantly along the ends of the sla-ucture, near the two hearths and along the outside
walls. The nails are mainly the common square-cut variety, which Were available
from about 1830 until the 1890s (Hume 1970:254); they are wrought head, floor,
box, and round nails, the latter accounting for less than 2 percent of all the nails
found. One brass headless brad was also recovered. Only 25 nonferrous items of
building materials were found (Figure 15).
Spikes and rods of iron and brass were abundant, together with building studs
and brads. Washers and nuts that were used with the I-bolts, U-bolts, and a rafter bolt
were found. Wood screws, roofing tacks, and staples were used in building this
structure, and pins with eyes and parts of door hinges were recovered, together with
a copper window screen that could have belonged to the dwelling.
Barn And Farm Equipment (Figure 16)
Many common fence staples, pieces of wire, and wire hooks supplied evidence
of fanning and the use of horses or mules as beasts of burden. A few pieces of
common post-Civil-War barbed wire were also found, together with chains for
normal barn and farming activities.

Hamess rings and buckles typical of the nineteenth century, pieces of plows,
and singletree harness connectors and hooks reflect the use of horses or mules. The
artifact collection also includes a horseshoe, a horseshoe nail, and two pieces of a
bridle, including the bridle bit.
A clevis, a carriage bolt, a flat leaf spring, and a wagon hub-cover reflect the
presence of a wagon or similar equipment. A common iron shackle and other large
miscellaneous pieces with holes and hooks can also be considered barn and farm
equipment.
These artifacts may have arrived at the site when the building was used as a
storage shed or barn, just before or after partial destruction.
Tools
Tools were not abundant on the site; axeheads, hoes, a shovel, clamps, a
pulley, an auger handle, and a monkey wrench were found, but the most abundant tools are files, one of which is made of brass. All except two of the tools
are of ferrous material; all 45 tools were scattered quite evenly throughout the
excavation units.
Summary of Metal Artifacts
In summary, the dates of manufacture or use of most of the metal artifacts
were difficult to determine precisely, with the exception of the patented and
marked artifacts. The patent dates on the clothing and lamps are from 1850
through 1890. The Anchor patented article that is believed to be a cuff holder
may yield a patent date on further research.

Figure 14. Diagrana showing density of arms- and anununition-related artifacts at Eagle
Island. These items include cartridges, percussion caps, primers, shot shells, gun parts, cans,
boxes, lead and tin shot, bullets, and fragments.

The coins span the time tom 1856 through 1884, and the ammunition and
related artifacts point to occupation from pre-Civil-War days to the early 1900s.
However, the early 1900s cartridges show that we cannot eliminate the possibility
that what remained of the structures was used as an area for hunting small animals
or for target practice by local hunters
Glass Artifacts

The glass artifacts fall into three main categories--bottle glass, window
glass, and pressed or molded glass--in addition to a few fragments of mirror
glass (Table 5).
Bottle Glass
The bottles recovered from the site are of many colors (Table 6) and had
been used for beer, ale (Figure 17), wine, distilled alcoholic spirits, medicine
(Figure 18, B and C), perfume (Figure 18, A, and 19, B), hair tonic, shoe dye,
ink, and condiments (Figures 17-19). A few whole bottles were found, but most
of the whole bottles reported here were reconstructed by members of the
Brazosport Archaeological Society. Despite the the fact that they came from a

nails, screws, screening, and washers.

from a relatively undisturbed site, many bases (Table 7) and necks (Table 8)
could not be joined. Some bases have distinguishing or identifLable marks. Bottles
with both necks and bases are listed in both tables.
These bottle necks date from about 1860 to 1900¯ The necks with seams
low on the necks are early (some before 1860); necks with seams all the way up
date from about 1880. The earliest is a mason jar (they were invented in 1858),
and only one pre-1857 bottle with a pontil mark was found. These dates, together with the manufacture dates of the bases, document heavy occupation from
1860 to 1900, with indications of earlier occupation.
Pressed Glass
Pressed glass is represented only by bowl and lantern fragments; molded glass
is represented by an aqua canning jar lid, a milk-white canning jar lid, and a swan
figure (Figure 20) believed to be a perfume bottle stopper. A very unusual container
(Figure 21), recovered in pieces and partially reconstructed, stands upright on a
three-point base and is believed to be a perfume bottle or lady’s pin holder. Its
form--a wicker basket with a backstrap (a woven rucksack)--suggests that it may
have been modelled after an Indian cradle board.

Bone Artifacts
A deer antler tool handle (Figure 22, A) and a bone needle (Figure 22, B)
show signs of use. The basal three inches of the main beam of a white-tailed
deer antler used for the tool hanc!e apparently had been shed and was not removed from the skull during butchering, for it has several rodent gnaw marks
that probably were made before the antler was modified. Both the main beam
and the brow tine were sawed, two parts of the basal rosette were chipped away,
and a socket was drilled i~to the sawed end for insertion of the tool. Its shape
suggests that it was a handie for a file or rasp or similar tool, part of which can
be seen in the socket.

nails, bridles, plows, and singletrees. Nonferrous items, found in only minor quantifies, are
wire, brass, lead, copper, and tin items.

Shell Artifacts
Only a few shell artifacts, a large percentage of which are buttons (described
separately below) were found on this site; the remaining shell artifacts are motherof-pearl inlays. A few marine shells were recovered, primarily oysters, and,
considering the distance of the site from the Gulf, these shells must have been
carried to the site as food or for amusement.
Stone Artifacts
The stone artifacts recovered at the site consist primarily of slate fragments
(some of which have hatching incised as on a tally board) and slate pencils O~igure

the site; the management of a large plantation would certainly have required some
day-to-day record keeping.

The ceramics at the site were made primarily in the last half of the nineteenth
century in Bavaria, England, the United States, and possibly Mexico (Cushion

Housekeeping and Cooking Ceramics
Ceramics that were used in the preparation, serving, and storage of food are
subdivided into five types, based on paste, surface treatment, decoration, and fLring
temperature: soft paste earthenware, hard paste earthenware, yellow ware, stoneware, and porcelain.

Soft Paste Earthenware:

Undecorated Sandy Paste Earthenware is generally undecorated, unglazed
earthenware, made by Native American occupants of the area between A.D. 500 and
1800 (Aten 1971:52), with dark brown sandy paste and fire-mottled exterior
surfaces; it includes Goose Creek Plain pottery. Vessels usually are vertical-walled
jars with round or nodal bottoms.
Tin-glazed Red Paste Earthenware is characterized by a low-fired red paste
earthenware with a cream-colored tin glaze. The two sherds found on this site are
glazed only on the interiors. The larger sherd, from the bottom of a flat-bottomed
vessel, is decorated with small brown dots applied to the glaze and is unusual
because it is glazed only on the interior; it is probably of Mexican origin (Fox 1986).
Wares with this type of glaze andpaste are common in early nineteenth century sites
in the San Antonio area (Labadie et al. 1986:111).

Hard Paste Earthenwares
Luster-glazed Brown Paste Earthenware, made from a variety of pastes
(refined earthenwares, porcelain, and well-fired red bodies) and glazed by a
unique process in which various metals are added to the glaze, creating a lustrous effect. One sherd of this type was found at the site, made from a hard dark
brown paste with an interior glaze of dark brown copper luster, and an exterior
glaze of blue, brown, and tan luster stripes. Luster wares were popular in the
San Antonio area in the 1830s (Labadie et al. 1986:122) and were usually used
for pitchers and jars (Fox 1986).
Decorated White Paste Earthenwares, decorated in several different ways
(Figure 24), were imported from England in great quantities during the first half
of the nineteenth century and, to a lesser degree, in the last half (Godden 1967;
Kovel and Kovel 1986). Ten decoration categories of decorated white paste
earthenware are found in the Eagle Island collection: transfer prints, transfer

prints with enamels, hand-painted, blue edged, sponge or spatter, flown blue and
flown black, cut sponge, banded slip, decal, and undetermined edge decoration.
Transfer prints (Table 10) are seen on most of the decorated sherds. These
prints are in six colors (black, blue, brown, green, purple, and red), with
blue predominating. The patterns include florals, geometrics, and pictorials;
eleven sherds with transfer prints were identified (Figure 25), and their

distribution over the site indicates that the older patterns were generally
found inside the structure and in levels 3 to 6. The vessel forms are plates,
saucers, cups, bowls, and tureens. One fragment of a blue transfer print plate
also had part of an importer’s mark, identified as Hill and Henderson,
Importers, New Orleans.
Transfer Prints with Enamels are represented at the site by sherds with single
purple transfer patterns identified as Flotilla (Williams 1978:628), enhanced

common---over which the colored band is applied, usually on plates and
platters. Three different edge treatments were identified and roughly dated. The
first is Cockled Edge (small shell with feather motif) about 1795 to 1825
(Figure 26, H), the second is a Noncockled Edge (lightly incised trident) about
1840 to 1860 (Figure 26, I), and the last is a Noncockled Edge (no incising; shell
is brush stroked) about 1870 to 1890 (Figure 26, J). These dates are from a paper
presented by Randall Moir at the 1987 Texas Archeological Society Annual
Meeting in Waco, Texas.
Sponge or Spatter, sometimes called spatterware, consists of the application
of various colors to a vessel surface by means of an inked sponge. The colors
used in the collection are blue and red, and cups are the only vessel form
represented (Figure 26, K).
Flown Blue and Flown Black decorations consist of transfer-printed designs
in which the color has flowed out or "bled" into the surrounding undecorated
parts of the vessels. Cobalt blue sherds from saucers and plates and the black
sherds from a pitcher (Figure 26, O) are the most common in the collection.

Cut Sponge decorations, sometimes called stamped, are applied to vessels
by means of a stamp cut from a sponge and inked. Red and green geometric
stamping is found on plates and cups (Figure 26, L-N).
Banded Slip decoration is a baby-blue checkered pattern on a white background
applied to a large bowl; this decoration may date to the late nineteenth century.

Decal decorations, popular at the end of the nineteenth century, were applied
to the surfaces of vessels to keep costs down by reducing firing loss and to keep
ceramic costs down. The sample from Eagle Island has a floral decal applied
to the surface of a scallop-edged molded rim sherd enhanced with hand-painted
gold overglaze.

Unknown edge decorations, which do not fall into any of the groups described
and appear to be late nineteenth century decoration traditions, are found on
three sherds. Within a blue band at the rims are alternating white circles and
ovals. This band, on both the inside and outside of the vessel but wider on the
inside (Figure 26, D), is found on large and small plates, cup saucers, cups,
pitchers, serving dishes, bowls, and chamber pots.
Undecorated White Paste Earthenwares (Figure 27) include the undecorated
parts of decorated white paste earthenwares, pearlwares, granite wares, or ironstones. All of these white wares are combined here because they cannot be separated with any confidence into their appropriate groups. By the 1850s, the
popularity of the decorated white paste earthenwares began to wane, and by the
end of the Civil War the ironstones and granite wares became the vogue. The
collection from Eagle Island contains a few examples of the early Gothic styles
popular before the war; but most of the styles are from the last quarter of the
nineteenth century. Vessel forms are large and small plates, saucers, bowls,
platters, serving dishes, and chamber pots. Some of these sherds have makers’

marks, and, except for one American mark, all are English (Figures 28 and 29;
Table 11).
Yellow Wares are of buff clay that is finer in texture than red ware and stoneware,
to which it is very similar, except that it has more iron, kaolin, and feldspar. Yellow
wares are less dense and vitreous than stonewares, which are fired at about 2000°F;
yellow wares are fired somewhat above this temperature (GaUo 1985:38). Sherds
in the collection are either undecorated or decorated with a brown manganiferous
glaze known as Rockingham. The undecorated yellow ware sherds are from bowls
and baking dishes. One dish is an 11-inch fiat-bottomed vessel with sloping sides

called a nappie, manufactured by Sharpe Brothers and Co. ( 1838-1900) of Derbyshire,
England (Gallo 1985:11). The sherds with Rockingham glaze are from pitchers and
possibly a cuspidor. The possible cuspidor sherds are similar to those of a
Rockingham glazed yellow ware cuspidor found at Quintana, Texas (Pollan
1986:3-4).

Fourteen of the 35 yellow ware sherds were recovered from excavation unit E;
the remainder were scattered evenly throughout the site.
Stonewares (Figure 30) have hard, vitrified, clay-colored earthenware bodies.
The stoneware sherds found at Eagle Island can be subdivided into four types
based on surface treatment--salt-glazed exterior only, salt-glazed exterior with
slipped interior, slipped exterior and interior surfaces, and undetermined surface
treatments.
Salt-glazed, Exterior Only is represented at Eagle Island by two vessels. The
first, either a beer, ale, or ink bottle, has a light brown paste and a dark brown
salt-glazed exterior. The second vessel, possibly a crock or chum lid, is
represented by a single sherd of gray paste with gray salt-glazed exterior.
Salt-glazedExterior with Slippedlnterior is represented by many sherds from
crocks, jugs, and jars, with paste ranging from dark brown high-fired to light
tan low-fired. The exterior slip ranges from tan to almost black; the interiors are
all brown slipped. Most of the vessels were wheel thrown, but some were made
by the jiggered method.
Slipped Exterior and Interior Surfaces, represented by a large mixing bowl
popular in the 1890s, have dark brown slip. One and a half inches below the rim
of this vessel is a large ring flange that permitted stacking of a maximum
number of bowls for firing in the kiln (Georgiana Greer, 1987 personal
communication).
A second slipped stoneware piece has a light reddish brown wash on gray
paste, and on the interior, a light tan slip. On one of the sherds is an impressed
seal--a circle with the letters SEL around the perimeter and a crowned eagle
whose head is facing left and has the letters P.R. on its breast. A similar mark
was found on a stoneware wine bottle at the Little Campus site at The University of Texas in Austin. The mark was identified as the seal of the Duchy of
Nassau, one of the 39 independent states created by the Congress of Vienna in
1815 from lands conquered by Napoleon; they existed as political entities until
1871 (Jackson 1986:15). Munsey, however, identifies these vessels as mineral

water bottles (Munsey 1970:135), describing them as almost always with a handle
near the neck, about 12 inches tall, and holding about a quart. He dates these
bottles from 1880 to 1900 and states that
many came from Germany and Holland; one of the most common is
stamped"Nassau", which is a region in the province of Hesse in Germany.
Mineral water was imported to meet a demand by immigrants to this
country who were fond of mineral waters from the"old country" [Munsey
1970:135].
Miscellaneous sherds from undetermined vessels were also found, some with
an almost copper luster sheen on the exterior and a brown wash on the interior¯
One sherd has a white Bristol-like slip on both interior and exterior, and a creamcolored paste.
Most of the stonewares apparently were manufactured in the midwestem
United States, possibly the Ohio River valley, and date to the 1880s. All of the

stonewares were made in the last thirty years of the nineteenth century (Georgiana

Decorated Porcelain sherds in the collection are parts of four vessels. On the rim
of the t-trst vessel, a saucer, 5-1/2 inches in diameter, is a molded geometric design
with gold overglaze at the edge, below which is the faint image of a decal floral
pattern. This saucer has a maker’s mark from Zeh, Scherzer & Co., of Rehau,
Bavaria (Figure 32). The second vessel is a cup bearing the same mark. The third
decorated vessel is a cup or vase covered with an over-glaze decal composed of a
floral pattern with geometric designs and the letters o, r, g, e, t, probably part of

Personal Ceramics
Ceramics used for personal activities by the inhabitants were limited to toys,
pipes, and furniture.
Toys found on the site are marbles, doll parts, and children’s tea sets. The
marbles are unglazed stoneware, ranging between 9/16 and 1 inch in diameter. One
marble is decorated with two blue lines crossing at right angles. The doll parts-upper torso, arms, legs, and part of a face---are made of porcelain and represent at
least four dolls. The sherds of children’s tea sets--parts of a cup, a pitcher, and four
saucers ~igure 33)---are also porcelain.

Pipes were abundant and of many forms. The stem of one white kaolin pipe and a
green-glazed white kaolin Turk’s head effigy pipe are from England and were
common before the Civil War. An agate-ware pipe bowl possibly came from
England or Germany, and the remaining pipes are American. The stoneware pipes
date to the latter half of the nineteenth century. The thin dark-glazed pipes may be
from Kentucky, the salt-glazed pipes, from Pt. Pleasant, Ohio, and the light colored
pipe, bowls, and stems, from Virginia (Georgiana Greer, personal communication)
(Figure 34).

Ceramic Furniture is represented at the site by a porcelain wheel still attached
to a steel axle and swivel assembly that would have been driven into the furniture
leg. The wheel is 1-1/2 inches in diameter and 1 inch wide.
Ceramic Building Hardware is represented by two doorknobs--2 inches
in diameter and an inch thick in the center--made of dark brown stoneware paste
marbleized with different shades of brown clay. Similar doorknobs have been
found on other historic sites in Brazoria and Jackson counties (Fox et al. 1981:69;
Mallouf et al. 1973:177).
Summary of Ceramics
In summary, the ceramics indicate that the site was occupied from the late
1830s to about 1900. The early transfer patterns, together with the red-paste
wares, easily support the early date. The preponderance of undecorated white
paste earthenware with late nineteenth century makers’ marks and the lack of
early twentieth century ceramics help solidify the latter date.
Organics
Hard rubber items make up the greater part of the organic artifacts recovered.
The many novelty items hard rubber combs, pipe stem, hairpin, barrette, buttons,
and a ring (Figure 35)--reflect the desire of rubber manufacturers of the day to find
markets for their new vulcanizing process (see "Buttons," below).
Food Residues
The modest culinary tastes of the household are indicated by the many peach
pits, eggshell fragments (including one goose or turkey egg), and corn cobs.
Buttons And Studs

The six hundred fifty-nine buttons, studs, and beads recovered from the site
are broken down into six major categories: bone, shell, ceramic, hard rubber,
glass, and metal.
Bone Buttons
The large shinbones of cattle provided the best raw material for the thousands of plain two-, three-, four-, and five-hole bone buttons that were produced
in the nineteenth century. The bones were cleaned and boiled to soften them,
then sawed open and pressed fiat, and, after the spongy interiors of hollow bones
were scraped out, the button blanks were cut from the resulting slabs. Commercial bone blanks were usually cut on lathes, which imparted simple ring-turned
designs. The discs were fitted with nailhead shanks or stout pin shanks, or they
were drilled with two, three, four, or commonly five holes (four spaced evenly
and one in the middle); the center holes were drilled in the marks left by the
pricks that secured the discs in the lathes (Hughes and Lester 1981:8-13). Thirty

rainbows of colors. The shells of the pearl oyster, several species of the genera
Meleagrina or Pinctada have been most extensively used for buttons. Birmingham
was theEnglish center for the manufacture of pearl buttons well into the nineteenth
century, but the French also made beautiful pearl buttons. "Colonial" pearls, pearl
discs with conventional designs and short brass wire pin shanks, were used from the
last of the eighteenth century through the 1840s. Most of these buttons were
imported from Europe, but there is evidence that Amaja D. Goodyear, of Ohio, was

making cuffand sleeve"colonial" buttons as early as 1807. Imported shell, always
an expensive item, was cut with as little waste as possible, and after blanks had been
cut from the prime part of the shell, the smaller pieces were sold to other factories,
to be made into tiny buttons for shirts and shoes. From 1800 to 1860, most pearl
buttons were decorated with simple turned or pierced designs, often with delicate
milled edges. In the second half of the nineteenth century an American industry in
the East began to make buttons of imported ocean pearl, and by the 1890s the pearl
button industry had also developed in the Midwest, based on the abundant supply
of freshwater mussel from the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. The nacreous lining of
the freshwater mussel is almost pure white but is not iridescent. It was used mostly
for utilitarian shirts, underwear, and baby-clothes buttons (Hughes and Lester
1981:230-231). More than 17 percent of the buttons at the site were made from
shell; most were two- and four-hole utilitarian buttons (Figure 36, B, C), and only
four were of a different type--one possible "colonial" pin shanked, two oval with
swaged-in shank, and one cut design square with brass shank (possibly post-1900).
The last button here is the only one with part of the shank remaining so the other
identifications are only tentative.
Ceramic Buttons and Studs (Figure 38)
Ceramic buttons and studs for utilitarian uses comprised almost 60 percent of
the button artifacts recovered. In 1840, a process for making ceramic buttons from

dry china-clay powder was patented in England by Richard Prosser. The powder
was poured into steel dies or molds and compressed into small button shapes that
were then fired. By 1848, plain white and calico-printed buttons were being made
in the United States; from the 1850s to the early twentieth century, the greater part
of the market was dominated by the firm of Jean Felix Bapterosse, of France, who
used a process that stamped out buttons from wet china clay. Two-, three-, and fourhole plain white and colored body buttons were produced, together with calico
prints. Ceramic buttons can be classified by shape, size, pattern, body color, shank
type, finish, etc. (Hughes and Lester 1981: 31-33) (Figure 39).

Rubber Buttons
Buttons made of hardened India rubber apparently were made only in the
United States by vulcanization, which was discovered by Charles Goodyear in 1839
and patented by him in 1844¯ Nelson Goodyear patented an imProved process for
hardening rubber in 1851. The date 1851, with the designation "Goodyear’s patent"
and the manufacturer’s name, either in full or abbreviated, is the most common
backmark on hard rubber buttons made by two American companies, the Novelty
Rubber Co. of New York and New Brunswick, New Jersey, and the India Rubber
Comb Co. of New York¯ Two firms that manufactured hard rubber buttons after
Goodyear’s patents expired in the 1870s were the Dickinson Hard Rubber Co. from
the late 1870s to the early 1890s, and the American Rubber Co. in the 1880s and

1890s. Shank types include wire loop shanks, pin shanks, two- or four-hole, and a
self shank (Hughes and Lester 1981:48-56). All six rubber buttons from the site are
of the two-hole variety; three were manufactured by the Novelty Rubber Co. ~igure

Glass Buttons
Most of the glass buttons recovered from the site are black (Figure 40, E-H),
but one round button of clear glass with a wire loop shank dating from 1840 to 1890,
one round button of clear glass with impressed design top and bottom and a brass
shank from the 1860s, and three round clear glass inserts that possibly had brass
backs were also recovered. Most of the small black glass buttons with or without
pictorial designs made between 1870 and 1914 were imported from Bohemia,
Germany, and Austria until 1880, when several firms began to manufacture them
in the United States (Hughes and Lester 1981:88-109). The popularity of black
buttons during this time is attributed to the black mourning clothes worn by Queen
Victoria after the death of her husband.
Metal Buttons (Figure 41)
More than half of the 79 metal buttons are four-hole pants buttons. Some have
brass tops, but most tops are tinned iron or steel. Corrosion was quite severe on all,
but the brass buttons (Figure 40, I-J) survived sometimes in amazingly good

shape. Brass buttons can be put into several groups, including the Jacksonians of
the 1825 to 1840 period, the Golden Age gilts, military buttons, and Victorian
picture buttons. In the early years of the nineteenth century, brass buttons continued to be imported into this country from Britain, but by the 1830s, several
American manufacturers had developed the technical ability to compete with the
foreign imports. The earliest gilt buttons were one piece; by 1820, the two-piece
button had become established in Britain and was soon in~oduced into the United
States. It consisted of two stamped metal shells, front and back, folded tightly over
at the rims. Americans called it the Sanders type after the British inventor
Benjamin Sanders. Two steel dies were required to stamp the top face, a negative
and a positive die, to give more definition to the design stamped in the thin metal.
The production of these gilt buttons reached its peak in the United States between
1830 and 1850. The gilt buttons from this period are called Golden Age gilts; only
one Golden Age gilt was recovered from the site, a one-piece design with an
impressed back mark, Warranted Rich Orange (Figure 42, E). The Jacksonian
buttons, also of the Golden Age period, were small gilt brass waistcoat buttons
characterized by separate rims that were added to the one-piece bodies. More than
a hundred patterns, including die variants, have been listed. The back marks of true
Jacksonians are in raised letters, and factory marks include L. & Kendrick (18291835), R. J. & Co. (1832-1836), Scovills (1840-1850), and R. R. & Co. (18261832). Two buttons from the site could possibly be called Jacksonian; careful
cleaning of the backs of both of these would be required for positive identification.
After 1850, the quality of gilt dress buttons began to decline with lighter construction and less hand finishing, and in the 1860s, small chased gilt buttons of cheap
two-piece construction with tinned iron backs and flexible wire shank were made
for women’s wear. Victorian stamped brass picture buttons, most of which were
cheap stamped brass with lacquered steel backs, followed in the late 1860s for
ladies’ and children’s wear. Because of the steel backs, the four or five picture
buttons recovered are in bad condition; three are of the same flowered design.
Brass buttons for the military follow the same sequence in construction as the
civilian dress buttons. Both one- and two-piece buttons from the 1800 to 1840
period often have superb die work. Most were imported from Britain in the early
part of the nineteenth century, but by the 1840s, American manufacturers began to
fill the government contracts (Hughes and Lester 1981:214-224).
Four gold-gilt military buttons were recovered: one Republic of Texas Navy
button (2-piece with border and rope edging and back-marked Scovills & Co.
Waterbury) and three dating to the Civil War (Figure 42, A-D). Of these Civil War
buttons, one is a South Carolina militia button (back mark unreadable), one is a
Confederate infantry button (no back mark), and one is a Confederate cavalry button
marked Willm Bird & Co., London (Albert 1973).
Summary
After examining the buttons from the site, M. W. (Freddie) and Jean Speights,
members and officers of the National Button Society, were immediately able to

Gross et aL ~ Eagle Island Plantation

125

date the buttons roughly from the 1840s to the very early turn of the century, based
only on buttons, with no historical data. This correlates well with the other
artifacts from the site. The Speights also ascertained that the vast majority of
buttons, no matter the material of construction, were utilitarian buttons for both
men and women, used on dresses, shirts, pants, overalls, and underwear. As with

the ceramics and coins, we were able to specify rather precise dates for manufacture
of many of these buttons.
Architectural Remains
The main house foundation measures 18 by 48.5 feet, and it is estimated
that there were three rooms, with a substantial fireplace at each end. This size
and room arrangement is similar to other buildings built in Brazoria County
during the 1830s and 1840s. The foundations of this building are of massive
stepped brick construction that could easily support a two-storied structure (Nia
Becknel, personal communication) (Figure 43). A two-story or story-and-a-half
structure could easily house one large family or several small family units.
Although there is insufficient brick rubble to account for substantial brick
walls, a historical reference (Strobel 1926:23) mentions that the overseer’s home,
slave cabins, and sugar mill were of all-brick construction. Since part of the west

foundation and the west end of the south cross wall were missing, it is surmised
that the brick walls have been salvaged for use elsewhere.
Building trenches that were cut about 4 inches below the original ground
surface and extended 6 inches on each side of the f’trst brick course were found
during the 1985 excavations along the cross wall and tl~. east wall.
The red bricks used to build the house and the ciste,m were hand-made from
local subsurface clays; they measured 4-1/2 by 2 by 9 inches and were made in
molds, but no evidence of brick-making or firing was found in the area of the
structure, so it can be surmised that the bricks were made next to one of the nearby
oxbow lakes----Oyster Creek, or even the Brazos River--because of the ready access
there to raw materials.
In front of each hearth are brick-lined compartments of very poor workmanship
that were not incorporated into the original house walls. They were made of the same
kind of brick used to build the house, but incorporated many broken bricks as well;
the bricks used to build the compartments were placed on the ground about 6 inches
above the bottom brick course. We believe these compartments are small cellars
used for the storage of food, for small root cellars similarly located are common
zanong Colonial slave houses of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries
(Kelso 1984:30-31). So itcan be asked if this is evidence of occupation by a former
slave family when the plantation was share-cropped after the Civil War or if this is
a slave tradition passed down from generation to generation?
The small structure about 16 feet west of the house was built from the same kind
of brick as the house, with the addition of late nineteenth century commercial bricks;
it may be a later outbuilding such as a smokehouse.
The cistern, 10 feet from the south end of the house along its longitudinal axis,
has an inside diameter of about 14.5 feet, and a double-course brick wall, thickly
plastered on the inside with mortar that extends up and over the top of the last brick
course, about 2 inches above the ground surface. This type of construction is unlike
any other cistern seen in Brazoria County; cisterns there usually have arched brick
shoulders and narrow round chimneys that protrude well above the ground surface.
This may mean that the original roof had been removed, and the cistern was used
for some other purpose such as a stock tank. The cistern was not excavated (dirt
filled it to within 3 feet of the surface), but probing indicated its depth to be 8 to 10
feet below ground surface.
A floorboard lip that shows on a wall profile and the assumption that the stepped
brick foundation was subterrannean, all indicate that the original ground surface did
not differ much from the present. This area is not regularly subject to flooding, and
there apparently has been less than a foot of soil deposition on top of the 1900-era
artifacts.
UNMODIFIED BONES
The collection from 41BO143, Site B has more than 6,700 vertebrate animal
remains weighing about 17 kg and comprising 350 fish bones and fish scales, 10

128

Texas Archeological Society

amphibian bones, 450 reptile bones, 330 bird bones, and more than 5,600 mammal
bones (the bone counts include both fragments and whole bones). The vertebrate
remains were identified by comparison with bones in the collections of W. L.
McClure and the Houston Archeological Society.
Vertebrates
Fish (Hubbs 1982)
The gar (Atractosteus or Lepisosteus sp.) is represented by scales (2), vertebrae (2), and sculptured head bone fragments (3), but these are not sufficient
for separation of the alligator gar from other species. The channel catfish
(lctalurus punctatus) is represented by 11 bones--frontal, nasal, ceratohyal,
cleithrum, clavicle, dorsal spine, pectoral spine (2), and vertebrae (3). The bullhead (Ictalurus cf. melas) is represented by clavicle and pectoral spine (3). The
largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) is represented by 37 bones-preopercular (8), opercular (3), subopercular, interopercular, articular (2), dentary
(2), maxilla (4), premaxilla (2), basipterygium (3), cleithrum (2), vertebra (3),
pelvic spine (3), pterygiophore (2), and one other head bone, and 24 scales. The
sunfish (Lepomis sp.) is represented by 81 bones---preopercular (15), opercular
(14), subopercular, interopercular (2), dentary (2), parasphenoid, premaxilla,
supra-occipital, basipterygium, spine (18), cleithrum (14), pterygiophore (6), and
5 other head bones, and one scale.. The red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) is represented by dentary, dorsal spine, and a scale. Unidentified fish are represented
by 160 bones--vertebrae and various other fragments--and 22 scales.
Amphibians (Dixon 1987)

The collection includes 10 bones of three kinds of amphibians. The Gulf coast
toad (Bufo valliceps) is represented by sacrum, radio-ulna, ilium (3), and tibiofibula. The bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) is represented by femur and ilium. The
southern leopard frog (Rana sphenocephala) is represented by tibio-fibula (2).
Reptiles (Dixon 1987)
In the collection there are 450 reptile bones--~ne crocodilian, four kinds of
turtles, and a snake. The American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) is represented by 10 bones--mandible, articular, tooth (2), dermal bone (5), and ulna
fragment. The snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina ) is represented by 46
bones----carapace (29), plastron (4), scapula (3), radius, ulna (2), hyoid bone,
cervical vertebra, tibia (3), and fibula (2). The stinkpot (Sternotherus odoratus)
is represented by only a single left hypoplastron. A large Eastern box turtle is
represented by 9 bones---carapace (6), plastron (2), and tibia. The red-eared slider
(Trachemys scripta) is the most common turtle in the collection with 333 bones-carapace (200), plastron (40), dentary (3), scapula (16), humerus (16), radius
(3), ulna (3), cervical vertebra, coracoid (13), ischium (3), ilium (7), pubis (5),

femur (10), tibia (4), and fibula (15). The only snake bone in the collection is a
midbody vertebra of a rat snake (Elaphe obsoleta).
Birds (Terres 1980)

The collection comprises 330 bones of at least 14 kinds of birds; 125 bones
are of water birds and include the upper and lower beaks of the double-crested
cormorant. The many species of ducks and geese that pass through Brazoria
County make it impossible to identify all the bones of the waterfowl, but comparisons with bones of known birds allow tentative identification. If some of the
bones attributed to the following waterfowl are not of the species named, they
are of a closely related species of the same size. Two bones that match the Canada
goose (Branta canadensis) are ulna and phalanx No. 1 of digit 2 of the wing.
Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) is represented by 62 bones--mandible (3), articular, skull fragment, synsacrum, humerus (6), radius (4), ulna (3), scapula (5),
coracoid (8), carpometacarpus (6), phalanx No. 1 of digit 2 of wing, phalanx
No. 2 of digit 1 of wing, furculum (3), sternum fragment (5), rib, tibiotarsus (8),
and tarsometatarsus (5).
Twenty-one bones closely match the American wigeon (Anas americana):
articular, cervical vertebra, coracoid (2), humerus (5), ulna (4), carpometacarpus
(4), furculum, sternum fragment (2), femur, and tibiotarsus. Five bones match
the northern shoveler (Anas clypteata): coracoid (2), scapula, humerus, and
carpometacarpus. Thirty-one bones match the teal (Anas discors or crecca):
mandible, coracoid (5), humerus (10), radius (3), ulna, carpometacarpus (5),
furculum, rib, and tibiotarsus (4). Two ulnae are probably of the ruddy duck
(Oxyura jamaicensis).
The two domestic birds in the collection are turkey (Meleagris gallopavo),
with 16 bones: cervical vertebra, radius, ulna (4), carpometacarpus, coracoid,
femur, tibiotarsus, tarsometatarsus (3), and phalanx (3), and domestic chicken
(Gallus domesticus), with 135 bones: skull, dentary (2), vertebra (13), synsacrnm
(3), scapula (13), humerus (10), radius (8), ulna (8), carpometacarpus (8), cuneiform, phalanx No. 1 of digit 2 of wing, phalanx No. 2 of digit 2 of wing (2),
rib (3), tibiotarsus (11), coracoid (16), ischium, sternum, femur (7), tarsometatarsus (15), fibula (3), and phalanx of foot (9). The red-tailed hawk (Buteo
jamaicensis) is represented by the coracoid and synsacrnm.
Two game birds are in the collection. The bobwhite (Colinus virginianus)
is represented by only a humerus. The mourning dove (Zenaida macroura) bones
are coracoid (2), sternum, carpometacarpus, femur, and tarsometatarsus. There
are two perching birds in the collection. The mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos)
is represented by femur and tibiotarsus. The blue jay (Cyanocitta cristata) is
represented by humerus, ulna (4), and carpometacarpus. A total of 36 bird bones
were not identified as to species. These are vertebra (5), scapula (2), humerus
(3), carpometacarpus (4), phalanx No. 1 of digit 2 of wing (2), phalanx No. 2 of
digit 2 of wing, coracoid (2), sternum, synsacrnm, tibiotarsus (2), tarsometatarsus (7), and fragments (6).

130 Texas Archeological Society
Mammals (Schmidly 1983)

A total of 5614 bones of 18 species of mammal was recovered. The Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana) is represented by 96 bones: maxilla, premaxilla, other skull fragments (8), mandible (7), loose teeth (6), vertebra (17),
scapula (8), humerus (15), radius, ulna (10), innominate (2), femur (6), rib, and
metacarpal. Three leporids are represented in the collection. The 38 eastern
cottontail (Sylvilagusfloridanus) bones are mandible (3), vertebra (3), scapula

long bone fragment (2), and phalanx (22). In the collection are also 4,546 fragments
of mammal bones that are too fragmentary to assign to species.
Vertebrate Discussion
The excavations yielded remains of at least 47 species of vertebrates--6 of
fish, 3 of amphibians, 6 of reptiles, 14 of birds, and 18 of mammals. Although
most of these animals are technically edible, 16 are not believed to have been
eaten by the people who inhabited the site. Twenty-seven different species of
wild, nondomestic vertebrates apparently were eaten, and, in addition, four varieties of domesticated animals were a major part of the food resources of the
people.
Nonfood Vertebrates:
The 16 animals included in this category are Gulf Coast toad, southern leopard frog, stinkpot, rat snake, double-crested cormorant, red-tailed hawk, blue
jay, mockingbird, Louisiana pocket gopher, hispid cotton rat, eastern woodrat,
roof rat, Norway rat, long-tailed weasel, domestic dog, and domestic cat. The
toad, frog, stinkpot, and snake may have been killed by the inhabitants but it is
probable that some were inadvertent inclusions in the deposits. Cormorants
(Phalacrocorax auritus) may have been shot, but their flesh is so oily and fishy
that the people probably would not have eaten it, and hawks may have been
shot as potential raiders of the chicken yards. The people apparently kept a few
cats and dogs; the cats may have been responsible for the bones of small birds
and small rodents in the soil. However, the quantities and distribution of the
bones of the gophers and rats strongly indicate that owls or other raptors were
responsible. Weasels were probably killed for their fur.
Food Source Nondomestic Vertebrates:
The 27 animals included in this category are gar, channel catfish, bullhead,
largemouth bass, sunfish, red drum, bullfrog, American alligator, snapping turtle,

Food Source Domestic Vertebrates:
The four animals in this category are turkey, chicken, pig, and cow. The
turkeys may have been wild and the pigs too, but all were probably domestic
animals under the control of the inhabitants or their neighbors.

Summary of Vertebrates

All the wild varieties of animals in the collection are common elements of the
local fauna; the water birds are seasonal. The imported roof rat and Norway rat were
apparently well established at the time of the deposits. All of the fish could have been
caught in the nearby Brazos River or Oyster Creek and, except for the red drum, they
could have come from the small lakes that are even closer. The red drum may have
been caught at the coast, only a few miles from the site. This fish and a few fragments
of marine arthropods, echinoderms, and mollusks are the only indications that the
people at Eagle Island visited the beach. The alligator, bullfrog, and water turtles
could have been acquired at the local lakes, fiver, or creek. The goose, bobwhite,
dove, box turtle, deer, and small mammals would have been available in the nearby
wooded areas or the fields between them. The opossum, raccoon, and weasel may
have been trapped for the fur trade as well as for food. The people or their neighbors
were either raising turkeys, chickens, pigs, and cattle, or they acquired these species
from a market. All four varieties of domestic animals were butchered on the
premises from whole, live individuals.
The people were both harvesting locally available fish, frogs, turtles, alligators, birds, and mammals and relying on the four domestic animals. They kept
a few cats and dogs, the latter, perhaps, for assistance in hunting. The smaller
birds and mammals were preyed upon by raptors that probably roosted on the
houses. The vast amount of bone material recovered inside the house, the high
percentage of fragmentary material, and the fact that many of the bones were
burned all suggest that the house was used as a dumping site in its later years.
CONCLUSIONS

We believe the construction of the brick house and cistern most probably
dates to the 1840s, but not before the late 1830s, in part because of the substantial nature and type of brick construction and in part because of the earliest dated
artifacts recovered. The small brick foundation west of the house was probably
built, or at least repaired, after the Civil War. The fact that the structure was
near the roads to the river landing, the sugar mill, and the slave quarters (see
Figure 2) indicates that it was the overseer’s home, which was usually a center
for the business transactions of a working plantation. We have been unable to
locate evidence of the brick slave cabins, which, according to the hand-drawn
map (Figure 1) are down the road leading northeastward toward the sugar mill
and Bend Lake. In the 1840s, both William H. and John Wharton had died, and
William’s son John was still a boy, often at school elsewhere, so there would
have been no family man to run the plantation. The artifact assemblage indicates residential occupation by a working-class family. The structure appears to
have been occupied continuously from the 1840s toward 1900, with the preponderance of artifacts dating late in this period, indicating that one or a succession
of middle-class farm families, perhaps with the names of Maxie (or Maxey),

Eicher, Masterson, or Dolly may have lived in the house or in the area. At some
time after occupation ceased, the brick walls and part of the foundation were
salvaged for other uses.
The density of artifacts in soil zone B inside the walls suggests that the house
went into disuse sometime after 1875 and was used thereafter, but no later than
1900, as a dumping site. The large number of household items (metal, buttons,
etc.) indicates that the house may have collapsed on a large portion of the interior furnishings during one of the major hurricanes that hit the area in 1875,
1886, or 1900. Salvage of the wrecked structure would have left a major share
of the contents of the house as a pile of rubble that was then a likely spot for a
dump. In fact, some of the dumping could be a one-time episode associated with
cleanup of the area after the same storm that caused the collapse. The large
amount of bone material further supports the dumping hypothesis, since few
people would dump such a quantity of food refuse inside their homes. Since
more than 150 bones of five small rodent species were concentrated along the
north cross-wall, there may have been an owl roost atop this wall after human
occupation ended, but while the walls still stood. So human occupation may have
ended (perhaps due to only partial destruction in a hurricane or abandonment
due to the poor financial condition of the owners during Reconstruction) before
total destruction of the walls, again making this a likely spot for dumping or for
salvaging bricks. In any event, the artifacts indicate that there was no significant use of the site after 1900, and all above-ground evidence of the structure
had gone by the early 1940s, since 1940s residents (interviewed in 1984) who
were aware of the cistern there, recall no structure in the area.
This site was unusual in the great quantity and high quality of the artifacts
collected. Only about a third of the interior of the house, and only 7 percent of the
overall study area, was excavated, yet the volume of artifacts strained our capacities
to catalog, analyze, and store them. Questions that remain to be answered are the
function of the small outbuilding west of the house, the location of the kitchen, and
the function of other outbuilding sites discovered during the initial survey.
Additional excavations were carried out in 1989, but the results of that work are
not included in this report. Artifacts and field notes from the 1989 investigation are
stored together with the materials from 1984 and 1985 at the Brazosport Museum
of Natural Science.
