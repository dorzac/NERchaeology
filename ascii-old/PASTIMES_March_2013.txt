Preserving and Protecting the Washita
Battlefield National Historic Site
The Washita Battlefield National Historic Site protects and interprets the setting along
the Washita River where Lt. Col. George A. Custer led the 7th U.S. Cavalry on a surprise dawn
attack against the Southern Cheyenne village of Peace Chief Black Kettle on November 27,
1868. The attack was an important event in the tragic clash of cultures of the Indian Wars era.
This presentation examines the Washita Battle and the ongoing role of the National Park Service in preserving and interpreting this event.
Kathryn A. Harrison and Dick Zahm will present this topic at the Panhandle Archaeological Society meeting Wednesday, March 20, at 7 PM at the Wildcat Bluff Nature Center,
2301 N. Soncy, Amarillo, Texas.
Biographies:
Kathryn A. Harrison
Kathryn has had an eclectic career, having been a high school history teacher in Brownsville,
Texas, a Foreign Service Officer with the U.S. Department of State, and a Peace Corp Volunteer in Barlinek, Poland. But, she loves the National Park Service best having served at Mesa Verde National Park,
San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park and
Jean Lafitte National Park and Preserve. She’s been at
the Washita Battlefield National Historic Site in Cheyenne, Oklahoma since December 2008 and is the park’s
Education Coordinator.
Dick Zahm
Dick began his career with the National Park Service in June of 2002 at the Pea Ridge National Military
Park. He came to the Washita in 2004 and has assumed
the role of Natural Resources Manager as he has developed strong partnerships with the Southern Plains Network, the Great Plains Trail, and the Nature Conservancy. Dick is the park’s ADA coordinator and the
COTR for a multitude of park projects from the building
of the new visitor center, to the creation of the park’s Native Garden – a partnership he developed with the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribe.

A Palmillas Dart Point Embedded in a Bison
Vertebra from an Unknown Site
By Christopher Lintz, Cultural Resource Specialist, Wildlife Division, TPWD
Over the past decade, I have volunteered as an archaeological specialist for the biannual public Identification Day held by the Texas Memorial Museum at the University of Texas. This event enhances public awareness, and is structured like the Antiques Roadshow, except the specialists do not discuss price values of the
public’s materials. Typically the “experts” include specialists in identifying rocks, minerals, fossils, bones,
snakes, and artifacts. The event is also similar to television program “Pawn Stars” for “you never know what
will walk through those doors.”
This past December, one of the more memorable items brought for identification was a dart point firmly
embedded in the neural arch of a bison vertebra (Figure 1). The owner, Mr. Dan Hutton of Georgetown, said
that he purchased the specimen from a curio shop in Fredericksburg sometime between 1980 and 1982. He
recalled that the shop owner said that the item was acquired from a “local rancher”. But after more than 30
years, it is very unlikely that anyone would be able to trace the specimen back to a specific archaeological site.
Mr. Hutton was interested in knowing whether his purchase was the real thing, or something fabricated and
foisted on unsuspecting buyers. The importance of this unprovenienced artifact rendering it worthy of this
note and the recovery of such a specimen is not only rare and interesting, but it also provides some insights
into game procurement practices.
The bone element is the first thoracic vertebra, which is the spinal bone below the neck and immediately in
front of the hump. The point is embedded in the middle of the neural arch at about a 60 o angle from the horizontal plane on the left side. The point is held fast in the bone and a substance, possibly calcium carbonates, is
at the contact between the bone and the point on the exterior. The point penetrates through the neural arch to a
depth of about 1.47 cm (88 %) into the spinal cord opening. A small bone splinter is adhering to the inside of
the neural arch.
The projectile point is classified as a Palmillas dart point (Turner, Hester and McReynolds 2011: 145). The
point is a moderately large and relatively thick corner notched dart head with slight shoulder barbs, relatively
wide and deep corner notched, a markedly expanding stem, pointed-to-angular basal tangs, and a convex base.
The dimensions of the dart head are provided in Table 1. All dimensions were measured using spreading calipers; however, the specimen length is approximated, since the bone prevented accurate measurement of the
specimen.

A Palmillas Dart Point ...Continued from Page 4
The dart point is made of a dark gray/very dark gray (10YR 3.5/1) coarse chert or fine quartzite with mottles of light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) mottles and very tiny white specks throughout. The precise kind of
chert used to make the point is uncertain; the colors are within the range of variation of Edwards Cherts, but
the color and texture are not common for this central Texas chert. The texture and some color aspects may
also be within the range of variation of Potter chert/quartzite found within the Texas panhandle and the dissected Redbed Plains to the east.
The association of Palmillas style dart points with bison kills is relatively well known for bison kill sites the
Rolling Redbed Plains, especially in the southeastern corner of the Texas Panhandle between the Pease River
and the Salt Fork of the Red River. The series of sites includes Twilla, Collier, Strong, Doc Bell, Hoover,
Finch, Sitter, RO Ranch, and Buzzard Roost (Tunnell and Hughes 1955; Hughes 1977, 1989; Lintz et al.
1991). A series of seven radiocarbon dates on bison bone collagen from these kill/camp sites range from 2,335
+ 100. B.P (380 + 100 B.C. 13C/12C fractionation corrected, Beta-1927) to 980 + 100 B.P. (A.D. 970 + 100,
not corrected for 13C/12C fractionation, RL-572). Most dates from these kill sites overlaps the range of bow
and arrow use for the southern Plains area, and suggests that atlatl and dart points persisted in use after the appearance of the bow/arrow technology; especially in the hunting of larger herbivores. Perhaps the technology
was used by people from the Lake Creek (Plains Woodland) or the Palo Duro complexes.

A Palmillas Dart Point ...Continued from Page 5
One interesting aspect of these Transitional Archaic and Late Prehistoric I period bison kills in the lower
panhandle is that most are found near the constricted heads of arroyo gullies. The setting suggests that the
hunting tactic involved driving small herds of bison into the mouths of arroyo and when the animals were constrained by the topography inside the incised gully, the hunters would dispatch the herd.
In this regard, the 60o angle of the spear head in the neural arch in the present specimen strongly suggests
that the dart was thrown from an elevation above the animal, similar to that expected in an arroyo kill situation.
The occurrence of the dart head in the first thoracic vertebra suggests that the hunter was probably trying to hit
the lungs, or other vital organs in the upper chest. That about 2 cm of the chert point base sticks above the outside of the neural arch, perhaps reflects the presence of a wooden foreshaft wider than the dart head that
stopped the projectile’s penetration when the wooden foreshaft hit the bone. The 1.47 cm penetration into the
spinal cord might not have inflicted the fatal blow, but the wound would have probably immobilized the bison
and sealed this animal’s fate.
In summary, the style of point embedded in the bison vertebra is similar to comparable points found in
other bison kill sites. The presence of calcium carbonate crust on the outside helps solidify the bone and point
together and is probably derived from soil formation processes. The presence of a small interior splinter of
bone strongly suggests that the specimen is a genuine archeological specimen and not fabricated for the tourist
trade. While it is unfortunate that the location of the kill site remains surrounded in mystery, the recovery of
this specimen is a rare occurrence, and provides some insights into bison hunting and procurement strategies.

February PAS Speaker Ken Weidner Presented the
History and Evolution of German Silver and Silver
Ornaments used by Southern Plains Tribes
This presentation examined the history and evolution of the use of Silver and German Silver ornaments
used by the Southern Plains tribes. It used primary sources, historic invoices, museum examples, and
actual silver artifacts recovered from archaeological contexts. The principle focus was on the pre-1874
period ornaments, not the later, more elaborate
silver, which flourished during the later reservation era. Early trade in sheet German Silver,
tools used in metalworking, and the decorative
techniques used were discussed.
