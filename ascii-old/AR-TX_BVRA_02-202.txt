ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of a proposed 12.39-mile water line in southcentral Brown County, Texas was performed on May 4, 2008 by Brazos Valley
Research Associates (BVRA) for the Brookesmith Special Utility District (SUD)
under Antiquities Permit 4904. Two areas were examined. Area A is a 3.83-mile
segment north of Lake Brownwood that does not cross any creeks, and Area B is
an 8.56-mile segment south of the city of Brownwood that crosses one creek. No
archaeological sites were found in either of the two areas, and it is recommended
that construction of the water line be allowed to proceed as planned. In all, the
project area comprises 22.53 acres. No artifacts were collected. Copies of the
report are on file at the Texas Historical Commission (THC), Archeology Division,
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), and BVRA.

INTRODUCTION
The Brookesmith SUD plans to install 12.39 miles of three-inch and sixinch water line along Farm-to-Market Road 45 and several county roads in rural
Brown County, Texas (Figure 1). The purpose of this project is to provide
potable water to residents of Brown County who do not currently have water
service. Groundwater is the only alternative to the proposed project, and the
existing groundwater supply is unreliable. When available, it is of very poor
quality. This project is being funded by the Texas Water Development Board
(TWDB). The water line will be placed in a trench with three feet of cover and
between six and twelve inches wide depending on pipe size and the availability
of trenching machines. The construction easement will be fifteen feet wide. The
majority of the water line will within the existing highway rights-of-way, and the
rest will be on private property. No structures will be constructed within the 100year floodplain. All water distribution lines within any floodplain will be installed
underground in order to not hinder the flow of storm water or impede surface
drainage anywhere along the route of the proposed water line. Following
construction, there will be no direct or indirect impacts to prime farmland, and
there will be no direct or indirect adverse impacts to hydrological elements due to
this project. No habitat for threatened and endangered species is known to occur
in the project area. If such habitat is identified, direct impacts will be mitigated by
realignment of the project or by restriction of construction activities near such
habitat to the non-breeding, non-nesting season of the year. Indirect impacts to
such habitat are likely to be the result of subsurface location of the water line.
Erosion will be controlled by compaction of trench backfill, locating excess
excavation away from wetlands and floodplains, and utilizing silt control. The
project area is depicted on two USGS topographic quadrangles. They are Byrds
(3199-444) (Figure 2) and Indian Creek (3198-322) (Figure 3). In a letter to
Environmental Coordinator, Justin Helms of Jacob & Martin, Ltd. it was
recommended by the THC that a cultural resources survey be performed by a
professional archaeologist prior to the installation of the water line in all high
probability areas. In order to comply with this request, the Brookesmith SUD
retained BVRA of Bryan, Texas to conduct this investigation. The photograph on
the cover is an older structure outside the project area.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Brown County is an area of rolling hills and varied soils that drains to the
Colorado River to the south that forms the southern boundary of Brown County.
According to Clower (1980:1), the pattern of soils in Brown and Mills counties is
complex. He states that four major geologic formations have influenced the
nature of the soils. In Brown County and adjacent Mills County three major land
resource areas converge. In the eastern part of the area, are the soils of the
Grand Prairie; in the western part of the area are soils of the Texas North Central
Prairies, and in the northern part of the area are soils of the West Cross Timbers.
The soils of the Grand Prairie and Texas North Central Prairies formed mainly
under grass vegetation and are dominantly dark colored and loamy and clayey.
The soils of the West Cross Timbers formed under post oak savannah and are
dominantly light colored and sandy and loamy. In both areas surveyed, the soils
are described by Clower (1980:General Soil Map for Brown County) as very
shallow to deep loamy and clayey soils on uplands. In Area A, the soils are
described as âgently sloping to hilly, moderately deep to deep, stony loamy soils
over sandstone or shale.â In Area B, the soils are described as âgently sloping to
hilly, shallow to moderately deep, gravelly loamy soils over limestone.â In the
one high probability area where the water line will cross Rough Creek, the soils
are depicted on Sheet 61 in the soil survey and described by Clower (1980:28)
as Frio silty clay loam, frequently flooded. This is a nearly level soil on flood
plains along small streams. This soil type floods once or twice a year and is
loamy. The dominant vegetation in the county is mesquite and buffalo grass
although live oaks and red oaks are commonly found on the slopes and in the
rocky uplands. According to Blair (1950), the project area is located within the
Balconian Biotic Province.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Brown County is located in the North Central Texas Cultural-Geographical
Region of Texas as defined by Biesaart et al. (1985) in a planning document
published by the Texas Historical Commission. Brown County, with 2678
recorded sites in 1985, was second in a region that consists of 39 counties. Of
the 95 recorded sites in Brown County in 1985, 2 are Paleo-Indian, 1 is Late
Archaic, 32 are General Archaic, and 2 are Late Prehistoric. Disturbance to sites
in the county is listed by Biesaart et al. (1985:184) as erosion (n=95),
construction (n=6), dispersed (n=25), vandalized (n=2), and destroyed (n=1).
Investigation at sites in the county in 1985 consisted of excavated (n=1), tested
by hand (n=3), tested by machine (n=2), and surface collected (n=65). Brown
County was ninth in the region in terms of the number of sites recorded in 1985.
At the time of this survey there were over 550 recorded prehistoric and historic
sites in the county, and the only six sites listed in the in the National Register of
Historic Places are in the city limits of Brownwood. Only one site has been
documented as a State Archeological Landmark. This is the Brown County Jail,
also in the city limits of Brownwood.
The earliest professional activity in Brown County occurred in 1919 when
Professor J. E. Pearce of The University of Texas at Austin trenched two burned
rock middens at the Pittman Farm site (41BR3) on Willis Creek, a tributary of
Pecan Bayou (Campbell 1952). No artifacts were found in either trench, and
Pearce concluded that the middens represent debris discarded from a central
hearth area. Other early work in the county was conducted by Cyrus N. Ray in
the 1930s. Ray (1933) examined a burial that was being destroyed by road
construction. In 1960, a guide to the literature of Texas archeology was
published by Thomas N. Campbell (1960) in the Bulletin of the Texas
Archeological Society. In this volume, only seven references to Brown County
were included. The first series of modern era professional investigations in the
county were carried out by archaeologists from Texas A&M University. Most of
these projects were in areas along Pecan Bayou (Shafer 1975; Shafer et al.
1975a, 1975b; 1976). These studies found a variety of sites that include lithic
scatters, burned rock middens, lithic quarries or procurement areas, rock
shelters, and habitation sites. Based on this work, they concluded that
prehistoric occupation was concentrated along the major streams, and the upper
reaches of tributaries were utilized on an occasional or intermittent basis. Many
of the archaeological sites in Brown County were recorded in the 1970s by locals
along Turkey Creek and Red River and scattered about the landscape in the
northern part of Brown County. The kinds of sites identified were mainly lithic
scatters and burned rock middens. In 1979 and 1980, two field schools were
sponsored by the Texas Archeological Society on the Eubank Ranch on Pecan
Bayou and some of its tributaries under the direction of Gerald Humphreys. The
kinds of prehistoric sites found include ring middens, mound middens, a rock
shelter, campsite, lithic scatter, and burial site. Historic sites include houses, a
mill, and wagon road.

At this time there is no final report documenting the results of the two field
schools. Information can be found in articles and manuscripts by Humphreys
(1979, 1980), Teak and Eck (1979), and Hoffrichter and Davis (1981).
A portion of the project area is along Farm-to-Market Road 45. In 1991,
archaeologists from the State Department of Highways and Public Transportation
(now Texas Department of Transportation [TxDOT]) examined this road and
found no sites. A report is on file at TxDOT (1991).
Some of the more recent investigations have been conducted at Lake
Brownwood State Park (Anthony and Brown 2000) and throughout the county for
projects created by the Brookesmith SUD (Henderson 1999; Skinner 2000, 2002,
2005). These studies were located in upland settings, and few sites were found.
Henderson (1999:2) attributes the lack of prehistoric sites in her project area to
the upland setting and previous disturbance.

METHODS
Prior to entering the field the Archeological Site Atlas was checked for
previously recorded sites and past surveys in the area. Three important reports
were reviewed during the planning stages of this project. These are a planning
document published by the Texas Historical Commission (Biesaart et al. 1985), a
planning document published by the Department of Antiquities Protection (now
Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division) (Kenmotsu and Perttula
1993), and a report by S. Alan Skinner (2005) documenting work in the general
area. The interested reader is referred to these sources for additional information
regarding the prehistory of this area. The field investigation was conducted on
May 4, 2008 by the Principal Investigator. The first area visited was Area A,
which consists of 3.83 miles of proposed water line along two county roads
(County Road 117 and County Road 118). The water line will be placed on the
west side of the roads across the fence on private property. The entire area was
driven and occasional stops were made to inspect the ground surface for
evidence of a prehistoric site. Surface visibility was excellent. The road cut
revealed a shallow soil overlying rock in most places. Therefore, shovel testing
was not conducted. The second area visited was Area B, which consists of 8.56
miles of proposed water line along Farm-to-Marked Road 45, county roads 236,
239, and 265. The water line will be placed on the east side of Farm-to-Market
Road 45 and County Road 265 and on the south side of county roads 236 and
239. The section along County Road 239 will be placed on private property. The
entire area was driven with occasional stops to inspect the ground surface for
evidence of a prehistoric site. No chert nodules or burned rock were observed,
and the soil appeared to be shallow. Therefore, no shovel tests were excavated.
One area of interest was encountered. This was a series of three bridges
crossing the upper reaches of a tributary of Rough Creek with old guardrails
made of cement. These bridges were photographed (Appendix I), but they were
not recorded as a historic site.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The records check at TARL revealed that no professional investigations
have been conducted in the project area, and no archaeological sites are known
to exist within either of the two areas investigated during this study. No evidence
of prehistoric occupation was found in either area. In Area A, there are no major
stream crossings. The entire area is within an upland setting that is relatively
level with higher elevations in the distance. Area A is an upland divide between
two major drainages. They are Pecan Bayou to the west and Hog Creek to the
east. It is along these watercourses that many of the prehistoric sites in Brown
County have been identified. The soils throughout Area A are shallow and rocky.
No exposed chert cobbles were observed in this area, which is viewed as a very
low probability area for a significant prehistoric site. Any site in Area A would
undoubtedly be restricted to the surface. Virtually the entire 3.83-mile segment
was disturbed through road construction or scraping within the fence line,
probably by the landowner as a firebreak. This disturbance would destroy the
context of any site within these areas. Figure 4 illustrates the degree of
disturbance in Area A that is typical of the entire segment. Area B contains one
high probability area â the crossing of the water line at Rough Creek. This 8.56mile segment follows Farm-to-Market Road 45 that was examined in 1991 by
archaeologists from the Texas Department of Transportation (1991) and county
roads 236, 239, 264, and 265. The area most likely to contain an archaeological
site is the segment along County Road 239. Here, part of the water line passes
through a divide flanked on both sides by steep hills. The soil is rocky, but no
chert nodules or burned rock were observed. The soil at Rough Creek floods
frequently so it is not a likely setting for a permanent campsite. Also, the area
where the water line crosses the creek is actually the upper reaches of a tributary
of the main channel of Rough Creek. A review of past work in the county by
archaeologists from Texas A&M University (Baxter and Shafer 1975; Shafer
1975; Shafer et al. 1975a, 1975b; Shafer et al. 1976) determined that the upper
reaches of tributaries were utilized on an occasional or intermittent basis. Figure
5 depicts a typical view of the right-of-way along Area B where the water line will
be installed, and Figure 6 illustrates the rocky soils encountered on the surface in
Area B. Historic sites can appear virtually anywhere on the landscape. Three
bridges were observed at the crossing of Rough Creek and two low-lying areas
that flood regularly. The age of these bridges is not known, but BVRA believes
that they were probably constructed during the early part of the 20th century when
the county road was built or improved. The three bridges are depicted in
Appendix I.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No archaeological sites were found during the archaeological survey for the
Brookesmith SUD. The three historic bridges represent events associated with the
construction of County Road 329, but they are not considered worthy of being
protected. It is, therefore, recommended that construction be allowed to proceed
as planned without further consultation with the THC. Should the construction
plans change to include a greater area that can be viewed as a likely setting for a
prehistoric site, the THC must be notified in case additional survey by a
professional archaeologist is warranted. Also, if cultural materials are unearthed
during construction, all work in the area of the find must stop until the THC can
evaluate the situation. This study conformed to the Minimum Survey Standards as
defined by the Archaeology Division of the THC.
