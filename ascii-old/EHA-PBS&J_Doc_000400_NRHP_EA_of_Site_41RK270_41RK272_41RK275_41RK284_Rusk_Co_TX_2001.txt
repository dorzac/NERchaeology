ABSTRACT
During October 2000, PBS&J was contracted by TXU Business services to conduct National
Register of Historic Places Eligibility testing on four prehistoric sites: 41RK270, 41RK272, 41RK275, and
41RK284. All of these sites were located within TXU Mining Company's Oak Hill Diil Mine, Permit 46,
in Rusk County, Texas. Archaeological investigation revealed that none was likely to contain data resources
significant to understanding regional prehistory and are therefore not considered eligible for inclusion into
the National Register of Historic Places.

I. INTRODUCTION
At the request of TXU Business Services, PBS&J initiated National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) eligibility testing excavations at prehistoric sites 41RK270, 41RK272, 41RK275, and 41RK284 in
TXU Mining Company's Oak Hill DIII, Permit 46 Mine (Mine), in Rusk County, Texas (figures 1and2).
Sites 41RK270. 41RK272, 41RK275, and 41RK284 were recorded during a cultural resources survey of the
permit area (Skokan et al. 1997a,b).
The research design for the current investigations was developed in consultation with the
Texas Historical Commission (THC) and was approved in a letter dated September 21, 2000 (Martin 2000).
These investigations were performed in compliance with the Protection of Historic Properties
regulations (36 CFR 800), which govern the Section 106 review process as established by the National
Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (PL 89-665), as amended in 1974, 1976, 1980, and 1992; the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL 91-190, 83 Stat. 915, 42 USC 4231, 1970); the Office of Surface
Mining Regulations, as superseded by the Coal Mining Regulations of the Texas Railroad Commission,
1981, as updated in 1989; the 1982 Memorandum of Agreement for the Oak Hill (Martin Lake D) Mine;
and other appropriate cultural resources legislation and the guidelines set forth by the Council of Texas
Archeologists and the Register of Professional Archaeologists.
The Principal Investigator and primary report author for this project was David L. Sherman,
who directed all fieldwork. Additional field personnel included Michael Chavez, Eric Morley, and Craig
Weaver. Lab work was conducted by Rebecca Galdeano under the direction of Laboratory Director Meg
Cruse.
The fieldwork was conducted between October 2 and 20, 2000. Records and artifacts will
be curated at the Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory (TARL) at the University of Texas at Austin,

J. J. Pickle Research Campus.
Testing at Site 41RK270 indicated it had been severely impacted as a result of past logging
activities and erosion. The site is ephemeral and lacked intact cultural features. Site 41RK272 was revealed
to be an ephemeral lithic scatter, consisting of a single non-diagnostic lithic debitage flake. Site 41RK275
was shown to be a large and very diffuse lithic scatter. A discrete portion of the site contained thermally
altered rock and burned nut shells. Trenching in this site area did not result in the identification of intact
cultural features. About a half dozen pieces of thermally altered rock, designated as Feature 1, were
recovered from three adjacent 1 meter (m) x 1 m hand excavated units. However, the origin of these items
could not be confidently ascertained. Half of these items were recovered during screening rather than during

41RK284 was shown to be a low-density lithic scatter lacking in cultural features.
For the above reasons none of the sites are thought to contain additional data that could
significantly add to understanding the prehistory of the region. They are therefore not considered eligible
for NRHP inclusion by PBS&J archaeologists.

II. NATURAL SETTING
CLIMATE
The permit area is characterized by a humid subtropical climate, with an average of 243 frostfree days per year, typically extending from March 17 to November 15. Temperatures average 8 degrees
Celsius ( 0 C) in winter, 16°C in spring, 25°C in summer, and l7°C in fall. Average annual rainfall for the
area is approximately 117 centimeters (cm), ranging from 60 cm in 1963 to 172 cm in 1957. Summer is
typically the driest season of the year, and spring is usually the wettest; monthly rainfall averages range from
a low of 7 cm in August to a high of 12 cm in May (Orton 1975).
GEOLOGY
Located within the West Gulf Coastal Plain of the Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic province,
as defined by Fenneman (1938), the surface topography of the Mine is characterized by rolling hills and
dendritic drainage systems. Three major lithostratigraphic units have been identified in the permit area:
Carrizo Sand, Reklaw Formation, and Quaternary alluvium.
Most of the permit area is underlain by sediments of Eocene age, represented by members
of the Claiborne group; Quaternary alluvium is also present. The Mine is situated between two prominent
structural features: the Sabine Uplift to the east and the structurally low East Texas embayment to the west.
The Claiborne group within the permit area is represented by two major units, the Carrizo
Sand and the Reklaw Formation. The Carrizo Sand unconformably overlies the Wilcox in this area and is
not always present (Ambrose 1986; Hall Southwest Water Consultants, Inc. [HSW] 1986). This unit
represents an ancient fluvial system that is lithologically and stratigraphically distinct from the underlying
Wilcox (Kaiser 1986). On the basis of well log information, the Carrizo has been informally divided into
two units, a lower sandy unit and an upper fine-grained unit (HSW 1986); neither of these, however, is
easily recognized at the surface except in eroded or disturbed areas. Thickness of the Carrizo commonly
varies from 6 to 30 m (Barnes 1975).
Unconformably overlying the Carrizo Sand is the Reklaw Formation, which represents the
marine transgression that followed the fluvial deposition of the Carrizo. Although commonly undivided, two
subdivisions of this unit are formally recognized. The lower unit, or Newby Sand, ranges in thickness from
1to10 m and is a muddy, very fine- to fine-grained quartz sand containing variable amounts of glauconite.
The upper portion of the Reklaw is known as the Marquez Shale, which is identified as a very glauconitic
sandy clay with interbedded glauconitic sands.

In addition to the Carrizo and Reklaw, the third major lithostratigraphic unit present is
Quaternary alluvium. This unit is most commonly found along major, and occasionally minor, tributaries
within the permit area and consists of various fine-grained deposits. Best developed along Mill and Tiawichi
creeks, this unit is comprised primarily of Holocene to recent floodplain deposits, although occasional
Pleistocene terraces may be found along the margins. This unit is also present within the permit area in the
form of minor colluvial and eolian deposits on and along the margins of hills and floodplains. These deposits
are small, spatially discontinuous and are difficult to define, given the relatively homogenous sands found
within the Eocene units that comprise their source.
The following sources are postulated for the origin of the lithic raw materials used by the
prehistoric inhabitants of the investigated sites discussed in this report. The chert and quartzite items
probably originated from lag gravels of post-Eocene age. These may be considered as analogous to the
Uvalde Gravels first identified by Hill (1891). Banks (1990) notes that deposits identical to the Uvalde
Gravels have been found in Hopkins and Red River counties in northeast Texas. Similarly, the silicified
wood items may have originated from these same lag gravels, but may also be attributed to deposits of this
material found in the Claiborne Group, thus being of Eocene age. The hematitic sandstone utilized for
ground stone implements is also probably derived from these Eocene age strata.
SOILS
The soils on the tested sites have been mapped as Bernaldo, Bowie, Darco, Tenaha and
Redsprings. On site these soils were moderately deep to deep sandy to fine sandy loam.
FLORA
The Mine is located in the Pineywoods vegetational region as described and delineated by
Hatch et al. (1990). This area is characterized by extensive forests of pines and hardwoods.
PREHISTORIC FOOD SOURCES
Ethnohistoric accounts of the subsistence practices and organic remains recovered from
Caddoan archaeological sites afford a view of the large array of plant foods that were exploited, both wild
and cultivated. Among the latter were corn, beans, sunflowers, and pumpkins. The vast array of wild plants
eaten included nuts, such as hickory (Carya sp.), pecan (Carya illinoiensis), chinkapin (Castanea pumila),
acorns (Quercus sp.), and black walnut (Juglens nigra); plums (Prunus sp.); persimmons (Diospyros sp.);
grapes (Vitus sp.); strawberries (Frageria virginiana); edible roots; and a variety of herbs and seeds from

annuals, such as knotweed (Polygonum sp.), goosefoot (Chenopodium sp.), marshelder (Iva sp.), and wild
lettuce (Lactuca sp.) (Swanton 1942; Crane 1982; Perttula and Bruseth 1983).
Animal foods were equally important and varied. Again using ethnohistoric data derived from
early contacts with the Caddo, these resources included white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), black
bear (Ursus americanus), cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus sp.), opossum (Didelphis virginiana), squirrel (Sciurns
sp.), raccoon (Procyon lotor), dog (Canisfamiliaris), various birds (i.e. ducks and geese (Anatidae), turkey
(Meleagris gallopavo), quail (Colinus virginianus), and prairie chicken (Tympanuchus cupido).
Bison (Bison bison) may have existed in very limited numbers in east Texas during prehistoric
times, as their remains have been encountered at a number of archaeological sites in adjacent areas (Neuman
1983). Early historic accounts, however, indicate bison were not found in the forests of east Texas, but
were hunted in the plains to the west. In 1691, Casanas located the herds about 4 days' travel from the
Nabedache village, and Hasinai hunting parties established a well-defined path between the Brazos and the
Trinity rivers in their forays to and from the bison range (Casanas de Jesus Maria 1927; Griffith 1954: 113).
In addition to mammals, fish, such as gar (Lepisosteus sp.), bowfin (Amia calva), pickerel

(Esox sp.), catfish (lctaluridae) and bass (Centrarchidae), and reptiles and amphibians, including snapping
turtle ( Chelydra serpentina), lizards (lgaunidae), snakes (Colubridae), and frogs (Rana sp.), were also
exploited (Swanton 1942; Perttula and Bruseth 1983).

III. CULTURAL SETTING
EARLY ARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS IN NORTHEAST TEXAS
Archaeological investigations in the eastern United States began with a focus on the early
religious myths involving mound sites and a desire to obtain objects frequently associated with these mound
sites. The Mississippi and Ohio river valleys saw much of this early activity (Atwater 1820; Squier and
Davis 1848). Northeast Texas remained at the periphery of this activity until the first decades of the
twentieth century. Spurred by exploration of archaeological sites by steamboat along the Red River in
Louisiana (Moore 1912), J. E. Pearce, in 1919 and 1920, set out to record sites in Cherokee, Harrison,
Henderson, Hopkins and Hunt counties (Barnard 1939). Working for the University of Texas, Pearce laid
the groundwork for studies which were to follow.
From 1927 to 1936, Pearce arranged for additional archaeological work in Texas, much of
which centered in east Texas. In Titus County in the early 1930s, at least eight sites were tested (Thurmond
1981), including the Hale Mound (41TT12) and the Keith Mound (41TT11) (Jackson 1934a; Goldschmidt
1934). In Panola County, a review of the survey notes of A. T. Jackson for 1934 identified three sites which
were later given Smithsonian trinomial numbers 41PN1, 41PN5 and 41PN15 (Jackson 1934b). Jackson
(1935) reported on at least three sites in Rusk County, 41RK1, 41RK2, 41RK6, the last of which was
reportedly tested. Site 41RK4 was reported in the early 1930s by Jackson and Woosley (Woosley 1939).
In 1935, Goldschmidt prepared a synthesis of archaeological sites in Titus County and their
relationship to sites in east Texas. Although basically a trait list comparison, a cultural chronology was
established for the area. The importance of this early work is that it was one of the first attempts at defining
a chronological framework. For Rusk County, the 1939/1940 TARL files show a listing of 26 sites in a
catalogue of east Texas sites (Hughes 1948). No site descriptions were given and no precise locations were
documented for the sites. These early works would later serve as a basis for the regional syntheses of
Krieger (1946) and Suhm et al. (1954).
Beginning with the establishment of the Inter-Agency Archeological Salvage Program in 1946,
and the initiation of the River Basin Surveys Program in the late 1940s, numerous investigations were
conducted in the following decades in northeast Texas (Anderson 1971; Davis 1958; Davis and Davis 1960;
Hsu 1969; Sullivan 1977). In adjacent Panola County, one such survey was conducted in conjunction with
the construction of Toledo Bend Reservoir on the Sabine River. In this survey, Scurlock and Davis (1962)
located 160 sites in the reservoir. Of this total, seven sites were documented for Panola County: 41PN6 41PN12. One site (41PN6) was designated as possibly Paleoindian; one site (41PN9) was identified as
Archaic, and two sites (41PN8, 41PN12) were identified as possibly Caddoan. The chronological positions

440674/000400

of the remaining Panola County sites were not determined. In 1969, a single site (41PN13) was located by
Tom Deppe in southwest Panola County along Murvaul Bayou, under the present Lake Murvaul. In 1968,
a reconnaissance survey of the then-proposed Ponta Reservoir, located on the Angelina River in Cherokee,
Nacogdoches, and Rusk counties, was conducted by archaeologists from Southern Methodist University.
Ten prehistoric sites, including three in Rusk County, were recorded.
PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS - RUSK COUNTY AND THE MINE
It was during the 1930s and 1940s that cultural resources in Rusk County and the Mine were

first examined (Jackson 1935; Hughes 1948). It was not until the 1970s, however, that more systematic
investigations were conducted, mostly in response to reservoir development (Skinner 1971; McDonald 1972;
Clark and Ivey 1974). Coupled with surveys for the lignite mining industry, this trend has continued into
the present decade (Northern 1981; Northern and Skiles 1981; Skinner et al. 1981; Moncure and Jackson
1980, 1982; Jackson 1982, 1983; Heartfield et al. 1984).
Within the Mine boundary, numerous investigations have been undertaken by previous
investigators. The investigations range from survey, archaeological testing, and data recovery (Moncure
and Jackson 1980, 1982; Jackson 1982, 1983; Heartfield et al. 1984; Glander et al. 1987; Rogers et al.
1992, 1994; Rogers 1997; Skokan et al. 1997a,b; Sherman and Nash 1998; Sherman et al. 2000).
Site 41RK214, the Oak Hill Village site (Rogers and Perttula in preparation), is located on
a long, narrow ridge east of and overlooking the floodplain of Mill Creek. The principle occupation at this
site is Middle Caddoan, but artifacts dating from late Paleoindian through late Archaic have also been
recovered. The data recovery investigations utilized a combination of machine and hand excavations to
expose 100 percent of the site. These excavations resulted in the identification of 36 Caddoan house
structures, six smaller structures which may be storage facilities or granaries, three burials, two trash
middens, 165 other cultural features, approximately 25,000 ceramic artifacts, and more than 6,000 lithic
artifacts. The draft report is currently under review by the THC.
CULTURAL HISTORY
A detailed cultural history for the Mine is provided in Skokan et al. (1997a). An abbreviated
history is included here beginning with the Archaic period, as the earliest component identified during the
current project dated to this period.

Archaic Stage (6000-400 B.C.)
The Archaic stage is typically defined as the temporal epoch when migratory hunting and
gathering cultures adapted to changing environmental conditions through expanded exploitation of varied
ecological niches and development of a more varied cultural assemblage to exploit these different
environments and resources. Early Archaic populations made their living in much the same way as their
Paleoindian predecessors. In terms of material culture, the Archaic stage is characterized by less carefully
fashioned, increasingly varied tool kits and a decrease in the use of exotic raw materials. Story (1990:213)
suggests that these phenomena reflect a decrease in the spatial area of the seasonal round and a shift to more
expedient, task-specific tool use. It is suggested that utilization of floral and faunal resources reached an
optimal diversity during the Early Archaic, which was accompanied by changes in the methods of food
procurement and preparation.

In most areas of the southeast, human populations saw a gradual and

continued expansion throughout the Archaic period.
Terraces and floodplain projections are noted by Thurmond (1990) to be the locations of many
Archaic sites. Hunting and gathering provided a subsistence of deer and small mammals, along with
seasonally available vegetal foods. Seasonal rounds within a restricted territory are projected as typifying
the settlement pattern during this stage (Hsu 1969; Hsu et al. 1969:32; McCormick 1973:11-15;
Northern 1981:6). These seasonal rounds may have served to permit the interacting of populations, and
allowed for the spread of cultigens or other cultural innovations (Story 1985:54).
Data provided by Thurmond (1990) suggest that there is an increase in the frequency of Early
Archaic sites from the Paleoindian stage and that this increase in site frequency or density continues at least
until the Early Ceramic stage. Along Big Sandy Creek in Upshur County, Early Archaic sites appear to be
distributed on terrace and upland projections within major drainage basins (Perttula et al. 1986:50). Similar
patterns have been found elsewhere (Jones 1957; Bruseth and Perttula 1981; Anderson 1973:162).
Middle Archaic sites are better represented in the archaeological data than preceding
occupations, at least in terms of excavated components (Johnson 1962; Bruseth and Perttula 1980, 1981;
Voellinger 1984). Settlement patterns appear to be little changed from previous stages (Perttula et al.
1986:51), although site density appears to increase (Thurmond 1990). Within the Martin Lake mine
complex in Panola County, Site 41PN76 may reflect a Middle Archaic occupation (Glander et al. 1986:
94-95).
For the Late Archaic, there is a continued increase in site density, especially along tributaries
to major drainages (Thurmond 1990; Perttula et al. 1986:52). Perttula et al. (1986:52) suggest that the more
widely dispersed settlements in the region are indicative of a diffuse economy based upon the hunting and

440674/000400

PBSJ

gathering oflocal food resources. Northern (1981:7) suggests that fishing and mussel collection intensified,
and this intensification reflected a shift from a restricted wandering community pattern to a more centrally
based pattern. Numerous sites in the region with Late Archaic components have been excavated in the
region (Jones 1957; Duffield 1963; Johnson 1962; Voellinger 1984; Bruseth and Perttula 1980, 1981).
Early Ceramic or Woodland Stage (400 B.C.-A.D. SQQ)
The concept of an Early Ceramic or Woodland stage is not new (Bell 1953; Jelks 1965; Webb
et al. 1969; Fields and Thurmond 1980; Thurmond 1990; Wyckoff and Fisher 1985). Story (1990:293)
refers to the stage as the Early Ceramic period and Perttula et al. (1986) refer to it generally as the
Woodland period. Significant Early Ceramic components have been identified at the Resch site in southern
Harrison County (Webb et al. 1969), the Folly site in northeastern Rusk County (Jarvis 1972), the Haddens
Bend site in southwestern DeSoto Parish, Louisiana (Jensen 1968), the Coral Snake Mound in the Toledo
Bend Reservoir area (Mcclurkan et al. 1966, 1980), and the Yarbrough site and several sites in the Lake
Fork Reservoir in Wood County (Bruseth and Perttula 1981; Perttula and Skiles 1988). Generally, these
sites are defined by sandy paste ceramics as well as wares associated with Tchefuncte, Coles Creek, and
Marksville periods, probably introduced from the Lower Mississippi Valley. In Titus County, Thurmond
(1990) identified Marksville ceramics at Site 41TT108 in the Cypress Creek Basin. In Gregg County, Jones
(1968:25) identified a Troyville sherd from the Ware Acres site.
Caddoan Stage (A.D. 800-A.D. 1680)
The succeeding stage in northeast Texas is associated with the Caddo development. Wyckoff
(1971) visualizes Caddo culture as a peripheral recipient of the uniformities attributed to the "Mississippian
Pattern" of the Lower Mississippi Valley. Caddo is recognized by the presence of mound centers and village
sites along the terraces of major streams. Horticultural, and eventually agricultural, activities supplemented
hunting and gathering activities. As defined by ritual burials and trade networks, a stratified society was
probably typical of Caddo culture.
Krieger's (1946) Gibson Fulton Aspect dichotomy was revised to the currently used five-stage
Caddo sequence by the Eleventh Caddoan Conference in 1968 (Davis 1970). Caddo I and II relate to
Krieger's Gibson Aspect, and Caddo III, IV and V correspond to the Fulton Aspect. Many problems have
arisen from the use of the five-stage sequence, largely because it was devised to describe cultural complexes
rather than chronological assignment.

Story (1990:324) has suggested abandoning the Caddo I-V

terminology and replacing it with an explicitly defined temporal framework of five periods:

Maize has been recovered from flotation samples from Early Caddoan sites and settlement patterns seem to
consist of dispersed hamlets and farmsteads (Perttula et al. 1986:54-55).
Thurmond (1990) observes that ca A.D. 1400, the elements of Caddo material culture,
manifested archaeologically in ceramic and projectile point assemblages, differentiate along a line drawn
roughly north to south somewhat west of Caddo Lake in Harrison County, Texas. The observed differences
west to east are hypothesized by Thurmond (1990) to represent probable social groups.
The Late Caddoan stage appears to be noted by an increase in regional variants. The Whelan
and Titus phases of the Late Caddoan stage are proposed by Thurmond (1990) to represent the Cypress
Cluster, a culture which is hypothesized to represent a possible third Caddoan Confederacy. This unnamed
confederacy is in addition to the Hasinai and Kadohadacho confederacies (Swanton 1942) and is hypothesized
to be centered in the upper Cypress Creek drainage basin adjacent the permit area to the north.

IV. RESEARCH DESIGN
RESEARCH GOALS
The primary research goal was to assess the archaeological data potential each site possessed.
This included determining if isolable components and intact features with datable remains were present.
Secondary research objectives were to: 1) assess how these sites were used throughout their occupational
history, and 2) determine how they fit within the context of regional settlement patterns.
Specific research questions included: 1) were intact cultural features with datable organic
remains present? 2) could.site components be isolated stratigraphically or horizontally? 3) could the function
of the identified site components be determined?
RESEARCH TOPICS
Cultural Affiliation
During testing, temporally diagnostic artifacts were recovered only from sites 41RK270 and
41RK275. A small assemblage of non-decorated, probable Caddoan, ceramic sherds were recovered from
Site 41RK270. Two probable Caddoan sherds were recovered from Site 41RK275 along with a single
probable Gary dart point.
Settlement/Subsistence
The only subsistence remains recovered during these investigations were burned nut shells
from Site 41RK275. Nutting stones were recovered from sites 41RK275 and 41RK284, supporting the
interpretation that nuts were processed and perhaps consumed on site.
Spatial Patternini:
Testing showed that sites 41RK270 and 41RK272 were too small and lacked sufficient
quantities of temporally diagnostic materials to enable the horizontal separation of individual components.
Site 41RK275 was large, but very diffuse, and lacked sufficient quantities of temporally diagnostic remains
to allow horizontal separation of components.

However, two apparent artifact concentrations were

documented. Site 41RK284 contained two artifact high density areas.

440674/000400

METHODOLOGY
Fieldwork
A phased approach was utilized to investigate these sites.
PHASE I
Phase I consisted of an intensive program of shovel testing across each site. Each site was
shovel tested at approximate grid intercepts of 10 m, to assess clinal variation in artifact density. The shovel
testing program was based on the assumption that site areas with high artifact density and diversity resulted
from more intensive prehistoric use than areas with low artifact density and diversity and, as such, have a
higher probability of containing intact cultural features. This method has been used successfully at other
sites located within the Mine (Sherman et al. 2000). Artifact density was measured in artifacts per shovel
test and artifact contours were predicted using Surferrn.
PHASE II
Following the completion of Phase I, hand excavated units were used to sample artifact high
density and diversity areas. A single 1 x 1 m unit was excavated by hand at Site 41RK270. Because only
one artifact, a piece of lithic debitage, was recovered from Site 41RK272, no hand excavation was conducted
there. Four 1 x 1 m units were excavated at Site 41RK275, all of which were placed in the artifact high
density area with the greatest diversity of cultural materials. This work revealed the presences of a very
small thermally altered rock feature. Two 1 m x 1 m units were excavated on Site 41RK284, each within
a separate high artifact density area.
PHASE III
Due to the results of phases I and II, mechanical trenching was conducted only at sites
41RK275 and 41RK284. All trenches were approximately 10 min length. Following their excavation, the
long walls of each trench were troweled by hand in an effort to locate cultural features. This work did not
result in the identification of any intact cultural features.

440674/000400

13

PHASEN
If Phase ill resulted in the location of intact cultural features a representative sample would

have been excavated during Phase IV. As no intact cultural features were identified during trenching,
Phase N was never implemented.
Radiometric Analysis
Burned nut shell fragments were recovered in apparent association with the ephemeral thermally
altered rock feature at 41RK275 and a sample has been submitted to Beta Analytic for dating.
Special Studies
Feature 1, at Site 41RK275 was the only feature identified during the current testing
operations. Because this feature was small and of dubious integrity, magnetic susceptibility studies were not
done.

I.aboratory Methodology
All recovered cultural materials were returned to the Archaeological Laboratory at PBS&J
for processing preparatory to analysis.

Non-organic remains were washed, dried and catalogued by

provenience.
The assemblage of lithic tools was examined under low-power microscopy in order to identify
patterns of use ware. Morphological characteristics of projectile points were used to identify cultural
affiliation. The entire lithic assemblage, including tools and debitage, was classified into raw material
categories.
Ceramic artifacts can provide important clues to cultural affiliation.

To this end, the

variability in physical characteristics were analyzed. Important attributes include paste characteristics,
oxidation patterns, surface treatments, sherd thickness, vessel part, shape and decoration. Following Teltser
(1993) the firing environment was assessed for each sherd larger than 2 cm. Smaller sherds, or sherdlets,
were not analyzed. Where possible sherds were classified according to established types based on decorative
technique.

V. RESULTS OF TESTING
SITE 41RK270
Natural Setting
Site 41RK270 is a prehistoric lithic and sherd scatter located on an interfluve between two
unnamed tributaries of Todd Branch. The soils on site were a deep gravelly sandy loam that extended in
depth from 0 to 100 centimeters below surface (cmbs) and were mapped in the Redsprings series (MorisonKnudsen [M-K] 1993).
The site has been subjected to a number of historic transformations that have resulted in
disturbance to much of it. An old road bed and a berm, likely representing logging activities, traverse the
site (Figure 3). Parts of the site also appeared to have been bulldozed. Some of the site has also been
severely impacted by erosion. Two deeply entrenched erosional drainages follow the old road bed, one on
either side.
Background
When first recorded (Skokan 1997b), the site was in a pine forest and the ground surface was
obscured by pine duff. At that time, 10 shovel tests were excavated to assess its extent. Of these shovel
tests, five were culturally positive, yielding four pieces of lithic debitage and six Caddoan ceramic sherds.
Shovel testing showed the site to be contained within a roughly 50 x 65 m area.
VlorkPerformed

Shovel Testing
Twenty shovel tests (Figure 3) were excavated at approximate grid intercepts of 10 m at
Site 41RK270 to assess the vertical and horizontal distribution of cultural materials. Three of these shovel
tests were culturally positive yielding six sherdlets, one sherd, and seven pieces of non-diagnostic lithic
debitage. The majority of these materials (all but two flakes) were recovered from Shovel Test 14. Artifacts
were distributed fairly evenly throughout the vertical column. Vlith the exception of Level 9 (80 - 90 cmbs)
which was sterile, one to four artifacts were recovered from levels 3 through 11 (20 - 110 cmbs).

Hand Excavation
A single 1 m x 1 m unit was excavated by hand adjacent to Shovel Test 14. Materials
recovered from this unit include 19 pieces of non-diagnostic lithic debitage, 1 ceramic sherd, 1 thermally
altered rock, and 11 fragments of unidentified bone. The bone was badly weathered and not burned. For
these reasons it was considered to have recent and natural origins rather than prehistoric and cultural ones.
Cultural materials were distributed fairly evenly throughout the vertical column from Level 2 (10 - 20 cmbs)
through Level 9 (10 - 90 cmbs).
Soil

The soil encountered in Unit 1 (Figure 4) was representative of that encountered across the
site and was a deep fine sandy loam that extended to more than 100 cmbs.

Two soil zones were

encountered. Zone I was a loose, single grain 10YR4/6 fine sandy loam root zone that extended from the
ground surface to 20 cmbs. Zone II, which extended from the base of the above to an unknown depth was
a 10YR6/4 loose, single grain fine sandy loam.
Diagnostic Artifacts
Ltihic Artifacts

With the exception of a single piece of thermally altered rock, the assemblage of lithic artifacts
was composed entirely of non-diagnostic lithic debitage. Raw materials represented in this assemblage
include 18 chert items, 6 quartzite items, 1 petrified wood item and 1 item of unknown material. All of
these materials were most likely obtained locally.
Ceramic Artifacts

The ceramic assemblage recovered from this site contained two sherds and five sherdlets. One
grog tempered sherd was part of a bowl with polished interior and exterior surfaces. This sherd was fired
in a reduced oxygen environment. One other artifact, a sherdlet, was tempered only with grog. On it, no
surface treatment was noted. The remaining four sherdlets and one sherd were tempered with grog and
bone. One of these had a smoothed interior surface and another had a smoothed interior surface with a red
slip with a smoothed exterior surface. The remaining sherdlets had no surface modifications.

Summary and Conclusions
The even vertical distribution of cultural materials on site suggests that these materials cycled
through the loose sediments. Bioturbation, from tree roots and tree fall as well as burrowing rodents may
account for this.
Following testing, the nature of the occupation of this site remains unclear. The small artifact
assemblage suggests that the site probably resulted from a low intensity occupation. The presence of a single
piece of thermally altered rock suggests that some subsistence processing may have occurred on site.
However, due to post depositional disturbances these conclusions remain speculative. The presence of a
small assemblage of Caddoan ceramic artifacts indicates that the site may represent a late prehistoric
farmstead or special activity site. This site lacks integrity and is not considered eligible for the NRHP by
PBS&J archaeologists. No further work and granting cultural resources clearance are recommended.
SITE 41RK272
Natural Setting
Site 41RK272 is a small prehistoric lithic and sherd scatter located on the backslope of a ridge
100 m east of the confluence of two unnamed tributaries of Todd Branch. Soils on site were mapped as
Bemaldo series (M-K 1993) and were a sandy loam that extended to around 100 cmbs. When recorded the
site was in pasture and thick grasses revealed no ground surface visibility. A pipeline crosses the southern
quarter of the site and apparently disturbed a portion of it.
Background
When first recorded, 15 shovel tests were excavated to determine the site's vertical and
horizontal extent (Skokan et al. 1997b). Of these shovel tests, five were culturally positive, yielding 12
pieces of lithic debitage, one prehistoric ceramic sherd, and one groundstone fragment. Cultural materials
were recovered from throughout the vertical column, from between 0 and 80 cmbs. The site was contained
within a roughly 30 m diameter area.

PBSJ

Work Performed

Shovel Testing
Thirty-three shovel tests were excavated on site to assess the horizontal and vertical
distribution of materials (Figure 5). Only Shovel Test 32 was culturally positive. It yielded a single piece
of non-diagnostic lithic debitage, a fine gained quartzite interior flake from Level 8 (70 - 80 cmbs). Due
to the sparse nature of the site, no mechanical or hand excavation was conducted.

Soil
The soil encountered in shovel tests contained three zones. Zone I extended from the ground
surface to between 10 and 20 cmbs and was a firm, blocky, sandy loam plowzone. This zone was light
brown in color with occasional mottles of orange sand. Zone II was a pale brown, firm, blocky sandy loam
with orange mottles that became more pronounced with depth. Zone II extended from the base of the above
to between 50 and 80 cmbs. Zone III was a hard sandy clay that extended to an unknown depth. This zone
was light orange with pale brown mottles.
Summary and Conclusions
The ephemeral nature of the site suggests it resulted from a short duration, possibly single
event, occupation. The ceramic sherds recovered when the site was recorded suggests that this took place
during the Late Prehistoric, Caddoan occupation of northeast Texas. The sparse nature of the site precludes
a more detailed interpretation and suggests that additional research there will not result in the acquisition of
data significant to the Caddo occupation of northeast Texas. For this reason, the site is not considered
eligible for NRHP inclusion by PBS&J archaeologists. No further work and granting cultural resources
clearance are recommended.
SITE 41RK275
Natural Setting
Site 41RK275 is a prehistoric lithic scatter located on the backslope of an upland ridge 100 m
north of Todd Branch. When recorded (Skokan et al. 1970) the site was partially in pasture and partially
wooded in young pine. Vegetation obscured the ground surface. Soils on site were mapped as Darco and
Tenaha series (M-K 1993) and consisted of a deep sandy loam extending more than 100 cmbs in depth.

Background
When originally recorded, a total of 17 shovel tests were excavated to define the site. Of
these, 6 were culturally positive, yielding 11 pieces of non-diagnostic lithic debitage and 1 projectile point
tip fragment. Artifacts were recovered from throughout the vertical column from 0 to 100 cmbs. The site
was shown to be confined within a roughly 85 m (east - west) by 50 m (north - south) area.
Work Performed

Shovel Testing
A total of 51 shovel tests were excavated on site to assess the vertical and horizontal
distribution of materials (Figure 6). Of these shovel tests, 31 were culturally positive yielding, 67 pieces
of non diagnostic lithic debitage, 1 Gary projectile point, 1 biface fragment, 1 piece of thermally altered rock
with evidence of grinding, one ceramic sherd, 2 burned nut hulls, and 1 small fragment of charcoal.
The ceramic and lithic materials were fairly evenly distributed throughout the vertical column
from Levels 1 to Level 11 (0 - 110 cmbs). Levels 1 through 7 (0 - 70 cmbs) yielded between five and eight
artifacts each (between 7 and 11.27 percent of the shovel test total). Level 8 (70- 80 cmbs) contained a total
of 17 artifacts (representing 24 percent of the shovel test total). Below this level, the artifact recovery rate
dropped precipitously.
Two high density artifact areas were identified by shovel testing (Figure 7). The primary
concentration was centered around shovel tests 9 and 18, while the secondary concentration was centered
over shovel tests 3 and 13. The former high density area contained lithic debitage, the Gary projectile
point, the piece of thermally altered rock, and burned nut hulls. The second contained the biface fragment,
lithic debitage, and the piece of charcoal.

Hand Excavation
It was decided that hand excavation efforts would be expended on the primary high artifact

density. This decision was based on the presence of thermally altered rock, burned nut hulls, and tools in
the primary concentration, which suggested it had a higher probability of containing an intact buried feature
than the secondary concentration. The carbon from the secondary high artifact density area could not be
identified, which meant it had less certain cultural origins than the burned nut hull in the primary
concentration. The secondary high artifact density area was at a somewhat lower elevation from most of

the rest of the site. For this reason it was felt that the materials found there may have been re-deposited via
colluvial activity.
In all, four 1mx1 m units were excavated by hand. Units 1, 3, and 4 were excavated near

Shovel Test 9, the one from where the thermally altered rock and the Gary projectile point were recovered.
Unit 2 was excavated near Shovel Test 18, from where lithic debitage and burned nut hulls were recovered.

Unit 1 was excavated through Level 12 (120 cmbs). Materials recovered from this unit
include seven pieces of non-diagnostic lithic debitage, one piece of thermally altered rock, two burned nut
hulls, and one piece of charcoal. Feature 1 was also encountered in this unit.
Feature 1
Feature 1 was identified in Unit 1 at 94 cmbs. This feature consisted of three pieces of
thermally altered rock near the southwest comer of the unit. One of the pieces of thermally altered rock was
a fragment from a metate. Other materials recovered in association with this feature include two pieces of
lithic debitage, two burned nut hulls, and one biface fragment.
No evidence of soil discoloration, either from carbon or heating, was associated with this
feature. It remains likely, due to the presence of thermally altered rock, that this feature represents the
remains of a hearth or roasting pit. The presence of the burned nut hulls along with the fact that one of the
thermally altered rock fragments was also a metate fragment suggests that this feature resulted in part from
processing nuts.
Unit 2
Unit 2 was located just to the north of Shovel Test 18 and excavated to 103 cmbs. Materials
recovered form this unit include 41 pieces of lithic debitage and 1 burned nut hull.

Unit 3 was excavated by expanding Unit 1 to the west. This unit was excavated to 100 cmbs.
This Unit was excavated to determine if the feature identified in Unit 1 continued to the west. Three pieces
of thermally altered rock (two from 50 - 60 cmbs and one from 90 - 100 cmbs) were recovered during
screening. Although these rocks were not found directly associated with Feature 1, they likely represent the

440674/000400

25

same activity. One of the pieces of thermally altered rock from this unit was also a metate fragment and it
fit with the similar piece recovered in Unit 1. Other materials recovered from this unit include 10 pieces
of non-diagnostic lithic debitage distributed throughout the vertical column and 1 burned nut hull from Level
9 (80 - 90 cmbs).

Unit 4 was excavated by expanding Unit 3 to the south, in an attempt to find more of
Feature 1. This unit was excavated to 100 cmbs. One piece of thermally altered hematitic sandstone was
recovered from Level 7 (60 - 70 cmbs). This, like the rock recovered in Unit 3 above, plausibly resulted
from the same activity as that associated with Feature 1. Other materials recovered from this unit include
seven pieces of lithic debitage and one ceramic sherd. The sherd was recovered from Level 8 (70 - 80 cmbs)
and therefore appears to be associated with the thermally altered rock.
Soil

The soil encountered in Unit 1 (Figure 8) was fairly representative of what was found across
the site. Two soil zones were encountered. Zone I was a 10YR5/2 loose, single grain, sandy loam Ap
horizon. This zone extended from the ground surface to around 20 cmbs. Zone II extended from the base
of the above to an unknown depth. It was a 10YR6/3, slightly compact and structureless, single grain sandy
loam. Occasional lamallae were noted in the profile below around 70 cmbs in Zone II.

Mechanical Excavation
Eight backhoe trenches (Figure 7) were excavated across the site to search for intact cultural
features. Following excavation the walls of each trench were troweled by hand in effort to locate cultural
features. No features were found. Each trench was excavated to approximately 150 cmbs. The soils
encountered there were the same as that in the shovel tests and hand excavated units. Basal clay was never
encountered. Table 1 provides a list of materials recovered from each trench.

1950 with .174 relative area under the probability distribution.
Artifacts
Gary Projectile Points

Two Gary projectile points were recovered during testing. One specimen (Figure 9a) was
recovered from Shovel Test 9, Level 10 (90 - 100 crnbs). This specimen was crudely formed from pale
orange chert. It is 33.80 millimeters (mm) in maximum length by 17.80 mm at the shoulders, by 8.51 mm
in maximum thickness. The blade is triangular and the shoulders are distinct. The stern contracts slightly
and terminates in a slightly rounded base. Small step fractures were noted on the edges. A regular pattern
of micro flaking is also evident on the edges. This specimen has been well used and probably resharpened
prior to discard. The point is complete and the reason for discard could not be determined.
The second Gary projectile point (Figure 9b) was recovered in Trench 8. It was formed from
petrified wood. It is 43.36 mm in maximum length, 15.83 mm at the shoulders, and 8.23 mm in maximum
thickness.

convex and irregular, possibly reflecting resharpening. One shoulder is missing and the other is indistinct.

Ceramic Artifacts
Two ceramic vessel body sherds were recovered during testing. Both sherds lacked surface
decoration but had a polished interior surface and a smoothed exterior surface. Both sherds were tempered
with grog. Based on examination of the cores of the sherds, one was fired in a high oxygen environment
and one was fired in a reduced oxygen environment.

Nutting Stones!GroundstonefI'hennally Altered Rock
Thermal alteration noted in this assemblage includes fire cracking and reddening. Some of
the rocks showing signs of thermal alteration also showed signs of grinding or use as either a metate or
nutting stone. In all 14 lithic artifacts were recovered that showed evidence of grinding, use as a nutting
stone, or thermal alteration, or some combination of these. All of these items are hematite or hematitic
sandstone.
Two rocks showed evidence of use as a nutting stone with no evidence of thermal alteration,
one of which also showed evidence of grinding. A third nutting stone was recovered that was also fire
cracked. Two pieces of thermally altered rock appeared to be metate fragments. These items were recovered
from adjacent hand excavated units and are fitters. Three pieces of thermally altered rock were also ground.
The remaining six rocks showed only signs of thermal alteration. Half of these items were actual fire
cracked, while half were merely reddened.

Worked Tabular Hematite
A single piece of worked tabular hematite was recovered (Figure 9c). This specimen is
266 mm in length by 109.51 mm in maximum width by 29.43 mm in maximum thickness. A portion of one
of the short sides, extending about 36. 75 mm, has been bifacially flaked and ground. This artifact could be
considered to be a very large celt preform that was discarded before it was finished. The reason for discard
could not be determined.
Summary and Conclusions
The distribution of cultural materials on site plausibly indicates that it resulted from two or
more separate occupations. The density of materials recovered further suggests that none of these individual

440674/0004-00

PBSJ

occupations were particularly intense. This presence of burned nut hulls, thermally altered rock, and nutting
and grinding stones likely indicates that the site resulted in part from processing, and possibly consuming,
nuts. This interpretation is supported by the presence of Feature 1, a small concentration of thermally
altered rock associated with burned nut hulls.
The presence of Gary projectile points suggests that Site 41RK275 was occupied during the
latter part of the Archaic period. The presence of the two ceramic sherds suggests occupation during the
Late Prehistoric Caddo period. However, Gary dart points are commonly found on Caddo sites in northeast
Texas. The radio carbon sample post dates both the lithic and ceramic diagnostic assemblages.
The ephemeral nature of the site indicates that none of the site occupations were very intense
and all were most likely of short duration. For this reason, it is not likely that additional data important to
understanding the Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric occupation of northeast Texas is present on site. This
site is, therefore, not considered eligible for NRHP inclusion and no further work is recommended.
SITE 41RK284
Natural Setting
Site 41RK284 is a small prehistoric lithic scatter located on the backslope of a low, broad
interfluve. Soils on site were mapped as Bowie series (M-K 1993) and consisted of a deep sandy loam that
extended more than 100 cmbs in depth. When first recorded (Skokan et al. 1997b) the site was in a mixed
pine forest with no ground surface visibility. At that time 16 shovel tests were excavated to determine the
site's extent. Five shovel tests were culturally positive, yielding 12 pieces of non-diagnostic lithic debitage.
Cultural materials were distributed between 0 and 110 cmbs. Shovel testing showed the site to be contained
within a roughly 40 m diameter area.
During the current field effort it was noted that an unknown portion of the site had been
disturbed as a result of construction of two berms (Figure 10). These berms paralleled the contour of the
hillside upon which the site was located.

Work Performed

Shovel Testing
A total of 38 shovel tests were excavated to assess the site's vertical and horizontal extend.
Twenty-eight shovel tests were excavated at approximate 10 m grid intercepts. Following this effort, an
additional 10 shovel tests were excavated in cardinal directions, at 5 m intervals around positive shovel tests.
Of the total number, eight shovel tests were culturally positive.
Materials recovered during shovel testing include 13 pieces of non diagnostic lithic debitage
and 1 hematite nutting stone. Shovel testing revealed the existence of two discrete artifact high density areas
(Figure 11), one encompassed shovel tests 22, 23, 32, 33, and 34, while the other encompassed shovel tests
18, 25, and 27. The former high density are contained lithic debitage and the nutting stone. The latter
contained only lithic debitage.
Artifacts were fairly evenly distributed throughout the vertical column in the shovel tests.
Between 0 and 4 artifacts were recovered in levels 2 through 11. Level 6, with four lithic flakes, contained
the highest concentration of materials.

Hand Excavation
Two 1 m x 1 m units were excavated by hand to sample each of the artifact high density areas.

Unit 1 was excavated adjacent to Shovel Test 18. This unit was excavated to 125 cmbs. A
total of 49 pieces of lithic debitage were recovered from this unit. Cultural materials were evenly distributed
from 0 to 70 cmbs, from where between zero and six pieces of debitage were recovered from each 10 cm
level. Level 8 (70 - 80) cmbs contained 13 pieces of lithic debitage, constituting 26 percent of the unit total.
Between 4 and 8 pieces of debitage were recovered from each 10 cm level below this.

Unit 2 was excavated between shovel tests 22 and 32. This unit was excavated to 100 cmbs.
Only one artifact was recovered from this unit, a non-diagnostic piece of lithic debitage from Level 5
(40 - 50 cmbs).

Soils
The soil profile encountered in Unit 1 (Figure 12) was representative of that found across the
site. There, three soil zones were encountered. Zone 1 extended from the ground surface to about 10 cmbs.
It consisted primarily of leaf litter. Zone II extended from the base of the above to about 50 cmbs. It was
a 10YR7/4 slightly compact fine sandy loam with a single grain structure. Zone III extended from the base
of the above to an unknown depth. It was a 7 .5YR7/3 slightly firm fine sandy loam with a single grain
structure. This zone also contained occasional clay lamallae.
Lithic Artifacts
The assemblage of lithic debitage contained a total of 59 items. Of these, 40 were chert and
15 were quartzite. The remaining four were formed from petrified wood. In addition to the lithic debitage
a single hematite nutting stone was also recovered. All of these materials are widely available within the
vicinity.
Summary and Conclusions
The ephemeral nature of Site 41RK284, as well as the lack of temporally diagnostic materials,
limits interpretation to general statements. The lithic assemblage was too small to offer any more detailed
interpretations concerning reduction strategy. The nutting stone recovered suggests that nuts may have been
processed and consumed on site. Site 41RK284 is not considered eligible for NRHP inclusion by PBS&J
archaeologists and no further work, and granting cultural resources clearance, are recommended.

VI. RECOMMENDATIONS
Data recovered from sites 41RK270, 41RK272, 41RK275 and 41RK284 suggests that they
resulted from short term, and probably task specific occupations during the prehistoric period. Testing
excavations revealed that they are not likely to contain data significant to understanding the prehistoric
occupation of Rusk County and are consequently not considered eligible for NRHP inclusion by PBS&J
archaeologists.

For this reason, no further work and granting cultural resources clearance are

recommended.
