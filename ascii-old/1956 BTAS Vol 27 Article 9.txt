HISTORIC SURVIVAL OF THE ATLATL IN
THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI REGION 1
ALEX

D.

KRIEGER

This article developed as an attempt to explain a strange
discovery in Lamar County, reported to me at the University
of Texas in May 1955 by Henry Ogden of Paris, Texas. The
object in question is the nearly complete skull of a European
hog which has a large projectile point driven nearly straight
into the top of the braincase (Plate 26, A, B).
It is fairly well known that domesticated European hogs
were first introduced into the southeastern United States
by the De Soto expedition in 1541-43. Some of these animals
escaped from time to time, or were left behind when the
expedition disintegrated during its trials west of the Mississippi, and their descendants became the wild razorbacks
whch are now game animals in certain areas. Therefore,
it would not be remarkable that Indians would occasionally
have hunted the hogs during some 300 years following the
De Soto entrada. The puzzling aspect of this discovery is
that the chipped-stone projectile point is of a size and weight
that archaeologists now commonly regard as a "dart" point,
hafted to a light spear or javelin propelled with a "spearthrower" or "atlatl"- a weapon which, except for the cases
to be cited below, has never been recorded for Indians of the
historic period in the southeastern states or any other part
of the United States. By this I mean that the atlatl was
never seen in actual use by white men, so far as written
records go, except for two instances, both of which were
near the mouth of the Mississippi River in the early 16th
century.
1. I am verv much indebted to the following persons in the
Texas Game and F ish Commission in Austin for aid: to Clyde B.
Graham for a series of photographs of the skull; to William Jennings, biologist and Assistant Director of Wild Life Restoration, for
confirming my suspicion that the skull belonged to a European
domesticated hog; to Eugene S. Walker, Director of the Division of
Wild Life Restoration; and to Ed Ferguson, Editor of Texas Game
and Fish magazine for arranging for this work.

196

The Eskimo on the one hand, and the Indians of central
Mexico on the other, continued to use both atlatl and bow
in historic times, and indeed still use them for certain purposes. It seems remarkable, therefore, that the atlatl should
have passed out of existence so completely in nearly the
whole of North America before the appearance of Europeans. The archeological record, however, fully bears out
the theory that once the bow was introduced (probably not
long after the time of Christ in the Southwest and Southeast), it gradually supplanted the much older atlatl-a
process completed in most areas well before the beginning
of historic times. This theory is based not only on the relative size of the stone projectile points found in stratified
excavations, but on supplementary traits such as hooks
and weights for atlatls, and on fragments of the shafts belonging to the two weapons which have been preserved in
dry caves.
Putting aside the remote possibility that some presentday enthusiast found the "dart" point in the Lamar County
skull in an archeological site, mounted it on an arrow shaft,
and slew the hog as a sporting adventure with a bow, there
are two principal alternative explanations:
1. What the archeologists call "dart;' points were not
always connected with the atlatl, but were also used (at
least occasionally) on arrows. Thus, the hog may have been
killed with bow and arrow some time after such animals
were introduced into the Southeast by De Soto, and there
would be n othing remarkable about it.

2. The point was actually hafted to a "dart" and the hog
killed with an atlatl some time after De Soto. In other
words, this weapon survived in the Lamar County area
(and perhaps elsewhere) into early historic times despite
the absence of written records t o prove it. The bow was,
of course, the principal weapon here as well as everywhere
else when Europans appeared, as any number of documentary references attest; the only question is whether or not
the atlatl survived at all as another weapon.

We will examine these possibilities below. It is interesting, but not important to the argument, that the point was
driven into the top of the brain; perhaps the animal was
shot by a hunter in a tree, or perhaps it was already wounded
and shot in the head while lying on its side. The point hardly
seems large enough to have been used on the tip of a handthrust spear.
According to Mr. Ogden, the skull was found by Lanis
Cook in January 1955. Thirty years before, a long channel
was dug for the Sulphur River for better drainage, exposing
some gravel where Aud's Creek enters this channel, onehalf mile southwest of Slabtown and 12 miles south of Paris.
He states that "When seen, the point and a small amount of
the skull were all that was exposed and they had to be
dug from the gravel. I have searched the channel and the
entire locality a great deal and have identified some of the
points found as Harrell, Pogo, Bulverde, Darl, Edgewood,
Gary, Palmillas, Wells, one Scottsbluff fragment, one possible Pandale point, and several small arrow points with
broad barbs and expanding stems, a form not shown in the
Handbook. The pottery is Maydelle Incised, Bullard
Brushed, and Bailey Engraved or Spiro Engraved".
Obviously there is a mixture of materials here and the
gravel suggests a re-deposition. None of the types mentioned is known to belong to complexes of the historic period
in northeast Texas, and I am not sure which of the artifacts
mentioned came from the gravel and which from the surrounding ground. At any rate, the locality is an archeological site and the hog skull not merely an isolated find.
The bone around the imbedded point was shattered by the
impact and the point would have fallen out were it not that
the skull is filled with a partly cemented gravel, holding
it tight. For this reason, the point has not been removed
from its position. It can be seen, however, that it is a pale
reddish-gray quartzite, a common material for both "dart"
and "arrow" points in northeast Texas, and that, with its
broad shoulders and stem contracted to a rounded base, it

is positively of the Gary type (see Newell and Krieger, 1949,
pp. 164-166 and Fig. 57; Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks, 1954, p.
430 and Pl. 94). Its estimated length is at least 3 inches
(7.5 em.) and its width 1.5 inch (3.75 em.) across the
shoulders. It is thick and crudely chipped-partly because
of the material, as is common with most Gary and other
"dart" points in northeast Texas.
It may be mentioned here that all of the "Caddoan" archeological complexes or foci appear to include both "arrow" and
"dart" points but in greatly varying frequencies in the different foci. We still have much to learn about the relative
frequency of these two categories under controlled conditions in individual sites; but if the inference about "arrow"
versus "dart" points is approximately correct it is interesting
to note that in all foci of the Caddoan archeological culture
except one, the "arrows" greatly outnumber the "darts".
The exception is the McCurtain Focus, based primarily on
excavated sites in southeastern Oklahoma (Bell and Baerreis, 1951) and partly on other sites in the Red River valley
on both the Oklahoma and the Texas sides (Suhm, Krieger,
and Jelks, 1954, pp. 211-216). Recent work on burials in
the Kaufman site in Red River County, Texas (Harris, 1953)
furthermore shows that the McCurtain Focus extends into
historic times. As the Aud's Creek site, from which the hog
skull comes, is not far from some McCurtain Focus components, it is interesting to note that this focus, of all those
in the Caddoan area, shows a much greater frequency of
"dart" points than "arrow" p oints.
Possibly, then, there actually was an historic survival, or
a stronger local survival, of the atlatl in the approximate
area of the McCurtain Focus than there was in surrounding
areas. We may now turn to the two historic references to
actual use of the atlatl in the Southeast.
THE NARVAEZ EXPEDITION
In September 1528 the surviving members of the Narvaez
expedition, about 250 men, having been separated from their
ships and stranded in what is now northwestern Florida,

201

Historic Survival of the Atlatl

constructed five crude barges and attempted to make their
way around the Gulf of Mexico coast to Panuco in the
vicinity of present Tampico, Mexico. After several weeks
the barges crossed the mouth of a great river which can only
have been the Mississippi, and shortly afterward they were
cast up at different points on the shore of present Texas.
At a point which was perhaps two days travel by barge,
before reaching the Mississippi from the east, two Spaniards
who had gone ashore for water were captured by Indians,
and the remaining Spaniards held some other Indians
hostage until the two were returned. An impasse having
been reached, a battle commenced, told in the words of
Cabeza de Vaca (1906, pp. 40-41) as follows:
"Y como no nos quisiessen dar los christianos y por este
respecto nosotros no les diessemos los indios, comenzaronnos
a tirar piedras con hondas, y varas, con muestras de flecharnos, aunque en todas ellos no vimos sino tres o quatro
arcos ..."
This is translated as follows:
"And as they did not choose to give us the (two) Christians, and because we would not give them the Indians,
they began to throw stones at us with slings, and rods,
making gestures of shooting us with arrows, although
among them all we saw no more than three or four
bows ... "

As the Spanish verb tirar may mean either to throw or to
shoot, a sentence like the above need not repeat it. In other
words, the Indians began to throw stones with slings and
to shoot "rods", the latter obviously some special kind of
sticks, distinct from arrows. True arrows are implied in
the expression flecharnos, to "arrow us" or "shoot arrows
at us". While this passage is not exactly precise, that of the
historian Oviedo y Valdez, who wrote another account of
the Narvaez expedition after interviewing Cabeza de Vaca
in the court of Spain in the 1540's, is somewhat more so
though he omits any reference to slings and says that some
arrows were shot:

"... y comenzaron los indios
flechas .. .. "

a

(." ... the Indians began to

202

From these two accounts, it seems clear that the "rods"
were not arrows and that they were more important weapons
(at least at this time and place) than bows and arrows.
THE DE SOTO EXPEDITION
A much fuller and truly remarkable description of the
atlatl and "dart" occurs in the De Soto documents. Strangely
enough, the locality is almost the same as that in the foregoing references. After De Soto's death and the attempt
to reach Mexico overland under Luis de Moscoso had been
abandoned, the survivors returned to the Mississippi River
and built boats in which some of them eventually reached
Mexico. In July 1543, at a point only one-half league from
the river's mouth, a battle occurred which has been described
in detail by the Inoa GarcHaso de la Vega. Swanton (1938)
presents the original Spanish text and a translation which
is essentially accurate except for some changes in punctuation. I have inserted words in brackets in a few places; the
parentheses are Swanton's:
"One Spaniard was wounded by a weapon that the Castilians in the Indies call a tiradera (javelin), which we call
more accurately a bohordo because it is shot with a stock
( amiento) of wood or a cord. The Spaniards had not seen
this weapon in all the places they had visited in Florida
until that day. In Peru the Indians use it a great deal. It
is a weapon a fathom long made of a firm rush, though
spongy in the center, of which they also make arrows. They
make heads for them of deer horn, fashioned in all perfection with four points or harpoons of palm or other wood
that they have, as strong and heavy as iron. So that the
part of the arrow or dart [bohordo] made of the rush will
not be split by the barb when it hits its mark, they make
a knot where the head or harpoon joins it, and another one
at the other end, which the cross-bowmen call batalla on
their darts [virotes], where it receives the cord of the bow
or the stock with which they shoot it. The stock is of
wood two tercias long and they shoot the dart [b ohordo]
with it with extreme force, so that it has been known to
pass through a man armed with a coat of mail. The
Spaniards in Peru feared this weapon more than any other
the Indians had, for their arrows were not so terrible as
those of Florida.
"The dart [bohordo] or long arrow [tiradera] with
which they wounded our Spaniard of whom we are speaking had three barbs in the place of one, similar to the three
longest fingers of the hand. The barb in the center was
a hand-breadth longer than the two at the sides, and thus

Historic Survival of the Atlatl

203

it went through the thigh from one side to the other. The
two side barbs were lodged in the middle of the thigh
and in order to get them out it was necessary to cut away
a great deal of flesh from [make a great carnage of] the
poor Spaniard's leg, because they were harpoons [with
barbs] and not smooth points. The butchery was such
that he expired before they got his wound dressed, the
poor fellow not knowing whether to complain more of the
enemy who had wounded him or of the friends who had
hastened his death".

Varner and Varner (1951, pp. 596-598) have included
these passages in their complete translation of the Inca
Garcilaso's account of the De Soto expedition. Of the several points where their translation differs from Swanton's,
the following seem worth mentioning because they have
to do with the details of the atlatls and the missiles thrown
with them: the javelins or "darts".
(A) Where the Varners translate tiradera as "arrow",
Swanton's "javelin" and "long arrow" are undoubtedly
preferable.
(B) Where Swanton translates "They make heads for
them [the tiraderas or javelins] of deer horn, fashioned in
all perfection with four points or harpoons of palm or other
wood they have ... ", the Varners translate "As a head it
[the tiradera] bears the tip of a deer horn worked with the
utmost perfection on four sides, or a harpoon made from
palm or other available woods ... " In this case the Varners'
translation is preferable, for the Spanish has it that the
antler heads were worked on four corners or angles (de
cuatro esquinas)-certainly not on four "points", as Swanton has it. In other words, the antler heads must have been
square or rectangular in cross-section. The only other possibility is that they had four projecting barbs like harpoon
heads, but where Swanton omits the comma after "four
points", the Varners have this correct as "four sides, or a
harpoon ... ". Thus, the heads of the tiraderas or javelins
must either have had antler points worked down to a foursided shape or harpoon-like heads (with barbs?) made of
palm or "other available woods". Farther along (see E,
below), we learn that the missiles shot with the atlatl were
actually tridents, but there is no way to decide whether

204

Texas Archeological Society

anything but wooden harpoons with barbs ("not smooth")
were used on any of the three points of that particular
missile.
(C) Where Swanton gives the length of the "stock" or
throwing stick as two tercias without translating this word,
the Varners translate: "The strip is of wood two-thirds of a
yard in length ... ". From my own experience in handling
North American atlatls, both archeological and ethnological
in origin, and reading descriptions of them, I venture to
state that the majority run from about 20 to 24 inches in
length, which is agreeable with "two-thirds of a yard".
(D) Regarding the throwing implement, the amiento de
palo, o de cuerda, Swanton makes no comment, but the
Varners state in a footnote that: "An 'amiento' is a leather
strap which is customarily fastened to a javelin for the purpose of giving it more force when it is hurled and retrieving
it afterward. Since in his first reference the Inca speaks
of a 'strap' of wood or of cord, then later specifically states
that the 'amiento' is of wood, it is possible that he had in
mind something like a pliable vine or a piece of the bark of
certain types of trees. On the other hand, he could have
meant simply a strip of wood. In case of the latter, he
no doubt is picturing here the ancient atlatl .... ". We need
only add that the Inca himself said that the Spaniards had
never seen this weapon before that day in any part of
"Florida" through which they had traveled; and they recognized it as similar to the weapon which they knew and
feared so much more than the bow in Peru.
(E) According to the Swanton translation, the middle
member of the three harpoon points on the tiradera which
wounded the Spaniard was "a hand-breadth longer" than
the two at the sides; the Varners translate this as "a quarter
of a yard" longer. The original Spanish says only that the
middle member era una quarta mas largo. As the middle
"harpoon" went through the thigh while the two side members lodged within the thigh, a "hand-breadth" seems about
right.

Historic Survival of the Atlatl

205

An interesting clue is given as to the economic life of the
Indians who used the atlatl against the Spaniards. Thus,
in the events which lead up to the battle, we read in the
Varner translation as follows (p. 595):
" . . . and in the first of these canoes they beheld an
Indian very different in aspect and color from those they
had left inland, for he was as large as a Philistine and as
black as an Ethiopian. The cause of this exceptional
swarthiness in the coastal Indians is the salt water in which
they are continually fishing, for the land being very sterile,
they sustain themselves by this means. Furthermore, the
heat of the sun, which is more intense along the coast than
inland, contributes toward making them dark. Standing
in the prow of his canoe, this Indian shouted to the Castilians in a gross and pompous voice: 'Thieves, vagabonds
and loiterers who without honor or shame travel along this
coast disquieting its inhabitants, depart from this place immediately by one of the two mouths of the river, if you do
not want me to destroy you all and burn your ships ...".

Here is a definite implication that these particular people
were non-agricultural, "the land being sterile", and that
they existed largely if not entirely by fishing. I believe
that all the agricultural Indians of America had the bow
when discovered by European explorers, as well as almost
all of the non-agricultural ones. However, in this case there
may have been some connection between survival of the
atlatl and lack of agriculture.
The Inca's account also proves definitely that the De Soto
expedition managed to convey its pigs across the Mississippi
when they crossed this river and wandered in what is now
Arkansas and Louisiana; also that the pigs reproduced and
were kept by Indians. After the survivors had penetrated
as far, perhaps, as the Trinity River in Texas under Luis de
Moscoso, then returned to the Mississippi, the Inca states
(Varner translation, p. 530):
"Here at this stage, Alonso de Carmona, after telling at
length of the miseries and hardships of this journey, adds
that they came upon a sow which had been lost on their
trip out [i.e., the overland trip toward Mexico], and that
this animal had dropped thirteen pigs, all of which were
now large and marked on the ears, each with a different
mark. It must have been that the natives had distributed
these p igs among themselves and identified them with their
own particular signs, from which one may deduce that
this livestock has been preserved . . . . "

CONCLUSIONS
We may have been stretching things too far in attempting
to explain the hog skull from Lamar County in terms of
recorded survival of the atlatl in two localities, both near
the Mississippi River mouth, in the first half of the 16th
century. These localities are not only several hundred miles
from Lamar County, Texas, but the native cultures in the
two areas were quite different, and the "darts" or missiles
described above did not even have stone points. The last
factor probably has a geographical explanation, however,
because of the dearth of natural stone in the Mississippi
alluvial valley and delta.
The only fact that can be deduced under these circumstances is that the atlatl actually did survive in at least one
small section of the southeastern states in the 16th century.
We can, however, wonder whether it could not have survived for a time in other sections, particularly where the
earliest European explorations occurred as much as one or
two centuries later. In the Lamar County area, for example,
there is no known documentary material on the native tribes
until well into the 18th century, and even then the exact
locations are difficult to determine.
It cannot be proved, of course, that the large and heavy
projectile points commonly called "dart points", including
the Gary point found in the hog skull, were used exclusively
with missiles thrown with an atlatl; they may have been
used with powerful bows, or even on spears. On the other
hand, it does no harm to explore the possibility that atlatls
were still in use in the Lamar County area-and perhaps
other sections of the southeastern states-after European
hogs had been introduced by the De Soto expedition.

Whatever the best answer may be, the problem is
intriguing.
