ABSTRACT

HRA Gray & Pape, LLC, of Houston, Texas (HRA Gray & Pape), conducted an
archaeological assessment of 5.09 hectares (13.03 acres) of property at the behest of the
United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Galveston District. This investigation
was conducted in order to assess any impacts to properties under their jurisdiction that may
have been affected by previously completed construction activities. The project area is
located in a low-lying area between halls Bayou and Carancahua Bayou on the Sea Isle and
Hitchcock 7.5 minute United States Geological Survey (USGS) topographic quadrangle
maps.
An after-the-fact USACE permit was issued and archaeologist Thomas Oertling and
crew conducted the initial archeological study of the area in July of 2004. Mr. Oertlings’
investigations documented a potential prehistoric shell midden exposed on the ground
surface between the two excavated lakes. However, additional work was required by the
USACE to further clarify the character of this deposit and the project’s potential impacts.
Field investigation conducted by HRA Gray & Pape were carried out from April 6 to
April 7, 2006 and consisted of walkover, photo-documentation, judgmental shovel testing of
the project area, and the excavation of two 1- by 1-meter test units in the vicinity of the
potential shell midden.
During this investigation, shovel testing resulted in the observation of a single chert
flake on a pimple mound within the southern portion of the project area. The flake was
documented and returned to its location of origin. Due to the low-lying topography and
evidence of frequent inundation in the area, it was determined to be an isolated find possibly
deposited during a recent flood event. Investigation into the potential shell midden revealed
the presence of several modern materials including glass and rubber intermixed with a thin
layer of shell. Due to the commingling of materials, density of shell observed, and
surrounding marshy soils, it was determined that the shell has likely been washed in during a
recent flood event. HRA Gray & Pape recommends that no further archaeological work is
required.

CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTION

HRA Gray & Pape, LLC (HRA Gray & Pape), of Houston, Texas, performed an
archaeological assessment of 5.09 hectares (13.03 acres) of property in Galveston
County, Texas between Halls Bayou and Carancahua Bayou (Figures 1). Portions of the
project area had been modified prior to field survey. Therefore, this investigation was
conducted in order to complete requirements associated with an after-the-fact permit
application (permit number 23544) for the United States Corps of Engineers, (USACE)
Galveston District.

PROJECT BACKGROUND
This project was initiated at the behest of the USACE in order to assess the
potential for impacts to cultural resources located within properties under their
jurisdiction. Prior to the archaeological and historic properties site file research, the
subject tract had been modified extensively by dredging, excavation of two lakes, and the
filling of wetlands with spoil.
Between July 8 and 17, 2004, Archaeologist Thomas Oertling, M.A. and two field
assistants conducted an archaeological investigation within the property on behalf of the
USACE. During this time, a visual inspection of the area was conducted and a total of 17
shovel tests were excavated. In the area immediately south of the northernmost lake, Mr.
Oertling reported the presence of a small, potential prehistoric shell midden,
characterized by a small surface scatter of shell (Oertling 2005). Management
recommendations were not provided in his report of investigation.
The USACE permit area is shown in Oertling 2005 (Appendix A, pgs.5-6). The
work conducted by HRA Gray & Pape was a re-evaluation of three specific locations
within the original survey area and efforts were focused in the area of the shell scatter and
surrounding the two excavated lakes. The goals of this archaeological assessment were
to determine if previous construction activities had affected, and if continued, would
affect, any previously identified historic properties as defined by Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended (36 CFR 800).
Additionally, the survey was to establish whether or not previously

CHAPTER II. ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING OF THE PROJECT AREA

The following section provides a discussion of the published soil morphology in
the project area, followed by a discussion of field-verified soils and topography.

SOILS
Mapped soils within the project area consist of barrier island sand deposits
resulting from both eolian and fluvial processes. Two soils make up the project area.
These are Edna (Ed) and Narta fine sandy loam (Ns) (Crenwelge et al.1988).
Edna fine sandy loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes (Ed) is a nearly level, poorly drained
loamy soil found in upland areas with slopes averaging 0.2 percent. It is characterized by
a surface layer composed of dark gray fine sandy loam about 20.32 centimeters (8.00
inches) thick. This is followed by an upper layer that is medium acid, gray clay to a
depth of 66.04 centimeters (26 inches). The lower two layers are composed of neutral
light gray clay to moderately alkaline light brownish gray clay to a depth of 152.40
centimeters (60 inches) (Crenwelge et al.1981; Crenwelge et al.1988; Soil Survey Staff,
Natural Resources Conservation Service, United States Department of Agriculture [SSS
NRCS USDA] 2006).
Narta very fine sandy loam (Ns) is a nearly level, somewhat poorly drained loamy
soil above clayey subsoil. It is found on uplands along coastal marsh with slopes
averaging 0.3 percent. It is characterized by a surface layer of dark gray fine sandy loam
to a depth of 22.86 centimeters (9.00 inches) followed by a layer of very dark gray clay
12.70 centimeters (5.00 inches) thick. This is underlain by gray clay to a depth of 96.52
centimeters (38 inches), below which lies light gray clay to a depth of 152.40 centimeters
(60 inches) (Crenwelge et al.1988; SSS NRCS USDA 2006).
Field verification confirmed the presence of sandy loams and clayey deposits
associated with recent alluvium, however, the topographic position of these soils within
the project area was not situated in an upland area with slight slopes. Rather, the soils
encountered were positioned on low-lying topography within a floodplain characterized
by the presence of marine shell fragments and stratified parent material. This observation
is confirmed by detailed regional data collected by James Abbott (2001; pg. 21).
Another factor affecting field observation of soils includes the 1983 flood event
caused by Hurricane Alicia. Recent flooding of the project area by Hurricane Alicia was
confirmed during a conversation in the field with Mr. Willfred Peltier, who leases the
property for his cattle to graze on. While such an event is unusual, it may have been a
contributing factor to the contradiction between field observations and the USDA
documented soils and topography.

CHAPTER III. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

The archaeological investigations associated with the current undertaking were
designed to identify and record the existence of cultural resources, prehistoric and historic,
within the defined project boundaries. These objectives facilitated the collection of data
needed in order to determine whether additional investigations would be required to
evaluate the potential eligibility of any newly defined cultural resources for inclusion on the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or as a State Designated Landmark (SAL).

LITERATURE REVIEW AND SITE FILE RESEARCH STRATEGY
Site file research was initiated by consulting the Texas Archaeological Site Atlas,
an on-line research archive maintained by the Texas Historical Commission (THC). Site
file research showed that no previously recorded sites are located within 1.6 kilometers (1
mile) of the project area.

FIELD METHODOLOGY
The project area was divided into three main survey areas (Survey Areas A, B,
and C) based on proximity to each of the excavated lakes within the project area (Figure
2). Survey Area A included the area surrounding the southern lake and its banks, Survey
Area B included the area immediately surrounding the northern lake and its banks, while
Survey Area C was limited to an area that was proposed for excavation for wetland
mitigation and contained the surface scatter of shell immediately south of the northern
lake.
Archaeological methods employed consisted of pedestrian survey augmented by
judgmental shovel testing, a single auger test, and minimal test unit excavation in the area
of the surface scatter of shell. Shovel testing was conducted in all 3 survey areas, but in
Survey Areas A and B was limited to include only those locations of higher elevation
(pimple mounds) relative to the majority of the low-lying project area.
Shovel tests typically measured 30 centimeters (11.81 inches) in diameter and
were excavated to a maximum depth of 1 meter (3.28 feet), with an average depth of 40
centimeters (1.31 feet) into the underlying substratum or until Pleistocene clays were
encountered. Excavated soils were screened through ¼ -inch hardware cloth. Dense clay

and color followed standard terminology and the Munsell (2000) soil color charts.
Additional information concerning soils encountered was recorded on standardized shovel
test forms for each shovel test excavation. All shovel tests are included in Appendix A.
Unit excavation was restricted to the vicinity of the possible shell midden, in an
effort to understand the depositional nature of the area and to determine if the observed
shell material was a part of an intact midden or a natural deposit. Unit placement was
determined in field based on observed surface shell scatter and topographic
characteristics. Test units measured 1- by 1-meter (3- by 3-feet) in size and were excavated
stratigraphically with arbitrary levels. Arbitrary levels were excavated in 10 centimeter (4inch) increments or until a new stratum was encountered. When a new stratum was
encountered the arbitrary level was terminated and the new stratum uncovered completely.
At each new stratigraphic break new arbitrary levels were begun and continued until
additional strata were encountered or until the bottom of the arbitrary level was reached. All
test units were drawn and photographed in profile following completion of excavation.

CHAPTER IV. RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

Besides the potential shell midden, no previously unrecorded archaeological
resources were identified within the project APE. The results of the archaeological
investigation are provided in the following sections.

SURVEY AREA A
Survey Area A consists of the portion of the project area east of the southernmost
lake and the lake banks. This area measures approximately 4.64 hectares (11.46 acres)
and is located east of Halls Bayou ranging from approximately 120 meters (66 feet) east
to 300 meters (984 feet) east of the bayou. Ground visibility in this area ranged from
30% to 70% with low shrub and field grasses covering the remainder. The area is used as
cattle pasture and exhibited deep prints in the soil, an indication that the area has been
saturated in the past. It is composed of low-lying, frequently inundated land with only
two identifiable landforms. Nearly 100% of Survey Area A immediately surrounding the
southernmost lake is overlain by large dredged spoil mounds on the east side and a
graded gravel road on the west side (Figure 2; Plate1). This area is proposed for
inundation to facilitate creation of wetlands.
The eastern, southern, and northern sections of Survey Area A were visually
inspected along two transects spaced approximately 30 meters (98 feet) apart by
pedestrian survey and only shovel tested on two landforms (pimple mounds). A small
watercraft was used to visually inspect the banks of the lake where a walkover inspection
was not possible (Plate 2). The banks were carefully examined for the presence of any
cultural material. The western section of Survey Area A was visually inspected along an
adjacent gravel road. No cultural material was observed during the watercraft survey.
The entire area was documented with photographs.
Two shovel tests were excavated in Survey Area A in areas with slightly higher
elevation than the remainder of the low-lying project area. The first shovel test was
placed near the lower east side of the southern lake while the second was positioned on a
small rise within an artificial island near the northern end of this lake. Strata just below
the surface ranged from light brownish gray (10YR6/2) sandy silt to dark gray (10YR4/1)
sandy loam. Deeper strata were composed of brown sandy silt (10YR5/3) mottled with
brownish yellow (10YR6/6) sandy clay and dark gray (GLEY 1 4/N) to black (GLEY 1
2.5N) compact sandy clay with approximately 20% iron deposits (Figure 3).
The excavation of Shovel Test A1, located in the central portion of Survey Area A
approximately 70 meters (229.65 feet) east of the lake, resulted in the recovery of a single

chert flake at 36 centimeters (14.17 inches) below the surface followed by dense mottled
sandy clay (Appendix A). Shovel tests were not excavated in the cardinal directions in an
effort to delineate the potential extent of artifactual materials due to the observance of
mottled soil and otherwise low-lying topography, indicative of an area that is frequently
inundated. Due to the small size of the landform, mottled soils, and the surrounding lowlying topography, it was determined that the flake was an isolated find and its deposition
was likely the result of a recent flood event (Plates 1 and 2). This artifact was
documented in the field and not collected. Shovel Test A2 was excavated on the north
end of the southern lake on a small rise. Soils below 10 centimeters (4 inches) in this
shovel test contained iron deposits, an indicator that soils are frequently inundated. No
cultural resources were identified during the excavation of Shovel Test A2 (Figure 3).

SURVEY AREA B
Survey Area B consists of two areas along the western banks of the northernmost
lake in addition to the lake’s banks. This area measures approximately 0.48 hectares
(1.19 acres) and is located approximately 380 meters (1,247 feet) north of Halls Bayou.
Ground visibility ranged from 10% to 40% in this survey area. Vegetation observed
included medium-size marsh grasses in standing water and other low shrubs and field
grasses. The area is used as cattle pasture and exhibited numerous deep hoof prints in the
soil, an indication that the area has been saturated in the past. It is composed of lowlying, frequently inundated land with no visible landforms located within the project area.
Nearly 80% of Survey Area B immediately surrounding the manmade lake is disturbed
and consists of large dredged spoil mounds situated along both sides of the northern half
of the lake (Figure 2; Plate 3).
Survey Area B was visually inspected by pedestrian survey and only shovel tested
in one grassy area on the west side. Shovel Test B1 was placed approximately one meter
(3.28 feet) west of the bank of the northern lake. Excavation revealed significantly
disturbed soils with heavily mottling and high gravel content (Appendix A). The
observed disturbance is likely related to previous construction of the lake. No cultural
material was observed at the location of Shovel Test B1 or during the visual
reconnaissance of Survey Area B. The entire area was documented with photographs.

SURVEY AREA C
Survey Area C, a portion of the project area known to contain a surface scatter of
shell and described as a potential prehistoric shell midden by Oertling (2005), was also
examined (Plate 4). This 0.15-hectare (0.38 acre) area was visually inspected by
pedestrian survey augmented with shovel and auger testing and the excavation of two 1-x
1-meter (3.28 x 3.28-foot) test units. Work was primarily conducted within a 40-meter x
30-meter (131-foot x 98-foot) rectangular staked area approximately 10 meters (33 feet)

south of the northernmost lake and 340 meters (1,115 feet) north-northeast of Halls
Bayou (Figure 4). Ground visibility ranged from 10% to 90% in this survey area.
Vegetation observed included low shrubs and field grasses. The land is composed of
numerous eroding slopes on the southern, central, and eastern portions and exhibits a
higher elevation on the east side. It has been partially disturbed in the past as marked by
a small manmade drainage ditch on the west side and numerous small to medium-size
spoil mounds also on the west side. The area is used as cattle pasture and exhibited
numerous deep hoof prints in the soil near the drainage ditch, an indication that the area
has been saturated in the past.
A total of ten shovel tests (C1-C10) were excavated within the staked area of
investigation in Survey Area C (Appendix A). An auger test was performed at the base
of Shovel Test C5 to test for deeper features. All ten shovel tests were negative for
cultural resources, although a thin lens of shell mixed with modern cultural debris
including rubber, glass and ceramics, was observed approximately 5 centimeters (1.96
inches) below the ground surface in three shovel tests surrounding the surface scatter of
shell. Shovel testing in this area provided detailed information about the depths of soils
strata prior to the excavation of any test units.
Two test units measuring 1- by 1-meter (3- by 3-feet) in size were excavated in
arbitrary levels (Figure 5). Arbitrary levels were excavated in 10-centimeter (4-inch)
increments. Test Unit 1 (N135 E120) was excavated in the location of the most abundant
surface scatter of shell on top of an eroding slope. Test Unit 2 (N135 E110) was excavated
10 meters (33 feet) west of Test Unit 1 on a low-lying flat sandy area clear of vegetation.
The results of both these tests are detailed below.

TEST UNIT 1 (N135 E120)
The unit was situated so as to be above the buried shell, based on the presence of
exposed shell along a partially machine excavated ridge wall. A total of 10 artifacts of
modern origin were recovered from this unit. The majority of material consisted of intact
and fractured oyster shell valves occurring between 8 and 11 centimeters (3.15 to 4.33
inches) below datum. Mixed with this matrix were modern materials including four
pieces of window glass, one piece of bottle glass, two pieces of porcelain, and three
rubber fragments. Also found was one flint flake which was diagnosed in the field as a
fragment of road matrix. No additional materials were observed below a depth of 11
centimeters (4.33 inches). Soil throughout the unit was uniformly a brown (10YR 5/3) silt
loam from the surface to its termination at 30 centimeters (11.81 inches), or two arbitrary
levels below any cultural material.

TEST UNIT 2 (N135 E110)
The unit was situated on a low terrace, below the exposed shell involved in Unit
1. The unit contained fragmented shell and a single intact oyster shell occurring 4

sand loam to a depth of 6 centimeters (2.36 inches) below datum followed by mottled
brown (10YR 5/3) and black (10YR 2/1) sandy clay. This unit was terminated at 7
centimeters (2.76 inches) below datum upon reaching dense uniform black Pleistocene
clay.
Additional evidence supporting the interpretation that the shell material reflected
natural deposition was obtained during conversations with property leaser Mr. Willfred
Peltier. Mr. Peltier indicated that the whole area had been littered with debris resulting
from floods in 1983 associated with Hurricane Alicia (personal communication 2006).
Mr. Peltier further stated that Survey Area C and beyond had been covered by
approximately 1.52 meters (5 feet) of water during that time.

CHAPTER V. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

This report presents the findings of an archaeological assessment of 5.09 hectares
(13.03 acres) of property in Galveston County, Texas. The excavation of two long lakes
between Halls Bayou and Carancahua Bayou has heavily impacted property associated
with this project. Survey Areas A and B were investigated at the request of the USACE
in order to document any previously unidentified buried cultural resources and to clearly
assess any disturbance to cultural resources at and adjacent to the two excavated lakes.
Survey Area C was investigated at the request of the USACE to determine whether or not
a previously documented shell scatter on the surface had prehistoric cultural affiliation
and archaeological significance.
Site file research indicates that no previously recorded archaeological sites or
historic structures have been identified within or in proximity to the project area.
Field investigation consisted of visual surface inspection, shovel testing, and
minimal test unit excavation within the project area. Subsurface investigation included
the excavation of 13 shovel tests ranging between 5 and 100 centimeters (2 and 40
inches) below the surface. Shovel tests were excavated to a maximum depth of 1 meter
(3 feet) in sandy to clayey, intact soils. Due to the soil characteristics noted during shovel
testing and the low-lying marshy topography, the potential for deeply buried Holocene
soils was considered to be low, and therefore backhoe testing was not required.
During this investigation, shovel testing resulted in a single chert flake on a small
pimple mound within the southern portion of the project area. Due to the low-lying
topography, it is likely that the flake was deposited during a recent flood event. Due to
the evidence of frequent flooding within the area as marked by deep cattle imprints on the
ground surface and iron deposits in the soil, the flake was considered an isolated find and
returned to its point of origin. No other artifacts were encountered during the cultural
resources survey. Formal site recordation will not be completed in association with this
locus. It is the opinion of HRA Gray & Pape that no additional work is necessary within
this area.
Investigation into the potential shell midden revealed the presence of several
modern materials including glass, ceramics, and rubber intermixed with a thin layer of
highly fragmented shell. HRA Gray & Pape archaeologists did not record any evidence
of bone or lithic material in association with the shell as reported by Oertling (2005) to
suggest the presence of a shell midden. Furthermore, the shell observed during this
investigation did not present any distinction between old and freshly deposited shell, also
suggested by Oertling. The observed deposit is believed to be of natural origins based on
several factors. Shell contained within the deposit has good preservation, and the
shallow, extremely thin shell deposit depth (as little as 5 centimeters [1.97 inches] and

17

perhaps less) suggests recent deposition during a single flood episode occurring in 1983,
caused by Hurricane Alicia (verified through personal communication with Mr. Willfred
Peltier, land lessee). With few exceptions, the shell material was highly fragmented and
clear artifactual material such as worked lithics, faunal remains, or pottery were not
observed. Due to the commingling of modern materials, paucity of observed shell, and
surrounding marshy soils, it was determined that the shell has likely been washed in
during a recent flood event and does not represent cultural activity or artifactual material.
This interpretation is supported by the soils observed in the survey area, which
shows a uniform stratum of probable flood deposit both above and below the shell.
Additional evidence supporting the interpretation that the shell material reflected natural
deposition was obtained during conversations with property leaser Mr. Willfred Peltier.
HRA Gray & Pape recommends that no further archaeological work is required.
