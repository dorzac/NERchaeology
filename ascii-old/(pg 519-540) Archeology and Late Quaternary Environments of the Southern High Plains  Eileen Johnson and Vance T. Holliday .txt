Archeology and Late Quaternary Environments
of the Southern High Plains
Eileen Johnson and Vance T. Holliday

ABSTRACT
The Southern High Plains contains a rich record of Late Quaternary sedimentation and human occupation
spanning the past 12,000 years. The stratigraphic and cultura! records are best preserved in the three principal
loci of Late Quaternary deposition: draws, dunes, and playa basins. The best-known multiple-occupation sites
within good stratigraphic contexts are found in draws. This paper is a summary of the archeological and
paleoenvironmental record of the Southern High Plains. A model for the cultural sequence (Paleoindian,
Archaic, Ceramic, Protohistoric, and Historic) is based on the Lubbock Lake record, supported by data from
other sites. The paleoenvironmental sequence is based on region-wide investigations of paleontology, paleobotany, sedimentology, pedology, and geomorphology. The record is one of changing climatic, environmental,
and hydrological conditions, and the adjustments to those changes made by the peoples inhabiting the region.
The climate changed from one with reduced seasonal contrasts in the Late Pleistocene, with increased effective
precipitation, to a more seasonal climate in the Early Holocene, culminating in drought in the Middle Holocene.
The modern continental climate was established in the Late Holocene. Some of the cultural subdivisions coincide
with these changes and others do not. The cultural record spans at least the last 11,500 years and relects both the
various aboriginal and European peoples who inhabited the region. The aboriginal record is primarily that of
grasslands hunter-gatherers engaged in task-oriented economic pursuits and short-term residential activities.
These activities came to an end as Europeans begin to use the region from the 1860s onward.

INTRODUCTION
The Southern High Plains of northwestern
Texas and eastern New Mexico (Figure 1) contains
a rich record of human occupation and sedimentation spanning the past 12,000 years. The sediments,
a!ong with soils and paleontological and paleobotanical remains contained within them, provide evidence of the environmental history of the region.
Numerous prehistoric sites are located throughout
the Southern High Plains, including some of the
best-known Paleoindian sites in North America.
Most archeological sites are single-occupation localities or surface occurrences. Several multipleoccupation sites with good stratigraphic context
have been investigated to varying degrees. Early
investigators (e.g., Cotter 1937; Howard 1935;
Sellards 1952; Wendorf 1961; Wendorf and Hester
1975) focused on the stratigraphy, depositional environments, and paleoenvironments of deposits
older than about 8000 B.P. (Pateoindian-age), although these sites generally also contained younger
strata and cultural remains. These sites include:

Lubbock Lake (Johnson 1987a), Clovis (Blackwater
Draw Locality #1) (Hester 1972), Plainview
(Sellards et al. 1947), Marks Beach (Honea 1980),
and Lake Theo (Harrison and Killen 1978)
Among these sites that have long been of interest to archeologists, Lubbock Lake has undergone the most scrutiny with excavations throughout
its lengthy Late Quaternary record, producing the
most complete site-specific Late Quaternary archeological and environmental database in the region.
Geoarcheological work over the past 20 years
(Holliday 1985, 1993, 1995a; Holliday and Allen
1987) has produced a well-dated stratigraphic record
covering the last 12,000 years. This stratigraphic
record is complemented by detailed cultural and
zooarcheological records for the same time period
(Johnson 1987a, 1993, 1995a, 1995b; Johnson and
Holliday 1989). The Lubbock Lake records form
the database for modeling the regional culture history and its relationship to paleoenvironmental
change, supported by data from other sites.
This paper reviews the results of investigations
into the stratigraphy and cultural history of the

Southern High Plains, with supplementary data from
other Southern Plains sites immediately adjacent to
the region. The time period covered is the Late
Quaternary, from the latest Pleistocene through the
Holocene, and encompasses five major cultural
periods. Paleontological and geoscientific research
that began at Lubbock Lake has expanded to
encompass the entire region (Holliday 1989b,
1995b, 1995c; Johnson 1986a, 1986b, 1989a, 1991,
1994; Johnson and Shipman 1986, 1993; Johnson
et al. 1982, 1986, 1987). The Late Quaternary
paleoenvironments, therefore, are reconstructed
from a regional database with details from sitespecific records.

REGIONAL SETTING

The Southern High Plains (or Llano Estacado)
is an extensive plateau covering about 130,000 km2
and bounded by escarpments on the east, north, and
west. The southern portion of the High Plains surface grades into the Edwards Plateau (see Figure
1). The region has a virtually featureless, constructional surface formed by deposition of thick, widespread aeolian sediments (Blackwater Draw
Formation) during the Pleistocene (Reeves 1976;
Holliday 1989c, 1990). These sediments rest on
aeolian and alluvial deposits of the Ogallala Formation (Miocene-Pliocene), and locally on Pliocene

Johnson and Holliday ~ Archeology and Late Quaternary Environments

and Pleistocene lacustrine sediments (Reeves 1972;
Hawley et al. 1976; Caran 1991).
Slight topographic relief on the High Plains
surface is provided by small lake basins, dunes, and
dry valleys (Reeves 1972; Wendorf 1975; Hawley
et al. 1976; Holliday 1985a; Sabin and Holliday
1995). About 20,000 small (<5 km2) depressions
dot the landscape and contain seasonal lakes or
"playas." About 40 larger (tens of km2) basins, also
called "playas" or "salinas," are interspersed
throughout the region. The playa and salina basins
contain the only available surface water on the
Southern High Plains, although the water is seasonal and often brackish or saline. Lunettes (fringing dunes) often are found adjacent to the playas,
and several large sand dune fields are present along
the western Llano Estacado. The dry valleys or
"draws" are northwest-southeast trending tributaries of rivers on the Rolling Plains to the east (see
Figure 1). The Late Quaternary (post-Blackwater
Draw Formation) stratigraphic record of the Southern High Plains, containing the in situ archeological record, is found in draws, playas, salinas, and
dunes (Reeves 1972; Harbour 1975; Holliday
1985a, 1995b, 1995c).
The climate of the Southern High Plains is
continental and semi-arid (classified as BScDw), a
steppe with dry winters, mainly mesothermal years
(mean temperature of the coldest month is 32-64°
F) with occasional microthermal years (mean temperature of the coldest month is below 32° F)
(Russell 1945). Relatively uniform gradients in precipitation and temperature occur across the region;
precipitation generally increases from west to east,
and temperature usually increases from northwest
to southeast (Lotspeich and Everhart 1962; Cart
1967; Haragan 1983; Bomar 1983).
The historic vegetation of the Southern High
Plains is a mixed-prairie grassland, and the dominant
native plant community is short-grass (Blair 1950;
Lotspeich and Everhart 1962). Trees are absent
except along the escarpments and reentrant canyons.
Native plant communities of the region occur in
very few areas today, however, because most of the
Southern High Plains is under cultivation.
The Southern High Plains has low, even
environmental gradients, flat topography, and
uniform regional geology. These topographic and
geologic conditions prevailed throughout the Late
Quaternary, suggesting that past environments were
relatively uniform throughout the region and that

521

geomorphic responses to climate were similar and
synchronous. This situation, in turn, suggests that
long distance geological and paleoenvironmental
correlations can be made with some degree of
confidence.

CULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL
CHRONOLOGY
Five general cultural periods are recognized
for the Southern High Plains: Paleoindian (11,5008500 B.P.); Archaic (8500-2000 B.P.); Ceramic
(2000 B.P. to ca. A.D. 1450); Protohistoric (ca.
A.D. 1450-1650); and Historic (ca. A.D. 16501940s). The Paleoindian period covers the transition from the latest Pleistocene to the earliest
Holocene when now-extinct mammals were hunted
by people. The Archaic, from the later Early Holocene into the Late Holocene, is characterized by
evidence for systematic incorporation of plant use
in the subsistence base. The Ceramic period, in the
Late Holocene, is marked by the presence of both
ceramic artifacts and arrowpoints. The Protohistoric
period covers the time when Europeans were in the
region, but their influence was not manifested in
the aboriginal material culture nor in the archeological record. The Historic period is denoted by
European material culture in the archeological
record, and includes both aboriginal and AngloEuropean occupations.
The timing of the three major environmental
periods under discussion for the Southern High
Plains is based on geological and geomorphological work of the junior author (Holliday 1985a,
1985c, 1989a, 1995b, 1995c). The latest Pleistocene
and Early Holocene are presented as a combined
period covering the time from 12,000 to 7500 B.P.,
while the Middle Holocene dates from 7500 to 4500
B.P., and the Late Holocene dates from post-4500
B.P. The boundary between the Early and Middle
Holocene previously was set at 6500 B.P. (e.g.,
Johnson and Holliday 1993), based on the Lubbock
Lake record. Regional stratigraphic and paleoenvironmental studies have revised the age of the
boundary to 7500 B.P. (Holliday 1995c). The
boundaries for some of the environmental subdivisions sometimes crosscut the cultural divisions. Environmental reconstructions for these periods are
based on paleontological, sedimentologicat, pedological, and geomorphic data sets.

Pre-Clovis Period
The existence of a pre-Clovis period is a subject of intense debate (e.g., Dincauze 1984; Lynch
1990; Bryan 1978, 1986; Dillehay and Meltzer
1991), focusing on the issues of when people entered the New World and the type of archeological
evidence considered acceptable for pre-Clovis occupations. This period generally is considered to
date to the Late Wisconsinan, from around 25,000
to 11,500 B.P. (e.g., West 1983; Johnson 1991).
Currently, cultural subdivisions are not recognized,
as the few purported pre-Clovis sites come from
widely disparate times and locations throughout the
New World (West 1983).
Very little is known about the environment for
the period 25,000 to 11,500 B.P. on the Southern
High Plains (Johnson 1991). An equitable, humid,
maritime-like climate occurred over the Southern
Plains, with cool summers, mild winters, and
abundant precipitation (Lundelius et al. 1983;
Johnson 1993). Significant areas of open grassland
environments existed on the Southern Plains,
including parklands and savannas (Lundelius et al.
1983; Bryant 1977). Limited evidence from pollen
and stable carbon isotopes suggest that during this
time, the environment may have fluctuated between
cool-moist and cool-dry conditions (Hall and
Valastro 1995; Holliday 1995c).
Currently, only one site has materials that may
date to this uncertain period. At Lubbock Lake (see
Figure 1), two Late Pleistocene occupation levels
occur, the younger of Clovis-age, and the older still
undated. Geologic evidence, and the age of the
younger cultural level, indicate an age of >11,100
B.P. (Holliday and Johnson t984; Johnson and
Holliday 1985). The bone bed contains the remains
of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cut lines
occur on various elements from these species, and
those on the bison remains were confirmed by
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis
(Johnson and Shipman 1986; Johnson 1989). The
remains are found on a gravel terrace above the
Clovis-age stream bed, and could represent either
early Clovis activities or an occupation from the
pre-Clovis period. Additional work needs to focus
on the depositional context of the materials, and
dating, before any further claims of a pre-Clovis
period occupation are made. Alexander (1978:21)
suggests that "middle or early Pleistocene" artifacts
were found at Lubbock Lake. However, this
statement is based on a misinterpretation of the

stratigraphy, as Holocene artifacts were mixed into
much older Pleistocene lake beds.
Paleoindian Period
The Paleoindian period is subdivided on the
basis of distinctive projectile point types
(Wormington 1957; Wheat 1972; Frison 1991,
1993) representing cultures that consistently have
tightly-clustered radiocarbon ages and discrete time
periods. On the Southern Plains, the Paleoindian
period is subdivided into the Clovis (11,500 to
11,000 B.P.), Folsom (10,800 to 10,300 B.P.),
Ptainview (ca. 10,000 B.P.), and Firstview (ca. 8600
B.P.) cultures.
The Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene sediments of most archeological significance are found
in the draws that cross the region (see Figure 1).
The draws developed during the Pleistocene, probably the result of repeated cutting and filling, but
their origin and chronology are poorly known
(Holliday 1995b, 1995c). The oldest dated alluvial
sediments are 12,000 to 11,000 years old. During
this time, bedded sand and gravel was deposited in
most draws, indicative of competent streams flowing in the drainages (Holliday 1995b, 1995c). Water ceased to flow, and lacustrine deposition, in the
form of diatomite and sapropelic mud, began
abruptly about 11,000 B.P. in some reaches in a
number of draws. Otherwise, the streams continued
to flow until about 9500 B.P. (Holliday 1995b,
1995c).
During the Clovis period, an equitable, humid,
maritime paleoclimate existed with a lower mean
annual temperature than today; there also were
cooler summers and warmer winters that lacked
extended freezing conditions (Johnson 1986a,
1987c). Open grassland environments (mixed-grass
prairie) existed on the uplands with parklands along
the draws. Low gradient streams, with emergent
vegetation and sedge beds along the banks, meandered through the draws. Mean annual temperature
was about 10°-13°C (Johnson 1986a, 1987c) compared to 15°C today (Haragan 1983; Bomar 1983).
A lowered summer temperature by at least 5.6° C
existed with a winter temperature at or above 0° C
(Johnson 1986a, 1987c). A winter rainfall pattern
may have existed, coupled with cool, dry summers.
These climatic conditions produced more effective
moisture, lower evaporation rate, and greater humidity than today.

Johnson and Holliday ~ Archeology and Late Quaternary Environments

Three sites on the Southern High Plains (see
Figure 1) have yielded evidence of Clovis-age occupation. At Blackwater Draw Locality #1 (Hester
1972; Haynes 1995), the most extensive occupation
studied was along the northern edge of the
paleobasin, and involved at least five mammoth
that represented individual kill or scavenging
events (Saunders 1980). Remains from horse,
camel, and bison recovered during excavations of
the mammoth exhibited cut lines, dynamic impact
features, and evidence of tool use (E. Hughes 1984;
Johnson 1989a). Two worked sections of mammoth tusk also were recovered from the general
area of the E1 Llano Dig #1 excavations (Saunders
et al. 1990, 1991). Radiocarbon assays from carbonized plants in the sediments surrounding the
mammoths yielded ages of 11,040, 11,170, and
11,630 B.P. (Hester 1972). Near the southern end
of the South Pit, Cotter’s (1937) excavation revealed two mammoth that had been scavenged by
Clovis peoples (Saunders and Daeschler 1994).
Jelinek’s (1956) excavation in an area between the
North and South pits yielded the partial, remains of
a mammoth and four bison that represented different events, most likely scavenging by people. Organic sediments taken from around the jacketed
mammoth skull yielded an age of 10,780 B.P.
(Johnson and Holliday 1995). Several Clovis points
from this site were resharpened and reused as
butchering tools (Johnson 1991).
At Miami (Sellards t938), the remains of five
mammoth (three adults and two juveniles) were
found in sediments filling a playa-lake basin. While
Saunders (1980:94) interpreted the site as a single
kill event based on the age profile of the mammoth,
Holliday et al. (1994) offered alternative interpretations, including scavenging by Clovis peoples.
Marks on the ribs that appeared to be hack marks
from butchering could not be confirmed by SEM
analysis because of cortical surface erosion (Johnson
and Shipman 1986). Long bones were not fractured
(Johnson 1989a). Radiocarbon dates bracketed the
Miami bone bed between 11,400 and 10,800 B.P.
(Holliday et al. 1994). Clovis points from Miami
were resharpened and used as butchering tools
(Johnson 1991).
The Late Pleistocene occupation level at Lubbock Lake dates to 11,100 B.P. (Holliday et al.
1983). At least six species of megafauna were processed, with their remains exhibiting cut lines, helical fracture surfaces, dynamic loading points, and

523

evidence of tool use (Johnson 1985, 1987b, 1995;
Johnson and Holliday 1985; Johnson and Shipman
1986). Fractured mammoth limb elements were recovered associated with two large caliche boulders.
Mid-diaphyseal impact was used to fracture the
humerus and produce radial diaphyseal segments
(Johnson 1985). Modified lithic tools were absent,
although a Clovis point was recovered from the
bone bed during dredging operations that uncovered the site. The point was resharpened and used
as a butchering tool (Johnson 1991; Johnson and
Holliday 1987).
Post-depositional disturbance to the bone bed
had occurred, and bone orientation data (Kreutzer
1988) showed that bones were realigned; the stream
velocity and competency data indicated, however,
that neither the large caliche boulders nor the
megafaunal limb elements could have been transported in by the stream (Kreutzer 1986; Johnson et
al. 1987). Stream velocity and competency data
were based on grain size analysis of sediment
samples, and these demonstrated that the stream
was competent to transport particles no larger than
2 cm (Kreutzer 1986). Kreutzer’s (1986, 1988)
analysis further demonstrated an orientation of
bones by fluvial action, but did not demonstrate
transport or, therefore, secondary context. Johnson
(1995a), in a more detailed analysis of all in situ
bones, demonstrated that the bone bed comprising
the Clovis-age megafaunal processing station was
in primary context, and that transport did not occur
although the bones were realigned. Furthermore,
discrete cultural activity areas still were discernible. Carnivore disturbance was minimal, as less
than 3 percent of the total bone assemblage was
affected by carnivore modification.
The C!ovis-Folsom transition (ca. 11,000 B.P.)
on the Southern High Plains was a time of significant climatic and environmental change that continued into Late Paleoindian times (Johnson 1986a,
1987c; Lundelius et al. 1983; Holliday, 1995b,
1995c). An accelerated warming trend, greater seasonality, increased annual temperature fluctuation,
and wide-spread extinctions denote this transition.
Higher mean annual temperatures and warmer summers prevailed over the preceding period. Winter
temperatures were lower with sustained belowfreezing periods. Minimum and maximum temperatures fluctuated near 21° C from highs greater than
32° C to lows be!ow 0° C (Johnson 1986a, 1987c).
These conditions reflect a less equitable climate

524

than in the previous period, but one still more ameliorated than today. Perennial streams still existed
in some reaches of the lower draws, but extensive
freshwater, clear ponds with weedy growth, were
in the valley axes in upper reaches. Water levels in
these ponds fluctuated; the water was centimeters
to meters deep or it was at or below the surface,
exposing the floor of the draw. The mixed grasslands habitat became dominant with scattered deciduous trees on the draw slopes and around the
ponds. Wet meadow grasses and sedge beds around
the ponds graded into better-drained mixed grasslands along the valley floor. By 10,000 B.P., many
of the streams ceased to flow and the ponds evolved
into muddy marshes. On the uplands, playas and
salinas continued to have seasonal, if not perennial,
freshwater. Localized sand sheets formed in lowland settings, indicating a regional reduction in vegetative cover. This reduction most likely was the
result of drying, reflecting the waning stages of
pluvial conditions.
Four Folsom sites in good stratigraphic context are known for the region. At Blackwater Draw
Locality #1 (Hester, 1972), a series of small herds
of bison were killed and butchered around the
ponded spring waters. Radiocarbon ages date these
kills between 10,900-10,200 B.P. (Hester 1972;
Haynes 1995). Just off the Southern High Plains to
the northeast, Lipscomb (Barbour and Schultz 1941)
and Lake Theo (Harrison and Killen 1978) appear
to represent Folsom kills of larger herds of bison.
At Lake Theo (Harrison and Killen 1978), at least
12 to 14 bison were killed and butchered. An apparent camping area was associated with the bison
kill. Bone butchering tools were not recognized but
expedient lithic flake tools were common. However, little else is known about Lake Theo.
Lipscomb (Hofman 1991; Hofman and Todd
1990; Hofman et al. 1989, 1991; Todd et al. 1990)
appears to be a single-event, large-scale kill of at
least 55 bison that took place in the late summer or
fall. Of the skeletally mature animals, the sex ration is 3:1 females to males. Topographic setting
still is unclear although the bone bed was adjacent
to a 2 m-deep arroyo that existed at the time.
Butchering of the carcasses appears limited, with
many still fully articulated. Carnivore damage is
limited and the bone bed appears to have been
buried soon after the event. Some of the Folsom
points have been reworked to extend their usefulness (Hofman 1992). Lipscomb now represents the

largest single-event Folsom kill known for the
Southern Plains.
At Lubbock Lake, Folsom occupations are represented by a series of bison kills around the marshy
edges of ponds. Each kill was of a small cow-calf
herd, and the animals were butchered on the spot
using both expedient lithic and bone butchering tools
(Johnson and Holliday 1987; Johnson 1987b). Bones
from an individual carcass were stacked in small
piles representing butchering units. Lithic tools were
either retouched or utilized amorphous flakes. Production of the bone butchering tools took place in
the kill area and the debris and tools were discarded
at the locale when the tasks were finished (Johnson
1985). Folsom points were refashioned and also
resharpened for use as butchering tools (Johnson
and Holliday 1987). Based on one kill analyzed for
seasonality data, kills took place in the late fallearly winter (Johnson 1987c). The Lubbock Lake
Folsom occupation is radiocarbon dated between
10,800 to 10,300 B.P. (Holliday et al. 1983, 1985).
Four Plainview sites in good stratigraphic
context are known for the region (see Figure 1). At
the Plainview site (Sellards et al. 1947), the type
locality, a thick bone bed was embedded in pond
deposits in an abandoned stream channel in Running
Water Draw. The bone bed represented at least two
large-scale kill events that totaled over 100 bison.
One event took place in the spring while the other
was in the early fall (Johnson 1989a). The lithic
tool kit consisted primarily of Plainview projectile
points (refashioned into butchering knives) with a
few amorphous flake tools (Knudson 1983); bone
butchering tools were not recognized. Two
radiocarbon assays on bone yielded ages of 10,200
B.P. and 9860 B.P. (Speer 1986). Testing at Lake
Theo (Harrison and Killen t978) yielded Plainview
projectile points and other lithic tools and flakes in
place stratigraphically above the Folsom occupation.
Little else is known about the nature of occupation.
A radiocarbon assay on soil humates yielded an age
of 9950 B.P. (Johnson et al. 1982), while assays on
bone yielded ages of 9360 B.P. and 8010 B.P.
(Harrison and Killen 1978)
At Ryan’s site (Johnson et al. 1987; Hartwell
1991, 1995; Hartwell et al. 1989), Plainview points,
large bifaces, and large flakes were found within
lacustrine deposits of a very small, extinct playa
that overlooked Yellowhouse Draw. The morphology of the points ranged from pristine to reworked.
The lineal distribution, and damage and breakage

Johnson and Holliday ~ Archeology and Late Quaternary Environments
patterns (cf. Mallouf 1982), indicated plow-disturbed material that appears to have represented a
cache.
The Plainview occupation at Lubbock Lake is
characterized by the continuation of kills of small
herds of bison around the marshy edges of ponds,
the clus.tering or grouping of bones in distinct concentrations, and a change in weaponry design and
the technology to produce the new design. The
practice continued of resharpening and reusing the
points as butchering tools. The lithic tool kit was
complemented by a bone butchering tool kit made
from the bison being processed in the locales. The
Plainview occupation at the site is radiocarbon
dated to 10,000 B.P. (Johnson and Holliday 1980).
Testing at Mark’s Beach (Honea 1980) uncovered an apparent bison kill of Plainview age. Disarticulated remains from a bison were found in
lacustrine deposits. Neither lithic nor bone tools
were recovered, but a radiocarbon assay on bone
yielded an age of 9920 B.P. (Honea, 1980), and a
sample of soil humates was dated at ca. 9710 B.P.
(Holliday 1995c).
By the time of the Firstview occupation of the
Southern High Plains, the Early Holocene warming
and drying trend was intensifying. Effective
precipitation was decreasing with a shift away from
the previously established rainfall pattern, and
maximum summer temperatures were rising.
Periodic summer droughts and disappearing surfacewater resources denoted the end of the pluvial period
and the beginning of the trend toward modern
climatic conditions. Seasonality was more strongly
expressed with greater seasonal temperature
fluctuations, decreasing rainfall, and lowered
humidity. A scrub-grasslands, transitional from a
mixed-prairie to a desert-plains grasslands,
dominated the draws while the uplands probably
were a short-grass prairie. Alkaline marshes began
to dominate the floors of the draws (Holliday
1995c). Locally, valley-axis wet meadowsfreshwater marshlands with emergent vegetation and
sedge beds were available, grading into betterdrained valley floors and margins with mixed-grass
prairie (Johnson 1986a, 1987c; Holliday 1995c).
These hydrologic changes resulted from warming
of water, and from a reduction in effective
precipitation that decreased the discharge of springs
and seeps (Holliday 1995c). Deposition of aeolian
sediments in the draws, and as dunes on the uplands,
increasingly became more common. Playas and

525

salinas held seasonal water as well as locally
accumulated aeolian sediment.
Three Firstview sites have been excavated in
the region (see Figure 1). At Clovis (Hester 1972),
Firstview occupations are from the carbonaceous
silts (Unit E [Haynes 1975, 1995]), but the stratigraphic and geochronological situation of the material is not clear. Only a few radiocarbon ages are
available from this unit, but at most, it spans the
period from ca. 10,500 to 8500 B.P. (Haynes 1995).
Little information is available on excavated activity
areas within the carbonaceous silts. At least three
bison kill/butchering locales were excavated, two
in the lower part of the silts and one in the upper
part (Hester 1972; Agogino et al. 1976), while a
possible fourth locale is mentioned by Agogino and
Rovner (1969).
At Station E along the northwestern edge of
the South Pit, Evans (Sellards 1952) uncovered a
large bone bed in the upper silts containing the
remains of numerous bison in association with a
suite of projectile points and amorphous lithic flake
tools (Hester 1972). Sellards (1952) based his
Portales Complex on this suite of projectile points.
Bones were jumbled and the deposit may have been
trampled. At least three episodes of surface weathering are evident on the elements, indicating more
than one kill event (Johnson 1986b; Johnson and
Holliday 1995). Radiocarbon assays on organic
sediments taken from jacketed bone blocks yielded
ages of 8970 B.P. (bone block #1) and 8690 B.P.
(bone block #2) that did not overlap at two-sigma
(Johnson and Holliday 1995). These dates fall
within the age range for Firstview on the Southern
High Plains (Johnson and Holliday 1981; Johnson
1987a), and indicate that the bone bed represents
at least two Firstview occupational events. Wheat
(1972) reexamined the projectile points and concluded that most were resharpened variants of the
Firstview design.
San Jon (Roberts 1942), on the northwestern
edge of the Southern High Plains (see Figure 1),
was a stratified, multi-component site where cultural activities took place along the edge of a playa
basin. The "San Jon" bone bed in Area II yielded a
minimum of five bison, and articulated limb elements, particularly lower limbs, were common. Presumably, this bone bed represented a small-scale
bison kill at the edge of the playa. The one projectile point recovered from the bone bed was the type
specimen for the San Jon point (Roberts 1942), and

526

its tip was reworked (Hill et al. 1995). Wheat (1972)
subsumed the San Jon type into his Firstview type.
Organic sediments from within the bone bed yielded
an age of ca. 8360 B.P. (Hill et al. 1995).
At Lubbock Lake, Firstview peoples continued to hunt and butcher small herds of bison at the
edge of the marshlands (Johnson and Holliday
1981). Bone concentrations and the stacking of elements continued. Bone fracturing was minimal and,
therefore, bone tool manufacture and use was reduced and marrow processing was rare. The amorphous lithic flake tools were common, and Firstview
points were resharpened and reused as butchering
tools. The Firstview occupation at Lubbock Lake
was radiocarbon dated to 8600 B.P. (Holliday et al.
1983, 1985).

Archaic Period
In the Early Archaic, during the latter part of
the Early Holocene, available moisture and humidity levels continued to decrease, reflecting the intensification of the warming and drying trend, and
more marked seasonality. By the end of the Early
Holocene, hard-water, alkaline marshes, localized
desiccation, and aeolian sedimentation characterized deposition in the draws (Holliday 1989b,
1995b, 1995c). Marshes that persisted in the valley
axes were surrounded by a treeless mixed-grass
prairie. Sedge beds and wet meadows were absent.
On the uplands, aeolian sediments accumulated as
sand dunes, in lunettes, and in playa basins as a
result of reduced vegetation cover and wind deflation of the High Plains surface brought on by
drought.
Little is known about the Early Archaic, and
Lubbock Lake (Figure 2) is the only excavated site
for this time period. The practice of hunting and
butchering small herds of bison continued. A bone
concentration representing several individual bison
consisted of articulated to semiarticulated segments
indicating butchering units. None of the elements
were broken for marrow. Neither lithic nor bone
butchering tools were recovered, although numerous resharpening flakes indicated the use of several
lithic tools. Radiocarbon ages on soil humates date
the Early Archaic activity to ca. 8000 B.P. (Johnson
and Holliday 1989).
Although not excavated, an Early Archaic
bison bone bed dated to ca. 7600 B.P. occurs
stratigraphically above the Firstview bison bone

bed at San Jon in Area II (Hill et al. 1995). The two
projectile points recovered from the bone bed have
not been identified as to type, however (Hill et al.
1995). This bone bed around the playa basin
potentially represents the second known Early
Archaic bison kill for the region.
By about 6000 B.P., the lakes and marshes in
the draws had left significant accumulations of marl,
but the dominant sediment across the region, in and
out of the draws, was wind-blown material (Holliday
1989b, 1995b, 1995c). Aeolian sedimentation was
episodic but widespread from 9000 until 5500 B.P.,
with most areas affected by 6500 B.P. Between
5500 and 4500 B.P., aeolian sedimentation occurred
throughout the Southern High Plains. This aeolian
sedimentation culminated in significant filling of
draws, construction of sand dunes, local sedimentation in playa basins, and additions to lunettes
throughout the region. This aeolian activity marked
peak aridity in the Late Quaternary and the period
between 6500 and 4500 B.P. is known as the
Altithermal (Holliday 1989b).
The Altithermal coincides with the Middle Archaic period. Conditions were hot, dry, and dusty
(Holliday t989a; Johnson and Holliday 1986). The
massive aeolian sedimentation that occurred indicates further reduction in vegetation cover probably due to increased temperatures and decreasing
effective moisture in the form of lower effective
precipitation. Dental abnormalities in bison at this
time indicate poor range conditions due to excess
grit on the vegetation. The presence of yellowfaced gophers denotes semiarid to arid conditions
(Johnson 1987c; Johnson and Holliday 1986). Open,
treeless grasslands covered the valleys and available surface water decreased greatly. Given the climatic conditions derived from geologic and faunal
evidence, a desert-plains grasslands probably occurred on the Southern High Plains during the
Middle Archaic.
Excavated Middle Archaic materials in good
stratigraphic context are documented at five sites
(see Figure 2). Three sites yielded evidence for the
excavation of wells by prehistoric occupants in the
Middle Holocene. At Blackwater Draw Locality #1
(Evans 1951; Green 1962), at least 19 wells are
known. At Mustang Springs (Meltzer 1991; Meltzer
and Collins 1987), dozens of wells were discovered.
Excavations at Mark’s Beach (Honea 1980) exposed
a purported well. A hearth and associated Clear
Fork gouge were recovered in Middle Archaic

Johnson and Holliday n Archeology and Late Quaternary Environments
context from substratum 4A at 41LU26 (Bandy et
al. 1981). Although this material was undated,
substratum 4A at Lubbock Lake, less than 1 km
upstream, dated from 5500 to 5000 B.P. (Johnson
and Holliday 1986).
Despite the harsh conditions, relatively intensive occ.upation continued throughout this period at
Lubbock Lake. At least 28 activity areas are known
that include: camping events, bison kill/butchering
locales, and a large oven probably used for vegetal

Llano

5:27

processing (Johnson and Holliday 1986). The oven
is a large oval basin filled with ash, and capped by
a layer of burned caliche cobbles. A broken, worn
sandstone metate was found in the rock covering.
This feature was radiocarbon dated to ca. 4800 B.P.
(Johnson and Holliday 1986).
Little deposition or erosion occurred during
much of the Late Holocene and, as a result, the
Middle Holocene sediments often are modified
strongly by pedogensis. Some local deposition

occurred within the last several thousand years.
Late Holocene marsh sediments appear to be
common along the floors of the draws (Holliday
1985b, 1995b, 1995c). The most recent period of
aeolian sedimentation in the large dune fields and
lunettes appear to be less than 2,000 years old
(Holliday 1995b, 1995c; Haynes 1975, 1995).
Localized, relatively short term drought is suggested
by the varied occurrences of aeolian sediment.
By 4500 B.P., the climate began to ameliorate
and return to cooler and morn moist conditions that
brought about landscape stability and environmental changes that generally have persisted into modern times. Sedimentation ceased, little wind erosion
occurred, and a stable vegetation cover returned.
Formation of the Lubbock Lake Soil at Lubbock
Lake and similar soils at other localities (Holliday
1985b, 1990, 1995b, 1995c) occurred. This landscape stability heralded the establishment of essentially modern conditions and continental climate.
Range conditions improved, and a mixed grass prairie replaced the probable desert-plains grasslands
of the Middle Holocene, both in the draws and on
the uplands. Localized marshlands returned to the
valley axes with a resurgence of springs; occasional
hardwood trees were found in the draws. On the
uplands, playas and salinas held seasonal to yearround water (Holliday 1995b, 1995c). More extensive surface water was available, indicating more
available and effective moisture.
Only three sites in the region have Late Archaic materials within good stratigraphic context
(see Figure 2). The "lower midden zone" at Chalk
Hollow (Wedet 1975) is composed of three occupations dating between ca. 3800-2200 B.P. (Lintz
1995). These deposits, with corner and side-notched
Late Archaic points, represent camps for hunters
pursuing bison herds (Lintz 1995).
At San Jon in Area III, Roberts (1942)
excavated a Late Archaic bison kill, the only
excavated bison kill site for this time period on the
Southern High Plains. A minimum of seven bison
were killed and butchered at the edge of the playa.
Based on the bone bed distribution map (Hill et al.
1995:Figure 7), skulls and mandibles were common,
some articulated limb and vertebral units occurred
presumably representing butchering units, and bones
or articulated units were disassociated from each
carcass. Organic sediments from the substratum in
which the bone bed occurs yielded an age of ca.
3600 B.P. (Hill et al. 1995). The two projectile

points associated with the bone bed were not
identified as to type (Hill et al. 1995).
At Lubbock Lake, the Late Archaic is represented by at least nine occupation surfaces found
buried within the A-horizon of the Lubbock Lake
Soi!. These surfaces are denoted by scattered burned
caliche (from disturbed hearths), broken lithic tools,
and both diffuse and concentrated lithic flaking debris. These activities appear to represent camping
events. Diagnostic artifacts have not been recovered with the occupation surfaces, but a Late Archaic age is based on stratigraphic position and
radiocarbon ages associated with the stratigraphic
unit (Holliday !985a; Holliday et al. 1983, 1985).
Because this A-horizon represents a stable land surface that existed well into the Ceramic period, Late
Archaic and Ceramic-age materials may be mixed
in the uppermost occupation surfaces. A Late Archaic hearth has been excavated at 41LU29
(Johnson 1989b), on the eastern rim of Yellowhouse
Draw overlooking Lubbock Lake, and a Late Archaic-age cache was recovered from 41LU6 in
Yellowhouse Draw less than 1 km upstream from
Lubbock Lake (Buchanan 1995)
Archaic-age deposits have been investigated
in the Justiceburg Reservoir (Lake Alan Henry)
area on the Double Mountain Fork of the Brazos
River, downstream from Lubbock Lake ca. 97 km.
This area is located in the same drainage system as
Lubbock Lake and is just off the Southern High
Plains, southeast of Lubbock, on the Rolling Plains.
Most sites are in geologically unstratified deposits
(Boyd et al. 1989, 1990). Site types identified
include campsites, rockshelters, bison processing
stations or kill sites, and lithic procurement sites.
At least six sites (41GR207, 41GR287, 41GR376,
41GR383, 41GR456, and 41KT49) have been
identified as Archaic, and another six as Late
Archaic in age (41GR471, 41KT33, 41KT34,
41KT52, 41KT53, and 41KT151) based on
excavated features (primarily hearths), radiocarbon
ages, and artifact types (Boyd et al. 1990).

Ceramic Period
Ameliorated conditions continued until about
2,000 years ago when a pattern of episodic drought
began that continues today. This episodic pattern
indicates minor departures towards some aridity
through increased temperatures and decreased
effective moisture. Regionally, the details of this

Johnson and Holliday ~ Archeology and Late Quaterna~2 Environ~nents
episodic pattern are not clear. Although these
droughts appear not to have been severe enough to
alter the modern Southern Plains faunal
communities, they are severe enough to cause
vegetation denuding and surface erosion that led to
deposition and alteration of the landscape (Holliday
1985a, 1990; Johnson 1987b).
However, a range change occurs with one
mammalian community member that has been used
as an environmental indicator. Between 1830-1240
B.P., the pine vole (Microtus ochrogaster)
reestablishes itself on the northern portion of the
Southern High Plains (Willey and Hughes 1978),
reflecting the ameliorated, more mesic conditions
that prevailed after 4500 B.P. during the Late
Archaic and early Ceramic periods. After 1240 B.P.,
Microtus ochrogaster no longer ranged onto the
Southern High Plains. The periodic droughts
progressively are less severe, or of less duration, or
both. Coincident aeolian activity in the dune fields
record the same events (Holliday 1985b, 1995b,
1995c). Limited stable isotope data support drier
conditions on the Southern High Plains within the
last 1,000 years (Holliday 1995b, 1995c).
In upper reaches of the draws without spring
activity during this time, slopewash and aeolian
sedimentation occurred. But in the lower reaches, a
spring-fed stream and wet meadow-marshland complex existed along valley axes for the past 1,000
years (Holliday 1985a, 1995b, t995c). Hackberry,
native walnut, and mesquite grew along the valley
floor and slopes. The local environs were those of a
mesquite savanna surrounding a riparian marshland
complex (Johnson 1987c).
The earlier part of the Ceramic (ca. 2000 to
1000 B.P.) period appears to have been one of
transition from traditional Archaic lifeways--denoted by the retention of Archaic point designs--to
a newer lifeway signaled by the adoption of technological changes brought about with ceramics and
the bow and arrow. Three sites in the region with
good stratigraphic context have dart points or mixed
dart and arrow point assemblages (see Figure 2).
Camping features have been excavated at County
Line, Blue Clay, and Deadman’s Shelter (Hughes
and Willey 1978). At Deadman’s Shelter (Willey
and Hughes 1978), dart and arrow points have been
found in association with brownware pottery. Radiocarbon ages of ca. 1740 B.P. and 1830 B.P. are
the earliest dates associated with arrowpoints and
pottery in the region. Several bison kills (Twilla,

529

Bell, Strong, Collier, Sitter, Finch, R.O., and Hoover
sites) found just east of the Southern High Plains
(see Figure 2) contain a variety of Late Archaic
point designs with radiocarbon ages that averaged
1387 B.P. (D. Hughes 1977).
This 1,000 year span within the Ceramic period also is characterized by comer-notched Scallom
arrow points and coarse-tempered cordmarked pottery (Hughes and Willey 1978). Only a few
Scallorn-associated sites are known and they are
not well-dated. Chalk Hollow (Wedel 1975) has an
upper component with Scallorn points and pottery
(Lintz 1995), while Lake Creek (J. Hughes 1962)
and Borger Bridge (Hughes and Willey 1978) are
also considered to date from Scallorn times. At
Lubbock Lake, this period of occupation is indicated by a hearth with associated camping debris
that included a Scallorn point, modern bison remains, lithic tools and flakes, and bone beads
(Kelley 1974). Downstream at 41GR291
(Justiceburg Reservoir or Lake Alan Henry),
Deadman’s and Scallorn points were found associated in a camp occupation (Boyd et al. 1990; see
also Boyd, this volume).
The later Ceramic period (ca. 1000 to 500 B.P.)
is characterized by a mixed assemblage of Puebloan
trade pottery and Plains lithic tool types. The
tradewares are dominated by Mogollon ceramics,
representing the eastern variety of the Jornada
branch of the Mogollon culture (see Perttula et al.,
this volume). Numerous sites are known from this
time period but few occur in good stratigraphic
context. Examples are such sites as Jim Arnold
(Tunnell 1964), A769 (Harrison and Griffin 1973),
Floydada Country Club (Word 1963, 1991),
Montgomery (Word 1965), 41CB27 (Parker 1982),
Pete Creek, Grape Creek, and Dockum Springs
(Parsons 1967), 41TY2 (Pope 1991), the lower level
at Slaton Dump (Booker and Campbell 1978),
Petree (Riggs 1972), Gresham Lake (Breeding
1971), and Bull Hill (Shawn t975).
At Lubbock Lake, game-animal (modem bison, pronghorn antelope, coyote, and wolf) processing stations are found in serial stratigraphic
position. Although these stations lack ceramics, radiocarbon assays and stratigraphic position indicate
this latter part of the Ceramic as the period of occupation (Johnson 1987b). At Justiceburg Reservoir
(Lake Alan Henry), two late Ceramic campsites
(41GR303 and 41GR393), four Ceramic-age campsites (41GR359, 41GR383, 41GR456, 41KT52),

Protohistoric Period

Historic Period

Numerous Protohistoric sites are known in the
region but again few occupations are in good stratigraphic context. At Lubbock Lake, numerous occupation levels attest to intense and repeated use of
the area. These levels are characterized by Garza
points, occur in serial stratigraphic sequence, and
have associated radiocarbon ages of ca. 500 to 300
B.P. (Johnson et al. 1977; Holliday et al. 1983,
1985). Both living surfaces with associated hearths
and large game-animal processing stations occur in
these occupation levels.
Less than ! km downstream from Lubbock
Lake, Protohistoric Garza occupations within a geologically-stratified context have been excavated at
41LU26 and 4tLU35 (Bandy et al. 1981). Wheat
(1955) tested a Garza campsite on the uplands overlooking Yellowhouse Canyon in the vicinity of Buffalo Springs Lake. Further downstream at the
Justiceburg Reservoir (Lake Alan Henry) area, Boyd
et al. (1989, 1990) recorded and tested several Garza
occupations, and excavated two sites (Longhorn
and Headstream) spanning the Protohistoric and
Historic periods that may be Garza occupation sites
(Boyd et al. 1990, 1993; Boyd and Peck 1992). The
Garza (Runkles 1964) and Lott (Runkles and
Dorchester 1987) sites, in geologically-unstratified
context, are located just off the Southern High Plains
along tributaries of the Double Mountain Fork of
the Brazos River.
Northeast of Lubbock Lake, in the Running
Water Draw system, a Garza occupation within a
stratified context was tested at the Floydada Country Club site (Word 1963, 1991) in Blanco Canyon
near Floydada. Downstream about 5 km, Garza occupations mixed in unstratified contexts with earlier and later components also were tested at the
Montgomery site (Word 1965) and 41CB27 (Parker
1982; Baugh 1992). Northward in lower Tule Canyon, Katz and Katz (1976) excavated a hearth at
41BI83 that dates to this time period, but it lacked
diagnostic artifacts. Further north, J. Hughes (1971)
tested a Garza occupation within a stratified context at the Canyon City Club Cave site along Palo
Duro Creek at the outskirts of Canyon. West of
Lubbock Lake just off the Southern High Plains,
Speth and Parry (1978, 1980) excavated Garza sites

Historic period sites in good stratigraphic context are extremely rare on the Southern High Plains.
This period is marked by the appearance of European trade goods and modern horse remains. It is
subdivided into aboriginal Historic and Anglo-Historic times. At Lubbock Lake, numerous aboriginal
Historic occupation levels are characterized by
Washita points. These levels occur in serial stratigraphic sequence, and have associated radiocarbon
ages of ca. 300 to 150 B.P. (Holliday et al. 1983,
1985). Processing stations are similar to ones in the
Protohistoric and Ceramic periods. They are distinctive, however, in the inclusion of modern horse
as a game-animal.
Further downstream, aboriginal Historic sites
have been tested at 41LU35 (Bandy et al. 1981),
41GR484, 41KT53, and 41KT69 (Boyd et al. 1990).
Several historic rock art sites are present in the
Justiceburg Reservoir (Lake Alan Henry) area
(Boyd 1992; Boyd and Kibler 1993). Historic period
glass trade beads from the 1700s have been
recovered from 41CB27 (Parker 1982) in Blanco
Canyon near Crosbyton, and the Headstream site
(Boyd and Peck 1992; Peck et al. 1993) at
Justiceburg Reservoir (Lake Alan Henry). To the
north, two probable Comanche sites have been
excavated at MacKenzie Reservoir (Hughes and
Willey 1978) in Tute Canyon with distinctive
hearths and post- 1840 glass seed beads. At Lubbock
Lake, a Comanche occupation is represented by
several activity areas that have yielded glass seed
beads (Ladkin 1993, 1995). The Codgell (Word
and Fox 1975) and White (Suhm 1961) sites in
Floyd and Yoakum counties also contained glass
seed beads.
European occupation of the Southern High
Plains began in the middle to late 1800s. The first
Europeans were buffalo hunters and U.S. military
units, followed by sheepherders (Pastores), traders,
ranchers, and settlers. Few excavations of these
sites have been conducted. A buffalo hunter’ s camp,
occupied sometime between 1874 and 1879, was
tested at Justiceburg Reservoir (Lake Alan Henry)
(41GR528 [see Freeman and Boyd 1990]). The
Pastores, Hispanic sheepherders from New Mexico,
began moving into the Canadian River Valley in

Johnson and Holliday ~ Archeology and Late Quaternary Environments
the early 1870s, and by the late 1870s, small
settlements, such as at Tascosa, were being
established in the valley (Archambeau 1946; Taylor
1980), with the southernmost settlement at MerrellTaylor Village (Guffee 1976) on Quitaque Creek
along the escarpment below Palo Duro Canyon.
Test excavation and recording of rock corrals at the
Ellis site (Lichti 1994; Hicks and Johnson in
preparation) in Yellowhouse Canyon near
Southland, and the Massie site (Word 1980; Lichti
1994) in Blanco Canyon near Floydada, document
the transhumance use of the Southern High Plains
by the Pastores. By the mid-1880s, the Pastores had
left the region and returned to New Mexico (Rathjen
1973; Taylor 1980).
At the northern end of the Southern High
Plains, excavations at Adobe Walls (Baker and
Harrison 1986) along the Canadian River revealed
a wide variety of European goods available to the
area’s occupants during the late 1860s to 1870s.
Along Yellowhouse Draw in the east-central Southern High Plains, Singer Store was a trading post
located at Lubbock Lake from 1881 to 1886 (Holden
1974). Testing produced artifacts (square nails,
metal cans, and a ginger beer bottle) relating to this
occupation, as well as artifacts attesting to buffalo
hunting activity (heavy-caliber rifle shell casings)
(Johnson 1987b). Archaeological exploration occurred at one of the XIT Ranch headquarters (Jackson 1976) near Hereford.
Just off the Southern High Plains in the
Justiceburg Reservoir (Lake Alan Henry) area, testing of historic sites (Freeman and Boyd 1990) included that of a sheepherder’s camp dating from
the 1880s (41GR443), several dugouts occupied
between the 1880s and 1900 (41GR474, 41GR263,
41GR392, and 41KT150), an 1880s to 1920s line
camp (41KT84), several homesteads (41GR250,
41GR474, and 41GR443), ranch headquarters
(41GR13), and a town building (41GR331).
Investigations at an Anglo-Historic dump in
Lamb County documented two dumping periods at
the site, one episode around 1915 and the other
centered around 1935 (Hicks et al. 1994). These
episodes corresponded with two periods of population increase for the city of Littlefield. At Lubbock
Lake, Anglo-Historic dumps from the early 20th
century were tested. Dumping episodes centered
around 1940 and t955, also corresponding to periods of population increase for the city of Lubbock
(O’Brien 1995).

SUMMARY DISCUSSION
The Late Quaternary archeological and
paleoenvironmental records of the Southern High
Plains are well-preserved in the draws, dunes, and
lake basins of the region. The fill in the draws historically is most-closely linked to the human history of the region as a result of the discovery of
several renowned archeological sites in these settings. The draws also provide the most complete
and sensitive regional environmental record so far
available.
At the beginning of the Paleoindian occupation, the environment of the Southern High Plains,
for the most part, was relatively cool and moist.
The draws had perennial flowing water, and lake
basins probably had permanent water. Haynes
(1991) proposed a Clovis-age drought for the region based on stratigraphic data from the Clovis
and Miami sites and argued that megafaunal extinctions at the end of the Pleistocene were linked
to that drought. This hypothesis is not supported by
paleobotanical, paleontological, or other stratigraphic data from the regional draws, dunes, or
playas (Holliday 1995b, 1995c). The earliest evidence of warming and drying in the Late Quaternary is from the Folsom period (Holliday 1995c).
By Folsom times, hydrologic conditions
changed. Less flowing water was available in the
draws as spring discharge and runoff declined.
Streams were replaced with ponds and marshes.
Aeolian sedimentation appeared in the stratigraphic
record by 10,000 B.P., and aeolian deposition in
the draws, dunes, and playas became more widespread through the Early Holocene.
This deposition culminated in the Middle Holocene in significant filling of draws and construction of sand dunes. This aeolian activity likely
marked peak aridity in the Late Quaternary in response to increased temperatures and lower effective precipitation relative to the preceding or
following periods. By about 4,500 years ago, a
change in climate toward more moist and cooler
conditions, relative to the Middle Holocene, brought
landscape stability and environmental changes that
have more or less persisted to present times. This
stability resulted in little Late Holocene sedimentation in the region.
This stratigraphic and paleoenvironmental
scheme generally follows earlier reconstructions of
the paleoecology of the Southern High Plains (e.g.

532

Texas Archeological Society

Wendorf 1961; Wendorf and Hester 1975) but
differs considerably in detail. The various Late
Pleistocene and Early Holocene climatic intervals
proposed in earlier schemes are not identifiable in
the stratigraphic record now emerging due to
problems of dating, stratigraphic correlation, and
pollen preservation in the work that led to the earlier
schemes (Holliday 1987, 1995c).
The known archeological record for the Southern High Plains provides a lengthy and rich heritage for the region. People have lived on and used
the Southern High Plains for at least 11,000 years,
and perhaps for as long as people have been in the
New World. Although varying through time in variety, quality, and plentitude, the environments of
the Southern High Plains have provided ample natural resources for the various peoples inhabiting the
region. This resource base is spread over large parameters of seasonality, space, and time, and the
abundance or scarcity and sparcity of such resources
as lithic materials, water, and wood on the Southern High Plains has influenced the adaptive responses to environment and environmental change
as conditions went from pluvial, to xeric, to mesic.
The relationship between environment and the
people that occupied that environment, then, potentially could be well-defined in such settings.
High-quality lithic resources were a localized
resource at best, represented by Alibates agate at
the northern edge of the region along the Canadian
River and Tecovas jasper at the eastern edge of the
escarpment near Quitaque (e.g., Holliday and
Welty 1981; Banks 1990). Ogallala Formation
quartzites and cherts (generally of much poorer
quality) were available along the escarpment and
at localized outcrops within the draws (Holliday
and Welty 1981). Due to this limited distribution,
imported lithic resources, particularly from Central
Texas (Edwards Formation chert), played a major
role in the adaptive strategies utilized on the Southern High Plains.
Resource availability of wood and water
closely mirrored the climatic changes of the region.
Both commodities were available regionally, and
were locally abundant during the Late Pleistocene
and Early Holocene, but became much more scarce
and further localized during the Middle Holocene
(Johnson 1987c; Meltzer 1991; Holliday 1989,
1995b, 1995c). Surface waters in playas and draws
increased again in the Late Holocene (Holliday
1995b, 1995c), with limited wood resources

available only within the draws (Johnson 1987c).
An episodic pattern of droughts for about the past
2,000 years (Holliday 1985, 1995b, 1995c)
undoubtedly affected long-term adaptive strategies.
Coupled with the drought pattern for at least the
last 500 years was the steady influx of various
groups of non-local peoples, from the Athabascans
and Comanche to the Pastores and AngloAmericans, and the eventual replacement of the
indigenous people.
The long record of occupation of the Southern
High Plains primarily was of hunter-gatherer
peoples, presumably practicing a seasonal yearly
round of activities. In general, Clovis peoples had a
broad-spectrum, meat-related subsistence base
where they were hunting and scavenging a widevariety of game animals. With widespread extinctions, bison became the major game animal of
post-Clovis peoples. Later Paleoindian peoples had
a very narrow-spectrum, meat-related subsistence
base, systematically cropping both small cow-calf
herds as well as large mixed herds of bison. By the
Middle Holocene, Archaic peoples had a mixed
desert plant and meat-related subsistence base, and
they were forced to rely on wells for water in the
western and southern part of the Southern High
Plains. A mixed plant and meat-related subsistence
base continued throughout Late Holocene Ceramic
through aboriginal Historic times, but with more
mesic vegetation and abundant surface water
(Johnson 1987c, 1991, 1994; Johnson and Holliday
1986; Meltzer 1991).
The occupation of the Southern High Plains
through time by these hunter-gatherer peoples appears to be by small groups of people for both
economic (hunting, plant processing, and tool production and rejuvenation) and short-term residential uses, with repeated use of the landscape as well
as differential use of landscape features. Key aspects missing from the record are longterm home
bases and quarries for lithic resources. Quarries
must have existed along the outcroppings of
Alibates and Tecovas but they have not been documented. Quarrying of outcrops of Ogalalla Formation materials has been documented on the Rolling
Plains just off the eastern escarpment in the Brazos
River drainage (Johnson 1994).
Various Late Holocene peoples along the Canadian River and associated drainageways, in particular the Antelope Creek peoples, practiced
agriculture that modified or changed lifestyles and

social organization. This lifeway was brief on the
Southern High Plains, being practiced for much
less than 1,000 years and apparently coming to an
end in the A.D. 1400s as outsiders moved into the
region. From then on into the 1800s, aboriginal

occupation of the northern Southern High Plains
was again by hunterer-gatherers.
By the 1860s, a quick succession of non-aboriginal peoples began using the Southern High
Plains for economic purposes, and then settling the
region. This intrusion brought to a close the aboriginal occupation of the region by the late 1870s.

The use of land and other resources changed dramatically from the aboriginal patterns to patterns of
the non-aboriginal peoples. The buffalo hunters
decimated the bison herds while the Pastores and
ranchers used the plains grasslands to pasture domestic stock (sheep, then cattle). The early settlers
plowed the grasslands to raise domesticated crops.
By the turn of the century, towns were being established on the uplands, away from the traditional
aboriginal resource bases of the draws and playas.
