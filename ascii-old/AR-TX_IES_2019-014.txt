ABSTRACT
This report documents the substantive findings and management recommendations of a
cultural resources survey conducted by Integrated Environmental Solutions, LLC (IES) for
the proposed North McKinney Parallel Interceptor project located in Collin County, Texas.
The Area of Potential Effects (APE) will cross federal land regulated by the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers (USACE). Therefore, the project will be subject to the provisions of
the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA), as amended. The NHPA (54 U.S.
Code [U.S.C.] 300101 et seq.), specifically Section 106 of the NHPA (54 U.S.C. 306108)
requires the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), an official appointed in each State
or territory, to administer and coordinate historic preservation activities, and to review and
comment on all actions licensed by the federal government that will have an effect on
properties listed in the National Register of Historic Place (NRHP), or eligible for such
listing. Per 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 800, the federal agency responsible
for overseeing the action must make a reasonable and good faith effort to identify cultural
resources. Additionally, the North Texas Municipal Water District is a political subdivision
of the State of Texas, the project is subject to the provisions of the Antiquities Code of
Texas (ACT).
The goal of this survey was to locate cultural resources that could be adversely affected by
the proposed development, and to provide an evaluation of the eligibility potential of each
identified resource for listing in the NRHP or for designation as a State Antiquities
Landmark (SAL). This cultural resources survey was conducted by Principal Investigator
Christopher Goodmaster, Staff Archeologist Joshua McCormick, and Equipment Operator
Toby Settle on 15 through 17 January, 21 January, and 24 January 2019. All work
conformed to 13 Texas Administrative Code 26, which outlines the regulations for
implementing the ACT, and was conducted under Antiquities Permit No. 8701.
As a result of this survey, archeological site 41COL317 was documented. Site 41COL317
pertains to the former alignment of a historic-period road that once bisected the APE during
the early-to-mid 20th century. As this resource is not associated with historicallysignificant individuals or events, does not contain innovative or artistic design elements,
and does not preserve information important archeological information, site 41COL317 is
recommended not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or designation as a SAL.
No artifacts were collected as part of this survey. All project-related records and field data
will be temporarily stored at the IES McKinney office and permanently curated at the
Center for Archeological Research at The University of Texas at San Antonio. No further
cultural resources investigation or evaluation of the APE is recommended. However, if
any cultural resources are encountered during construction, the operators should stop
construction activities in the vicinity of the inadvertent discovery, and immediately contact
the project cultural resources consultant to initiate coordination with the USACE and Texas
Historical Commission prior to resuming construction activities.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
This report presents the results of a cultural resources survey conducted by Integrated Environmental
Solutions, LLC (IES), under contract to Teague Nall and Perkins, Inc. on behalf of the North Texas
Municipal Water District (NTMWD). The purpose of these investigations was to conduct an inventory of
cultural resources (as defined by Code of Federal Regulations, Title 36, Section 800.4 [36 CFR 800.4])
present within the proposed project area or Area of Potential Effects (APE) and to evaluate identified
resources for their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), as per
Section 106 (36 CFR 800) of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA), as amended, or for
designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SAL) under the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT; Texas
Natural Resources Code, Title 9, Chapter 191 [9 TNRC 191]) and associated state regulations (Texas
Administrative Code, Title 13, Chapter 26 [13 TAC 26]). The goal of this survey was to locate, identify,
and assess archeological sites, buildings, structures, or other cultural resources within the proposed survey
area that may be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or designation as SALs. This investigation was
conducted in accordance with 36 CFR 60.4 and 13 TAC 26, which outline the regulations for implementing
Section 106 of the NHPA and the ACT, respectively. Prepared in accordance with the Council of Texas
Archeologists (CTA 2002) guidelines, this report satisfies the NHPA Section 106 and the ACT
requirements of the proposed project. A description of the proposed project area, pertinent regulations,
environmental and historical contexts, field and analytical methods, results of the investigations, and
recommendations regarding the identified cultural resources are provided in this document.

1.1 Regulatory Framework
The NTMWD is a political subdivision of the State of Texas and the project will therefore be subjected to
the provisions of the ACT. In addition, the project crosses property managed by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE). The project will consequently require compliance with the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA) and Section 106 of the NHPA. All investigations were conducted in accordance with
36 CFR 800.4 and 13 TAC 26, which outline the regulations for implementing Section 106 of the NHPA
and the ACT, respectively.
1.1.1 Antiquities Code of Texas
As the NTMWD is a political subdivision of the State of Texas, it is required to comply with the ACT. The
ACT was passed in 1969 and requires that Texas Historical Commission (THC) staff review actions that
have the potential to disturb historic and archeological sites on public land. Actions that require review
under the ACT include any project that includes ground-disturbing activities greater than 5 acres (ac) or
involving 5,000 cubic feet (ft) of ground disturbance on land owned or controlled by a political subdivision
of the State and include easements on private property. However, if the activity occurs inside a designated
historic district, affects a recorded archeological site, or requires on-site investigations, the project review
by the THC is required regardless of project size. Each cultural resource encountered was assessed for
designation as a SAL under the ACT, as per 13 TAC 26. This survey was conducted under Antiquities
Permit No. 8701.
1.1.2 National Historic Preservation Act
The proposed project will cross federally-owned property managed by the USACE. Therefore, the project
will be subject to the provisions of the NHPA (54 U.S. Code [U.S.C.] 300101 et seq.). The NHPA,
specifically Section 106 of the NHPA (54 U.S.C. 306108), requires the State Historic Preservation Officer
(SHPO), an official appointed in each State or territory, to administer and coordinate historic preservation
activities, and to review and comment on all actions licensed by the federal government that will have an
effect on properties listed in the NRHP, or eligible for such listing. Federal actions include, but are not
limited to, construction, rehabilitation, repair projects, demolition, licenses, permits, loans, loan guarantees,

grants, and federal property transfers. As the project will occur on federally-owned property managed by
the USACE, it is subject to the provisions of the NHPA, as amended.

1.2 Project Description
The proposed project consists of the construction of a sewer interceptor pipeline extending approximately
2.27 miles (mi) in length from approximately 0.08-mi north of Farm-to-Market Road (FM) 546 to the
Wilson Creek Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant (Figures 1.1 and 1.2).

1.3 Area of Potential Effects
1.3.1 Direct APE
The 2.27-mi-long APE will be 155 ft wide and encompass approximately 34.4 ac. Within the 155-ft-wide
APE, 35 ft will be located within existing NTMWD utility easements, which contain two existing sewer
interceptor pipelines. The remaining 120 ft of the APE will straddle the existing utility easement and will
accommodate the proposed utility and construction easements (Appendix A).
The proposed sewer interceptor will be collocated 20 ft from an existing NTMWD interceptor pipeline.
Although the proposed construction methods are still being evaluated, it is possible the entire pipeline will
be installed through the use of a 12-ft-wide open-cut trench. However, project engineers are evaluating
whether a section of the pipeline surrounding Wilson Creek can be tunneled.
The vertical impacts associated with this project will typically extend between the ground surface during
vegetation removal and up to 31 ft below surface within areas of open-cut trenching for installation of the
sewer pipeline. If tunneling methods are utilized surrounding Wilson Creek, ground disturbances will
transpire below the depth that potential archeological deposits could be present. Given the uncertainty of
construction methods at the time of this survey, field investigations were conducted under the assumption
that the entire pipeline will be installed using open-cut trenching methods. Subsequently, field
investigations assessed to the depth of soils capable of containing cultural resources.
1.3.2 Indirect APE
As the project will occur on federal property regulated by the USACE, an assessment of indirect effects
will be required within USACE jurisdiction to satisfy Section 106 of the NHPA requirements. Although
limited project elements will remain above ground, these elements will have minimal vertical footprints
(i.e., access points, signage, etc.) and will be located within and adjacent to an existing utility corridor.
Thus, these project-related elements were determined to have negligible potential to adversely affect nonarcheological resources. As such, indirect effects will not be formally assessed for this project.

CHAPTER 2: ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
2.1 Environmental Setting
2.1.1 Climate
Collin County lies in the north-central part of the State of Texas. Annual precipitation averages between
approximately 35 to 42 inches (in). About half of the precipitation usually occurs as rain between April
and May, with July and August being the two driest months of the year. The subtropical region tends to
have a relatively mild year-round temperature with the occasional exceedingly hot and cold periods
(Estaville and Earl 2008).
2.1.2 Topography, Geology, and Soils
The McKinney East 7.5-minute U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) topographic quadrangle map illustrates
that the APE is primarily located along the transition of a prominent upland ridge, west of the broad valley
of the East Fork Trinity River (see Figure 1.1). The southern portion of the proposed alignment, comprising
approximately 0.6 mi of the APE, extends across the Wilson Creek floodplain, near its confluence with the
East Fork Trinity River. Since 1953, the East Fork Trinity River and several of its tributaries have been
impounded approximately 10 mi downstream of the APE to form Lavon Lake. Due to the varied
topographic setting within the APE, a variety of topographic features will be crossed by the proposed
project, including footslope, toeslope, distal floodplain, and proximal floodplain landforms (sensu Ruhe
1960; Wysocki et al. 2000) at an elevation range of 495 to 513 ft above modern sea level (amsl).
The APE lies within the Northern Blackland Prairie subregion of the Texas Blackland Prairies ecoregion.
This area is distinguished from surrounding regions by gently rolling hills and fine-textured, black clay-rich
soils and prairie vegetation (Griffith et al. 2004). Vertisols dominate the Blackland Prairie ecoregion and
consist of high clay content soils that have significant shrink and swell potential. Most of the native prairie
has been converted to cropland, non-native pasture, and expanding urban uses. Historical vegetation
included little bluestem, big bluestem, yellow Indiangrass, and tall dropseed.
The APE is underlain by Quaternary-age fluviatile terrace (Qt) and alluvium (Qal) deposits (Figure 2.1).
These deposits are comprised of sand, silt, clay, and gravel (McGowen et al. 1991; USGS 2019). The
Quaternary-age alluvium and terrace deposits are comprised of clay and silty clay largely derived from the
East Fork Trinity River and its major tributaries.
As indicated by the Soil Survey of Collin County, Texas, there are eight soil map units within the APE
(Hanson and Wheeler 1969; Table 3; Figure 2.27). Approximately 47 percent of the soils within the APE
pertain to frequently or occasionally flooded soils within floodplain landforms. The remaining 53 percent
of the APE contains soils typical of upland settings within the Northern Blackland Prairies ecoregion. Soil
data was viewed from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service
(NRCS) Web Soil Survey (Web Soil Survey 2019).

CHAPTER 3: CULTURAL BACKGROUND
3.1 Previous Investigations
A file search within the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) and the Texas Historic Sites Atlas (THSA)
databases, maintained by the THC, indicated there are no previously recorded archeological sites, National
Register properties or districts, historical markers, or cemeteries within the APE (TASA 2019; THSA
2019). The TASA database identified two previously conducted archeological surveys within the APE
(TASA 2019; Table 3.1; Figure 3.1). In addition, TASA records indicate that six previously conducted
archeological surveys and four previously recorded archeological sites are located within 1 mi of the APE
(TASA 2019; Tables 3.2 and 3.3).

In 1990, a cultural resources survey was conducted by Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI) along the easement of the
original 8.3-mi-long NTMWD North McKinney Interceptor sewer pipeline (Peter et al. 1990). The
southern half of the 1990 GMI survey area overlaps the western margin of the currently proposed APE.
With only seven shovel tests and 11 backhoe trenches excavated with the APE, the previous survey does
not meet currently-accepted archeological survey standards (CTA 2001); however, four of the backhoe
trenches excavated during the 1990 GMI survey are within or immediately adjacent to the current project
APE (Peter et al. 1990:Figure 4).
In 1998, GMI conducted a cultural resources survey for the NTMWD Princeton Lift Station and 3.6 mi of
pipeline within a 100-ft-wide temporary construction easement that crosses the northern portion of the
current APE along FM 546 (Hunt et al. 1998). During that survey, a series of shovel tests were excavated

within areas deemed to have a high probability for containing archeological deposits and five backhoe
trenches were excavated within where pipeline crossed the floodplain and terraces of the East Fork Trinity
River, including a backhoe trench within or immediately adjacent to the current project APE (Hunt et al.
1998:Figure 2).

3.2 Regional Historical Background
Although the establishment of the first Spanish missions in the early 1700s denotes the beginning of the
historic period in the State of Texas, European settlement within the region was sparse. Early Spanish
exploration was limited to areas along the Rio Grande River and the coast. The limited settlement within
North-Central Texas prior to the mid-1800s was due to the hostile relations with the Native American
Comanche, Kiowa, and Wichita tribes (Hightower 2016).
After the Republic of Texas was established in 1836, 180 million ac were opened for settlement. To entice
settlers from the United States, large land grants, bounties, headrights, and premiums were issued out to
those who qualified. One such land grant was issued to William S. Peters, an English businessman who
immigrated to the United States in 1827. Peters was an empresario (or immigration agent) who received
several land grant contracts from the Republic. The first of these contracts resulted in the formation of
Peters Colony.
The terms of the contract required the empresario to recruit settlers from outside the Republic at a rate of
200 families within a 3-year period. In return, the colonists were to be granted 320 ac per single man and
a maximum of 640 ac per family. The empresario was allowed to retain up to one-half of a colonist’s grant
as payment for services rendered, including land surveys and title applications. The empresario provided
powder, shot, and seed. In some cases, the empresario constructed settler cabins. The empresario also
received 10 sections of premium land from the Republic for every 100 families they settled (Stambaugh
and Stambaugh 1958).
Although the endeavor of Peters Colony was riddled with confusion of ownership and other difficulties,
Collin County witnessed continued growth and economic stability throughout the Republic of Texas years
and after the annexation of Texas to the United States in December 1845. After the election of President
Lincoln in 1860, Texas secessionists called for a vote that resulted in a decree of succession. Most Collin
County residents opposed the call for Texas to secede from the Union by a vote of 948 to 405. However,
the people of Texas, as a whole, loyally supported the Confederacy. The popular vote was 46,129 to 14,697
in favor of secession and, on 05 March 1861, Texas joined the Confederacy (Stambaugh and Stambaugh
1958).
While Collin County was spared the horrors of invading Union troops, the civilian population still suffered.
Practically every able-bodied man between the ages of 17 to 50 was in the Confederate Army. Food was
scarce and Union sympathizers, deserters, and criminals were a constant threat to the families left behind.
Following the Civil War, hostilities continued during the Reconstruction Period as exemplified by the LeePeacock feud. Robert Lee, who was an ex-confederate officer, and Lewis Peacock, who was a Union
sympathizer, were involved in one of the most prolific post-Civil War feuds in North-Central Texas.
Although it is unclear exactly how the feud began, hostilities arose when Lee was kidnapped and extorted
by Peacock and his supporters. Their feud terrorized what was known as the “Five Corners” region (corners
of Collin, Grayson, Fannin, and Hunt counties) for four years (1867 to 1871) and ended with the death of
both men (Hall and Hall 2009; Lee and Stambaugh 1958; Stambaugh and Stambaugh 1958).
It was not until the late 19th and early 20th century that the fertile nature of Collin County and North-Central
Texas was capitalized upon and became an important regional center for producing and processing cotton,
wheat, and corn. Ancillary industries developed in association with these cash crops, including grain
elevators, flour mills, cotton gins, compresses, cotton oil mills, and a textile mill. Cotton developed as the
key agricultural product for the region. Collin County increased its stronghold in 1872 with the arrival of
the Houston and Texas Central Railroad. Cotton producers no longer endured the slow overland

transportation of their cotton to markets in east Texas, making cotton extremely profitable. Crop production
continues in Collin County today, but its significance in the local economy diminished after World War II
(WWII) when cattle production and dairy farming became more common (Hall and Hall 2009, Stambaugh
and Stambaugh 1958). Collin County saw dramatic changes in the 1880s. The introduction of the lighting
industry and the sudden growth of the Dallas metropolitan area led to a more diverse economy focused on
industry, technology, and services, and less on agriculture. This trend has continued to present day.

3.3 Cultural Resources Potential
In addition to the TASA and THSA review, several additional resources were referenced to determine the
overall potential for encountering cultural resources within the APE. These resources included soil survey
data (NRCS 2019; Ford and Pauls 1980), geologic data (McGowen et al. 1987), the Texas Department of
Transportation (TxDOT) Potential Archeological Liability Map (PALM), the National Archives and
Records Administration’s (NARA) 1940 Census Enumeration District Maps for Collin County, the Texas
Historic Overlay (THO) georeferenced maps, and historic and modern aerial photography and satellite
imagery.
3.3.1 Disturbance Analysis
During the background review, it was determined that the APE was primarily used for agricultural and
ranching purposes as early as 1895, and presumably since the mid-to-late 19th century. The majority of the
APE had also been cleared of woody vegetation at various points through the 20th century, which has been
replaced by secondary growth. The most significant ground disturbance within the APE occurred when the
existing NTMWD McKinney North sewer interceptor pipeline was installed between 1990 and 1995. In
2015, a sanitary sewer force main line was constructed parallel to the existing interceptor line.
Subsequently, an estimated 35-ft-wide corridor has been previously disturbed through the entire APE
during open-cut trenching for the installation of two existing NTMWD sewer pipelines. Although the
maintained utility corridor for the existing pipelines varies from approximately 30 to 80 ft wide, subsurface
disturbances are anticipated to be shallow and primarily related to tree removal, construction staging, and
vehicular traffic.
Historically, the upland setting found in the central portion of the APE supported more residences and farms
than the northern or southern portions. According to historical maps, Evans Road and several unnamed
rural roads within and adjacent to the APE were present by 1930. These roads were lined with farmsteads
from the early to mid-20th century. In the second half the 20th century, many of the farmsteads within or
adjacent to the APE were abandoned. Since the construction of Lavon Lake dam in 1953, many of the
farmsteads within or adjacent to the APE were demolished and the properties left to become overgrown
with secondary vegetation.
3.3.2 Prehistoric Archeological Resources Potential
The TxDOT PALM for Collin County indicates that approximately 98 percent of the APE features a high
potential for containing shallow and deeply buried archeological deposits within areas that retain a
reasonable degree of contextual integrity. The remaining approximately 2 percent of the APE, located
within the upland toeslope west of the APE, features a moderate potential for containing shallow and deeply
buried cultural deposits within areas that retain a reasonable degree of contextual integrity. Although the
PALM indicates 98 percent of the APE has a high potential for containing deeply buried prehistoric sites,
only approximately 47 percent of the APE is located within frequently or occasionally flooded alluvial
soils. Thus, it is anticipated that the potential for deeply buried archeological deposits is likely to occur
within 47 percent of the APE, rather than the 98 percent suggested by the TxDOT PALM.
As previously discussed, significant ground-disturbing activities have transpired within discrete sections of
the APE near the former locations of historic-age residences or within the footprint of existing sewer

interceptor pipeline alignments. Areas outside of these locations were assessed to have retained a high to
moderate potential for encountering prehistoric cultural materials.
3.3.3 Historic Period Resources Potential
Historic-period resources within North-Central Texas are primarily related to farmsteads, houses, and
associated outbuildings and other structures that date from the mid-19th to the mid-20th centuries. Typically,
these types of resources are located along old roadways, but can be located along railroads, streams, and
open pastures. Although determining the presence of the earliest of these buildings and structures is
problematic, maps depicting these features were widely available post-1930.
According to historic maps and aerial photographs, four buildings were once located within or immediately
adjacent to the APE. The 1930 USDA Collin County soils map depicts all four of these structures within
or adjacent to the APE. The USDA soils map also depicts that the alignments of five historic-age roads are
crossed by the APE.
The southernmost structure was located south of the Collin County Road (CR) 325 and north of Wilson
Creek. Historical photographs and topographic maps depict a farmstead at this location consisting of three
buildings. Between 1968 and 1982, the buildings and the segment of CR 318 leading to the farmstead were
removed. During the 1990 GMI cultural resources survey, investigations near this area noted historicperiod materials observed in the uppermost soil zone of Backhoe Trench 2, but the location was not
designated as an archeological site (Peter et al. 1990:20). The former location of the farmstead has
subsequently been disturbed as a result of continued slope erosion from an unnamed tributary to Lake
Lavon. The 1930 USDA soils map depicts a second building located north of the farmstead and east of the
intersection of CR 318 and CR 325. This building is illustrated on the 1936 Collin County General Highway
Map and the 1940 Census Enumeration District Map but was not present in historical aerial photographs.
Historical maps dating to the 1930s and 1940s depict a third building, east of CR 318, near the central
portion of the APE. An aerial photograph taken in 1953 indicates the location was a small farmstead
containing at least four buildings. The fourth building depicted on the 1930 USDA soils map was located
south of the farmstead along a private road. A review of aerial photographs illustrates that none of these
former buildings and structures are presently standing. Based on this information, there is a high potential
for encountering historic-period archeological resources within discrete portions of the APE.

CHAPTER 4: METHODS
Prior to fieldwork, the IES staff conducted historical and archeological records reviews to determine the
locations of previously recorded resources within the APE and within a 1-mi radius of the direct APE (see
Section 3.1). IES staff also reviewed ecological, geologic, and soils data, as well as historical and modern
topographic maps and aerial photography of the APE. The intensive archeological survey for the North
McKinney Parallel Interceptor Project was conducted on 15 through 17 January, 21 January, and 24 January
2019. The methods utilized during this survey meet the minimum archeological survey standards for field
investigations recommended by the CTA (CTA 1996, 2001), as approved by the THC.
As previously described, the APE is 155 ft wide and extends 2.27 mi from just north of FM 546 to the
Wilson Creek Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant. Existing NTMWD pipelines occupy an approximate
35-ft-wide existing utility corridor along the entire length of the APE. Surrounding the existing pipelines,
an easement ranging in width from 30 to 80 ft has been cleared of woody vegetation and is actively
maintained. Subsequently, it is assumed that an approximate 100-ft-wide corridor within the proposed 155ft-wide APE has been exposed to shallow subsurface disturbances and could contain buried archeological
deposits (Peter et al. 1990). As the previous 1990 GMI cultural resources survey for the NTMWD North
McKinney sewer interceptor pipeline utilized methods that not meet the THC’s current survey standards,
additional survey was deemed necessary for approval of the proposed project.
Standards for archeological methods typically require that measurements be recorded in metric units. For
this reason, while general distances and engineering specifications are described in imperial units (e.g., in,
ft, mi) within this report, archeological measurements and observations are listed in metric units (e.g.,
centimeters [cm], meters [m], kilometers [km]), unless historic-period artifact or architectural elements are
more appropriately recorded in imperial units.
4.1.1 Pedestrian Reconnaissance Survey
The pedestrian reconnaissance survey consisted of visual examination of the ground surface and existing
subsurface exposures for evidence of archeological sites and historic-age architectural resources within the
APE. The pedestrian survey also confirmed the locations of previous disturbances initially identified during
the background review. Areas displaying high levels of disturbance were photographed to document the
lack of potential for intact archeological deposits. Other documentation methods include narrative notes,
maps, and intensive survey sampling forms, which include shovel test, auger test, and backhoe trench forms.
4.1.2 Intensive Survey
The intensive survey consisted of a multiple transect scheme, which was implemented within portions of
the APE that did not contain existing buried utilities. The 155-ft-wide APE corridor requiring survey
straddles the existing utility easement. Thus, two survey transects (one on each side of the proposed
centerline) were required. Transects were spaced at 30 m intervals within the APE and were oriented in a
general north-to-south direction following the proposed pipeline alignment.
Shovel Tests
In areas with potential for the preservation of buried archeological materials, shovel tests were excavated
to the top of culturally sterile deposits, typically the calcic (Bk) or argillic (Bt) subsoil horizon in this area.
Generally, shovel tests were excavated in 100-m intervals along two transects spaced 30-m apart along the
APE. Each shovel test was at least 30 cm in diameter and was hand excavated in levels not exceeding 20
cm in thickness. Excavated soil was screened using 0.64-cm hardware cloth to facilitate the recovery of
buried cultural materials. If clay content was high and could not be efficiently screened, the excavated soil
was troweled through by hand and inspected for cultural materials. Investigators documented the results
of each shovel test on standardized forms. In addition, all shovel test locations were recorded using handheld Global Positioning System (GPS) units.

Cultural Resources Survey Report

IES Project No. 04.080.053
Page 17

Auger Tests
A significant effort was undertaken to evaluate the potential impacts of the project on deeply buried
archeological resources. To more adequately sample for deeply buried cultural deposits throughout the
2.27-mi-long alignment, a powered auger with a 12-in-diameter bit was used to investigate depths greater
than those typically reached within shovel tests. Auger tests were spaced at 100-m intervals along portions
of the APE that were located within frequently and occasionally flooded soils but were outside the Wilson
Creek floodplain. Auger tests were excavated to a mean depth of 1.8 m. Excavated soil was screened using
0.64-cm hardware cloth to facilitate the recovery of buried cultural materials. If clay content was high and
could not be efficiently screened, the excavated soil was troweled through by hand and inspected for cultural
materials. Investigators documented the results of each auger test on standardized forms. In addition, all
auger test locations were recorded using hand-held GPS units.
Backhoe Trenching
Due to the depth of the proposed impacts and high potential for deeply buried archeological sites within the
Wilson Creek floodplain, intensive archeological survey investigations included backhoe trenching.
Backhoe trenches averaged 6 m in length and were excavated to depths of up to 2.1 m. Once a trench had
been excavated to a depth of approximately 1.5 m, an Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA) competent field supervisor assessed the stability of the trench prior to recording soil data. If soil
stability was low, the trench was widened through benching and/or limited to a safe depth for detailed
recording of the soil profile. After the trench had been recorded, backhoe excavation continued. Backhoe
trench profiles were monitored for the presence of archeological materials. A representative soil sample
from each stratigraphic layer was screened through 0.64-cm hardware mesh. The remaining excavated soil
was visually inspected as it was placed on the spoil pile. Trench excavation ceased once the trench reached
the vertical extent of Holocene soils or the water table. Each excavated trench was photographed,
geospatially recorded using a GPS unit, and backfilled.
4.1.3 Archival Research
Prior to field investigations, a suite of archival sources including historic maps and aerial photographs was
reviewed to determine former land use patterns and the locations of historic-age (e.g., greater than 50 years
old) structures within and surrounding the APE.

4.2 Resource Evaluation
Field data were processed to evaluate site significance and potential eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP
and designation as a SAL. When applicable, a variety of data were used to assess site significance including
temporal period, artifact density, artifact variety, feature density, feature variety, feature preservation,
stratigraphic integrity, and the amount of previous disturbance.
4.2.1 NRHP Evaluation Criteria
The assessment of significance of a cultural resource is based on federal guidelines and regulations. The
criteria for evaluating resources for inclusion in the NRHP are codified under the authority of the NHPA of
1966, as amended (36 CFR 60.4 [a–d]), and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation has set forth
guidelines to use in determining site eligibility. Federal regulations indicate that “[t]he term ‘eligible for
inclusion in the National Register’ includes both properties formally determined as such by the Secretary
of the Interior and all other properties that meet National Register listing criteria” (36 CFR 800.2[e]). Based
on Advisory Council guidelines, any cultural resource that is included in or eligible for inclusion in the
National Register is a historic property.
Subsequent to the identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions, four criteria
for eligibility are applied. The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology,
engineering, and culture is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity
of location, design, setting, material, workmanship, feeling, and association and:

Criterion A:
Criterion B:
Criterion C:

Criterion D:

that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad
patterns of our history; or
that are association with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic
values, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components
may lack individual distinction; or
that have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or
history [36 CFR 60.4(a–d)].

The principal objective is to determine whether a cultural resource possesses the potential to contribute to
one or more of the above-defined criteria. Adequate information regarding site function, context, and
chronological placement from both archeological and, if appropriate, historical perspectives is essential for
cultural resources investigations. Because research questions vary as a result of geography, temporal
period, and project design, determination of site context and chronological placement of cultural resources
is a particularly important objective during the inventory and evaluation processes. Criterion D is generally
associated with prehistoric, but also historic-age, archeological sites. Criteria A, B, and C typically reflect
association with historic-age resources, rarely with prehistoric sites. The objective of the current project
was to locate and define both the horizontal and vertical extents of any cultural resources, document and
describe those resources, and then, when adequate data were present, evaluate each for NRHP eligibility.
4.2.2 State Antiquities Landmark Evaluation Criteria
For purposes of implementing the ACT, the THC is the statutorily created body responsible for protecting
and preserving SALs under the 9 TNRC 191. A SAL is an archeological site, archeological collection,
ruin, building, structure, cultural landscape, site, engineering feature, monument or other object, or district
that is eligible to be designated as a landmark or is already officially designated as a landmark. Some
archeological sites may not possess research value sufficient to warrant long-term preservation or
investigations beyond survey level documentation, and some historic buildings and structures retain
minimal integrity due to damage or deterioration. Therefore, the issue of whether cultural resources are
significant and warrant preservation, and/or further research (such as archeological testing and data
recovery level investigations), is addressed through official landmark designation, permit issuance, and
rules associated with enforcement of the ACT. TNRC Sections 191.091 and 191.092 indicate that
archeological sites and historic buildings and structures on lands belonging to state agencies or political
subdivisions of the state of Texas are landmarks or may be eligible to be designated as landmarks. Also
protected under the TNRC (Section 191.094) are specially designated landmarks on private property [above
information compiled from 13 TAC 26.2].
Under the ACT at the state level, archeological sites may be considered significant and be recognized or
designated as a SAL. The THC uses one or more of the following criteria when assessing the
appropriateness of official landmark designation, and/or the need for further investigations under the permit
process:
Criterion 1:

the site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory and/or history
of Texas by the addition of new and important information;

Criterion 2:

the site’s archeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and intact,
thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;

Criterion 3:

the site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or history;

Criterion 4:

the study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of preservation, thereby
contributing to new scientific knowledge;

Criterion 5:

there is a high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur, and
official landmark designation is needed to ensure maximum legal protection, or alternatively,

North McKinney Parallel Interceptor Project
Cultural Resources Survey Report

IES Project No. 04.080.053
Page 19

further investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and relic collecting when
the site cannot be protected [13 TAC 26.10].

Buildings, structures, cultural landscapes, and non-archeological sites, objects, and districts may be
designated as landmarks provided that the following conditions are met:
Condition 1: the property fits within at least one of the following criteria:
(a) the property is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad
patterns of our history, including importance to a particular cultural or ethnic group;
(b) the property is associated with the lives of persons significant in our past;
(c) the property embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, represents the work of a master, possesses high artistic value, or represents a
significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinctions
(d) the property has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in Texas culture
or history;
Condition 2: the property retains integrity at the time of the nomination, as determined by the executive
director of the commission; and
Condition 3: for buildings and structures only, the property must be listed in the National Register of
Historic Places, either individually, or as a contributing property within a historic district as
determined by the Keeper of the National Register or the executive director of the commission
[13 TAC 26.19].

4.3 Curation
This survey employed a non-collection strategy. Artifacts observed on the ground surface and recovered
within excavations were identified, quantified, photographed, and inventoried in the field and were returned
to the provenience from which they were recovered. Project-related records, field notes, photographs,
forms, and other documentation will be organized to curation facility standards. All project records will be
temporarily stored at the IES office and will be permanently curated at the CAR at UTSA.

CHAPTER 5: RESULTS
During this survey, the direct APE was subjected to pedestrian reconnaissance survey and a systematic
intensive survey. Pedestrian reconnaissance was conducted across portions of the APE to confirm the
extent of prior ground disturbances and assess the likelihood of encountering cultural resources. Ground
surface visibility was highly variable and irregular across the APE, ranging from 0 to 100 percent. Intensive
survey with systematic shovel test sampling in staggered intervals was conducted across previously
unsurveyed and undisturbed portions of the APE with the potential to contain archeological resources
within the shallow subsurface. Systematic auger test sampling was conducted to locate deeper Holocene
soil deposits and evaluate the potential impacts of the project to deeply buried archeological resources.
Backhoe trenching was conducted within the Wilson Creek floodplain due to the potential for deeply buried
archeological deposits in the floodplain setting.

5.1 Previous Investigations within the APE
As detailed in Chapter 3, two previous cultural resources investigations have taken place within and
immediately adjacent to the current project APE (see Figure 3.1). The 1990 GMI cultural resources survey
of the original 8.3-mi-long NTMWD North McKinney Interceptor sewer pipeline (Peter et al. 1990)
overlaps the western margin of the currently proposed APE. Although that previous survey does not meet
currently-accepted archeological survey standards (CTA 2001), four of the backhoe trenches excavated
during that investigation are within or immediately adjacent to the current project APE (Figure 5.1). The
1998 GMI cultural resources survey for the NTMWD Princeton Lift Station and associated pipeline (Hunt
et al. 1998) intersects the portion of the current APE north of FM 546. One backhoe trench excavated
during that survey is within or immediately adjacent to the current project APE (see Figure 5.1).

5.2 Archeological Survey Results
5.2.1 Pedestrian Reconnaissance Survey
Pedestrian reconnaissance survey verified the previous ground disturbances outlined in Chapter 3. The
western margin of the APE featured previously installed and currently maintained NTMWD sanitary sewer
pipelines within a maintained easement ranging from 30 to 80 ft in width (Appendix B, Photographs 1
through 8). The portion of the APE immediately north and south of FM 546 has been heavily disturbed
due to ongoing maintenance of the existing pipelines. A thick layer of gravel has been deposited and heavy
construction machinery have disturbed the ground surface. South of FM 546, the ground has been scraped,
leaving push piles within the APE. A gravel access road extends for approximately 250 m south of the FM
546 roadway. Approximately 1 km south of FM 546, remnants of the former alignment of an unnamed
road, extending east from FM 318, crosses the APE. Outside the easement, the landscape was moderately
wooded with grasses and woody shrub growth (Appendix B, Photographs 9 through 14). Within the
Wilson Creek floodplain, the APE crosses both an abandoned channel of Wilson Creek and the current,
active channel of the stream. Construction of the existing NTMWD North McKinney Interceptor has
resulted in erosion between the abandoned and active Wilson Creek channels and has effectively connected
the two channels (Appendix B, Photographs 15 and 16). Approximately 250 m north of the southern
terminus of the APE, a former borrow pit extends along the east edge of the APE and has resulted in
disturbances within the APE (Appendix B, Photographs 17 through 20).
5.2.2 Intensive Survey
Shovel Testing
Shovel tests were systematically excavated along two transects within previously unsurveyed and
undisturbed portions of the APE with the potential to contain intact buried archeological deposits within
the shallow subsurface. Shovel tests were located in upland areas, generally characterized by a variety of

grasses and eastern redcedar. During the intensive survey, 31 negative shovel tests were excavated within
the APE (see Figure 5.1). The remaining portions of the APE were determined to have either been
subjected to significant previous ground disturbances or were deemed to require auger testing or backhoe
trenching to adequately assess the potential for deeply buried cultural deposits. Previously disturbed areas
were visually assessed and photographed during the pedestrian reconnaissance survey.
Soils exposed within shovel tests generally revealed a profile that transitioned from very dark grayish brown
(10YR 3/2) to dark brown grayish (10YR 4/2) clay that contained few to no gravel inclusions (Appendix
C). Many shovel tests, especially those along the western edge of the APE, contained a layer of dark
yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay loam mottled with yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) clay. This mottled
stratum appears to be construction fill from the existing pipelines spread across the APE following previous
construction episodes. No cultural materials were encountered within shovel tests.
Auger Testing
Auger test sampling was conducted within previously unsurveyed and undisturbed portions of the APE
with the potential to contain intact deeply buried archeological deposits. Auger test locations were
generally located within landscape positions that reflected a transition between the toeslope and floodplain
landforms. These areas were typically mapped as containing occasionally or frequently flooded soils and
were characterized by early successional forests of mixed deciduous hardwood growth and isolated wetland
areas.
Auger test sampling extended to a depth of approximately 180 cm. Soils exposed within auger tests
generally revealed a profile that transitioned from a very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay loam surface
layer to dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay, then to dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay to light
yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) clay (Appendix D). Auger tests excavated near the southern terminus of the
APE (ATs 27 through 31 and AT 33) exposed soils that featured frequent (35 to 45 percent) chalky
limestone gravel inclusions, likely as a result of the shallow depth to regolith or bedrock associated with
the nearby Cretaceous-age Austin Chalk Formation along the margin of the Wilson Creek valley. Sterile
subsoil (likely Bt or Bk horizons) were typically encountered at depths ranging from 75 to 145 cm below
surface (cmbs) and it is unlikely that buried prehistoric-age soils (i.e., paleosols [Ab soil horizon]) are
present within the transitional toeslope-distal floodplain landforms within the APE. In five instances, auger
tests were terminated at depths less than the typical 180 cm due to the presence of a shallow water table.
During the survey, 34 auger tests were excavated within the APE (see Figure 5.1). Within Auger Test 15
(AT15), one machine-made, red paste brick fragment was encountered at a depth of 0 to 20 cmbs. No
additional artifacts were encountered within any of the other auger tests or the five delineation shovel tests
(STs 30 through 34; see Figure 5.1) excavated in 15-m intervals around AT15.
Backhoe Trenching
Backhoe trenching was conducted within previously unsurveyed and undisturbed portions of the Wilson
Creek floodplain due to the potential for deeply buried archeological deposits within the floodplain setting.
Four backhoe trenches were excavated in 50-m intervals south of the current Wilson Creek channel (see
Figure 5.1; Table 5.1). The approximately 100-m-wide portion of the floodplain between the abandoned
channel of Wilson Creek and the current channel was not accessible by excavation equipment and was
therefore not sampled through mechanical excavation (see Appendix B, Photographs 15 and 16).
A dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay surface layer, which extended to depths of 20 to 32 cmbs, was
encountered within all four trenches. This surface layer is likely the result of recent alluvial deposition
within the Wilson Creek floodplain. Within Trench 1, excavated approximately 7 m south of the active
Wilson Creek channel, this surface layer gradually transitioned to brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam to a depth
of 90 cmbs where a very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay loam was encountered (Appendix B,
Photographs 21 and 22). This very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay loam is likely a buried A horizon
(Ab) representing the historic-period ground surface. Historic agricultural practices and more modern
North McKinney Parallel Interceptor Project
Cultural Resources Survey Report

development and urbanization within the region have resulted in increased upland erosion and subsequent
alluvial deposition within the floodplains of the local drainages and is likely reflected in increased
sedimentation within the Wilson Creek valley since the mid-to-late 19th century.
Within Trenches 2 through 4 (Appendix B, Photographs 21 through 28), the very dark grayish brown
(10YR 3/2) clay loam Ab horizon was encountered between 20 and 32 cmbs and exhibited a mean depth
of 30 cm across the trenches. The Ab horizon gradually transitioned to a light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4)
massive clay loam B horizon. In Trench 3, at a depth of 170 cmbs, an additional probable Ab horizon was
encountered (see Appendix B, Photograph 24). This second, deeper Ab horizon may represent a stable
prehistoric ground surface, although this identification is speculative given the lack of prehistoric
archeological deposits or artifacts encountered within Trench 3.
In general, saturated soils were encountered within trenches at depths ranging from 70 to 100 cmbs across
the floodplain. The Lavon Lake conservation pool is maintained at an elevation of 492 ft amsl. Above
average seasonal precipitation rates resulted in a lake water surface elevation of 492.33 ft amsl at the time
of this survey. Excavation of all trenches within the APE was terminated at depths of 200 to 210 cmbs due
to groundwater infiltration, unstable trench profiles, and a generally unsafe environment for excavation and
documentation.

berm approximately 60 cm higher than the surrounding ground surface. The former road alignment
extended approximately 105 m west-to-east through the APE and continued an additional 30 m east of the
APE before turning south and continuing in a north-to-south orientation for approximately 12 m, where it
intercepted the APE and continued for an additional 20 m through the previously undisturbed portion of the
APE (Figure 5.2; Appendix B, Photographs 29 through 32). No indication of the site was observed within
the existing utility easement corridor, where previous construction activities have likely obscured the
surface expression of the roadway feature. A concrete pipe culvert, now partially exposed immediately
east of the APE, once passed under the corner of the roadway to improve drainage from the upland toeslope
to the East Fork Trinity River floodplain (Appendix A, Photographs 33 and 34).
Three shovel tests (ST25 through 27) and three auger tests (AT10 through 12) were excavated within and
near site 41COL317. Shovel tests excavated along the southwestern boundary of the APE, exhibited a very
dark grayish brown to dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/2 to 10YR 3/4) clay loam surface layer that extended
to a depth range of 19 to 29 cmbs overlying a dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay subsoil horizon.
Disturbed soil encountered within ST 26, reflected by dark grayish brown (10YR 6/2) clay mottles within
the surface layer, may be the result of either construction of the road or more recent activities related to the
construction of the existing North McKinney Interceptor sewer pipeline. A relatively undisturbed soil
profile was encountered within AT11, excavated within the former roadway along the northeastern APE
boundary, indicating that the roadway was likely constructed and maintained by excavating drainage
ditches along the natural ground surface rather than accumulating soil or other fill material within the
roadway. Other than the concrete pipe culvert observed within a portion of the roadway outside of the
APE, no artifacts were observed on the surface or within excavation units at the site.
The roadway approximately follows the northern and eastern boundaries of a 4.02-ac tract currently under
the ownership of the U.S. government and managed by the USACE. This tract was originally part of the
Calvin Boles Survey (Abstract A0082) patented on 17 August 1846. A review of historical maps and aerial
photographs indicate that this roadway was in existence since at least 1930, as it is depicted on the 1930
USDA Collin County soils map. Unfortunately, no earlier maps or aerial photographs are available for this
area. The former property parcel in which the road is located likely came under the control of the USACE
in the 1960s, following congressional approval to expand Lavon Lake and increase storage for water supply
due to the growing need of the region. The roadway is clearly identifiable on aerial photographs until the
1970s, when it appears to have been abandoned and CR 318 became the primary roadway in the area.
Isolates
Isolate 1 and Isolate 2 consist of two isolated artifacts encountered during this survey. Isolate 1 consists of
one machine-made, red paste brick fragment encountered at a depth of 0 to 20 cmbs within AT15. No
additional artifacts were encountered within any of the five delineation shovel tests (STs 30 through 34; see
Figure 5.1) excavated in 15-m intervals around AT15. Isolate 2 consists of a second machine-made, red
paste brick fragment observed on the ground surface near the location of ST03. No additional artifacts
were observed during the excavation of ST03 or on the ground surface in the surrounding area. As isolated
occurrences of past human activities, Isolates 1 and 2 do not meet the definition of an archeological site and
are therefore not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or designation as an SAL.

CHAPTER 6: SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
During this cultural resources survey for the North McKinney Parallel Interceptor project, the entire 34.4-ac
APE was inspected through pedestrian reconnaissance and intensive survey. In total, 35 shovel tests, 34
auger tests, and 4 backhoe trenches were excavated within the APE. As a result of the survey, one
historic-period archeological site (41COL317) was documented (Table 6.1).
Table 6.1: Summary of NRHP/SAL Eligibility Recommendations
Site Trinomial

NRHP/SAL Eligibility Recommendations

41COL317

Not Eligible

41COL317 was a newly recorded historic-period archeological site representing the remnants of a segment
of an unnamed road during the early-to-mid-20th century. The site comprised a segment of roadway
that extends across the APE and a concrete pipe culvert observed outside of the APE. Based on the
site’s lack of association with a significant historical event(s) or person(s), the absence of innovative or
artistic design elements or architectural features, and the low potential to yield significant archeological
data, site 41COL317 is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP under Criteria A, B, C, or D
nor considered for SAL designation. No further evaluation or mitigation efforts are recommended for
this site.
Therefore, it is the recommendation of IES that the North McKinney Parallel Interceptor project be
permitted to continue without the need for further cultural resources investigations. However, if any
cultural resources, other than those detailed within this report, are encountered during construction, the
operators should immediately stop construction activities in the area of the inadvertent discovery. The
project cultural resources consultant should then be contacted to initiate further consultation with the THC
and USACE prior to resuming construction activities. In addition, if project designs change, and areas
outside the APE detailed within this report are to be impacted, additional field investigations may be
required.
