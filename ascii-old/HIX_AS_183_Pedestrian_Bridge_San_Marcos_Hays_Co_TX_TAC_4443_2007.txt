Abstract

ABSTRACT
Hicks & Company archeologists conducted an archeological survey for the
proposed City of San Marcos pedestrian bridge spanning the San Marcos River
in Hays County, Texas. The project was sponsored by the City of San Marcos for
regulatory and management purposes under Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) and the Antiquities Code of Texas (13 TAC 26). All work
complied with the guidelines set out under 36 CFR 800 and the Rules of Practice
and Procedure for implementing the Antiquities Code of Texas. The linear
project area is estimated to be 10 feet wide and approximately 200 feet long, and
located north of East Hopkins Street in River Park, San Marcos, Texas. The
project area, including a 150 foot construction easement situated west of the
proposed bridge, is approximately 345 feet in length and 100 feet in width,
totaling approximately 34,500 square feet (0.79 acres).
Investigations were coordinated with the Texas Historical Commission (THC)
under Texas Antiquities Permit (TAC) No. 4443. The survey consisted of
pedestrian inspection supplemented with shovel testing and mechanical trench
excavations on the east and west banks of the San Marcos River within the
proposed project area. A total of five shovel tests and three backhoe trenches
were excavated within the project area. A single backhoe trench and three
shovel tests excavated on the west bank of the San Marcos River were negative
for cultural resources. Two backhoe trenches and one of the two shovel tests
excavated on the east side of the river were positive for cultural resources
between a depth of 30-70 centimeters below the ground surface (cmbs).
A single newly recorded archeological site (41HY432) was documented during
the current study. Site 41HY432 was recorded as a prehistoric archeological
site on the east bank of the San Marcos River within the project area. The site
boundary for 41HY432 most likely extends to the north and east beyond the
proposed project area and may be associated with previously recorded Site
41HY319, which is located approximately 100 meters to the north. This study
considered only the portion of the site within the area-of-potential effect (APE).
Current investigations indicate that the portion of Site 41HY432 within the
project APE does not have characteristics that would qualify the site for
inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) under Criterion D or
for formal designation as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL). Thus Site
41HY432 warrants no further archeological investigation. However, since
41HY432 most likely extends to the north and east outside of the current study
area, additional archeological work is recommended if construction activities
occur outside the proposed project area.
Based on the results of this survey, it is concluded that the proposed project will
have no effect on any historic properties that are considered eligible or
potentially eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or as SAL’s. All surveyed areas as
mapped under the current investigation warrant no further Section 106
consideration. No artifact collections were made for this project. All project
related records will be permanently housed at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL), in Austin, Texas.

Introduction and Executive Summary

INTRODUCTION AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Between March 5-6, 2007, Hicks & Company conducted an archeological survey
of the proposed San Marcos Pedestrian Bridge project in San Marcos, Texas, on
behalf of the City of San Marcos (Figure 1). The project was conducted at the
request of the City of San Marcos for regulatory and management purposes
under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) and the
Antiquities Code of Texas (13 TAC 26). All work complied with the guidelines set
out under 36 CFR 800 and the Rules of Practice and Procedure for implementing
the Antiquities Code of Texas. The proposed linear project area is approximately
345 feet in length and 100 feet wide, including a 150 foot construction easement
west of the proposed bridge, totaling an area of approximately 34,500 square
feet (0.79 acres). The City of San Marcos proposes to construct a Gateway truss
model bridge to span the San Marcos River, using concrete abutments located
on the upper terrace to support the structural load of the bridge.
Investigations were coordinated with the THC and occurred under Texas
Antiquities Permit (TAC) No. 4443. Investigations involved a combination of
pedestrian survey supplemented with shovel testing and backhoe trench
excavations to identify and evaluate the horizontal and vertical extent of
archeological deposits within the proposed project area. A total of five shovel
tests and three backhoe trenches were excavated within the project area. A
single backhoe trench and three shovel tests excavated on the west bank of the
San Marcos River were negative for cultural resources. Two backhoe trenches
and one of the two shovel tests excavated on the east side of the river were
positive for cultural resources between 30-70 centimeters below the ground
surface (cmbs). The entire project area was inventoried for cultural resources.
Archival research revealed that the proposed project area was first surveyed in
1977 by James Warren for the Soil Conservation Service (CSC) as part of an
aerial survey for the San Marcos Riverfront Park. Previous research and
coordination revealed eight previously recorded archeological sites (41HY133,
41HY134, 41HY135, 41HY141, 41HY161, 41HY165, 41HY261, and 41HY319)
located within a 1000 meter radius of the proposed project area. All of these
sites except Sites 41HY261 and 41HY319 are listed as State Archeological
Landmarks (SALs) in the THC Sites Atlas. None of these previously recorded
archeological sites were located within the proposed project area.
A single newly recorded archeological site (41HY432) was documented during
the current study. Site 41HY432 was recorded as a prehistoric archeological
site on the east bank of the San Marcos River within the project area. Artifacts
recovered at the site consisted of a concave basal biface fragment, three fire­
cracked-rocks (FCR), three edge modified flakes, a single bone fragment, and
four pieces of lithic debitage. The site boundary for 41HY432 most likely
extends to the north and east beyond the proposed project area and may be
associated with previously recorded Site 41HY319, which is located
approximately 100 meters to the north. This study considered only those
portions of the site within the area-of-potential effect (APE). Current
investigations indicate that this portion of Site 41HY432 does not have
characteristics that would qualify the site for inclusion in the National Register
of Historic Places (NRHP) under Criterion D or for formal designation as a State
Archeological Landmark (SAL).
Thus Site 41HY432 warrants no further
archeological investigation. However, since 41HY432 most likely extends to the
north and east outside of the current study area, additional archeological work

is recommended if construction activities occur outside the proposed project
area.
Based on the results of this survey, it is concluded that the proposed project will
have no effect on any historic properties that are considered eligible or
potentially eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or as SAL’s. All surveyed areas as
mapped under the current investigation warrant no further Section 106
consideration. No artifact collections were made for this project. All nondiagnostic artifacts were documented, photographed, and then returned to the
site area.
No logistical difficulties were encountered during the survey. Report production
occurred in March 2007. Bradford Jones functioned as Principal Investigator for
the project. Brian King served as project archeologist. Bradford Jones and
Brian King conducted the survey. Kevin Contrino is credited for the GIS
mapping. All project related records will be permanently housed at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), in Austin, Texas. This report is
offered in partial fulfillment of TAC Permit 4443.

Environmental Setting

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
GEOLOGY, SOIL AND HYDROLOGY
The San Marcos Pedestrian Bridge project area is located in the central section
of the City of San Marcos in Hays County, Texas. Generally speaking, the
project area is situated within the Balcones Escarpment which separates the
Blackland Prairie on the east from the Edwards Plateau on the west (Bureau of
Economic Geology 1996). Across this physiographic boundary are changes in
many of the natural attributes of the topography, soils, flora, and fauna.
Limestone hills, thin soils, and narrow watercourses in steep canyons
characterize the Edwards Plateau region west of the escarpment, while the
Blackland Prairie to the east is characterized by deep, fertile soils on level to
gently rolling terrain, with low gradient streams.
The area is drained by numerous streams that generally flow in an easterly
direction. The main waterways are Bear, Cypress, and Onion creeks and the
Blanco and San Marcos Rivers. The Edwards Aquifer underlies the eastern
portion of the city, where San Marcos Springs (the second largest in Texas),
delivers approximately 102 million daily gallons of water. The Aquarena Springs
is another spring that has been a significant tourist attraction in the last
century (Cecil and Greene 2001). The San Marcos River bisects the project area.
Project area surface geology consists primarily of Cretaceous-aged limestone,
dolomite, and chert overlain by Quaternary-aged alluvium and fluviatile terrace
deposits. According to the Hays County Soil Survey maps, Oakalla (OK) and
Tinn (Tn) series soils are present within the proposed project area (Battle 1984).
Oakalla soils are deep, well drained, nearly level loamy soils on flood plains. The
soils form in calcareous loamy alluvium and can reach depths of 80 centimeters.
The Oakalla series soils are bounded on both sides by Tinn (Tn) series soils.
Tinn series soils are deep, somewhat poorly drained, nearly level clayey soils on
flood plains. Soil depths reach up to 80 centimeters. Both the Oakalla and Tinn
soils have the potential to contain buried and stratified archeological materials.

VEGETATION AND WILDLIFE
The project area lies in the Edwards Plateau vegetational area, near its
boundaries with the Blackland Prairie, Post Oak Savannah, and the South Texas
Plains vegetational areas of Texas (Gould 1962).
The Edwards Plateau
vegetational area is characterized by a dissected plateau originally covered by
open savannah with trees and brush occupying rocky slopes and stream
bottoms. Today, the region is characterized by a predominate Live Oak-Ashe
Juniper woodland, interspersed with rangeland (Correl and Johnston 1979,
Hatch, S.L., K.N. Gandhi, and L.E. Brown 1990).
The project area lies near the eastern edge of the Balconian biotic province, near
its boundaries with the Tamaulipan and Texan biotic provinces (Blair 1950).
The Balconian province represents a transitional zone, where many wildlife
species are reaching the limits of their ecological tolerance (Blair 1950). The
eastern edge of the Balconian province is formed by the Balcones Escarpment,
which separates the Balconian from the Texan and Tamaulipan provinces of east
and south Texas, and forms a formidable barrier for faunal migration.
Numerous streams dissect the eastern and southern edges of the Balconian,

providing major avenues of dispersal for many species. Fifty-seven mammal
species, one land turtle species, 16 lizard species, 36 snake species, 15 anuran
species, and seven urodele species are known from the Balconian province.
Common avian species include mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), crested
caracara (Caracara plancus), northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), red-bellied
woodpecker (Melanerpes carolinus), western scrub-jay (Aphelocoma californica),
Bewick’s wren (Thryomanes bewickii), and painted bunting (Passerina ciris).
Terrestrial species observed include eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus),
white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus),
nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), redstripe ribbon snake
(Thamnophis proximus rubrilinetus), and six-lined racerunner (Cnemidophorus
sexlineatus).

LAND USE
The project area lies adjacent to the east and west banks of the San Marcos
River, north of East Hopkins Street in River Park, San Marcos, Texas (Figures 2
and 3). The land is currently used as a park with pedestrian jogging trails,
picnic areas, and open recreational areas. The small area of land within the
project area is undeveloped but adjacent areas have been developed for
roadways and commercial development. The Texas State University surrounds
the proposed project area. The proposed 150 foot construction easement area
located in the western portion of the project area was found to be disturbed
(Figure 4). Electrical wire has been run underground in this area to provide
electricity to the park and for tree lighting. Figure 5 depicts an underground
electric box in the vicinity of the proposed construction easement.

Cultural Background

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
The project area is located within the central Texas archeological region. Most of
the recent chronologies for central Texas are based on six distinct time periods,
representing roughly a 12,000 year sequence of occupation. A synthesis of the
culture-historical sequence from Collins (2004) and Johnson (1995) is as
follows: Paleoindian (prior to 8800 BP), Early Archaic (8800-5800 BP), Middle
Archaic (5800-4000 BP), Late Archaic (4000-1400 BP) and Post-Archaic or Late
Prehistoric (AD 600-1600), and Historic (AD 1600 to present). Although these
divisions represent convenient temporal categories, they are also based in large
part on perceived adaptations in subsistence, and are reflected in changes in
lithic and other technologies.
Paleoindian (prior to 8800 BP)
The early Paleoindian culture in south and central Texas is believed to be related
to the better known big game hunting tradition of the Great Plains (Hester
1980). Most of the well documented early Paleoindian sites in Texas that are
associated with extinct megafauna are located north and west of central Texas
on the Llano Estacado and adjacent areas of the Southern High Plains. In
general, early Paleoindian sites are scarce in central Texas or at least not as
visible as later sites. Conversely, later Paleoindian sites are much more
numerous in south and central Texas, although both are usually identified from
only surface-collected artifacts (Black and McGraw 1985). Subsistence data
from several late Paleoindian sites does suggest, however, that small game was
being exploited rather than extinct megafauna. This data supports the idea that
a hunting and gathering lifestyle may have already been adopted across much of
southwestern and central Texas prior to the Early Archaic period.
Paleoindian occupations in central Texas have typically been associated with
lanceolate projectile points such as Clovis, Folsom, Plainview, Golondrina,
Meserve and stemmed points such as Scottsbluff (Turner and Hester 1993).
Recent investigations at the Wilson Leonard Site (Collins 2004, 41WM235)
equate three styles of projectiles, Golondrina/Barber, St. Mary’s Hall and Wilson
to the Late Paleoindian period. The Wilson component is dated at 10,000-9650
BP (stemmed points) and is associated with features, a burial and artifacts that
are more Archaic-like in nature than Paleoindian (Collins 2004). The data from
the site further suggests that the Archaic nature of the adaptation continues
during the ensuing the Golondrina/Barber and St. Mary’s Hall components (see
below). These are dated between 9500 and 8800 BP and may represent a
transitional period between the Paleoindian and the Archaic.
Early Archaic (ca. 8800 - 5800 BP)
At the Wilson-Leonard Site (41WM235), the Early Archaic period is subdivided
into three projectile point style intervals, Angostura, Early Split Stem and
Martindale/Uvalde, from 8800-6000 BP (2004). At this site, the shift from
Paleoindian to Archaic subsistence strategies is measured by a change in
technology focused on the use of burned rocks to process geophyte plant foods.
This shift is traced as early as 8800 BP at the Wilson-Leonard site and at
roughly comparable ages at several other central Texas sites (Black et al. 1998;

Archeological Survey – San Marcus Pedestrian Bridge – May 2007

Cultural Background

Decker et al. 1999; Thoms et al. 1996). At these sites, the use of earth ovens
and burned rock technologies for the possible processing of plant foods is
associated with lanceolate Angostura projectile points. The use of Angostura
and late Paleoindian lithic technologies may have continued on into the Early
Archaic period for a time but was gradually replaced by the bifurcate base splitstem and Martindale/Uvalde styles.
The Early Archaic marks the shift to the use of multiple tons of burned
limestone and other rocks in the form of scatters, hearths, middens and other
features for the processing of plant foods. This represents the start of a long
lived Archaic cooking tradition which lasted from roughly 8800-1400 BP. This
tradition was characterized by the repeated utilization of earth ovens and the
creation of burned rock middens at strategic places on the landscape. These
new subsistence practices began with a distinctive cooking technology using
layered arrangements of heated rocks in earth ovens which allowed for the
exploitation of a broad range of geophytes. These included upland xerophytic
plants like sotol and other species such as Lily family onion bulbs which grow in
wetter environments (Decker et al. 1999).
Some of the most recent climatic reconstructions for the period posit a moist
and cool late Pleistocene environment with early to mid-Holocene shifts to drier
conditions that became most pronounced during the mid-Holocene (ca. 5000­
7000 BP, Ricklis and Collins 1994). In contrast, Johnson (1995) suggests that
the relatively mesic conditions of the eastern Edwards Plateau during the
Pleistocene and early Holocene/Paleoindian period witnessed a brief dry interval
during Late Paleoindian times, which later again became more mesic during the
ensuing Early Archaic period (roughly 8000-5800 BP). Whether the Early
Archaic climate reflects a gradual drying period (Ricklis and Collins 1994), or a
more mesic interval within an overall, long lived trend towards aridity along the
eastern Edwards Plateau, it appears that the use of burned rock midden
technologies for plant food and other types of subsistence related processing
began during this period and continued for many thousands of years.
Overall, the bulk of the central Texas archeological literature suggests that the
Early Archaic occupations were generally small, widely distributed, and non­
specialized (Black and McGraw 1985). Explanations for these characteristics
support a generalized hunting-gathering strategy involving relatively high group
mobility, poorly defined territories, and short-term occupations.
Broad
spectrum and well adapted, highly mobile subsistence strategies are theorized.
Regional population density may have been low, though this may reflect a
sampling bias in terms of well documented Early Archaic sites (Ricklis and
Collins 1994).
Middle Archaic (ca. 5800 - 4000 BP)
The Middle Archaic marks an intensification of the use of burned rock
technologies to process plant and other types of foods within an increasingly
arid environment. Ricklis and Collins (1994) recognize a pronounced midHolocene drying event which occurred from 7000-5000 BP, but which may have
lasted longer. Johnson (1995) posits the occurrence of a dry Edwards Interval
along the eastern Edwards Plateau from roughly 5500-1400 BP. Evidence for
this is the cessation of significant overbank sediment aggradation at a number
of central Texas sites. Instead of deposition, arid conditions caused extensive
downcutting and erosion along many central Texas streams. Dryer conditions
favored the spread of desert succulent xerophytic plants and fostered the

10

Cultural Background

proliferation of burned rock middens.
Dryer conditions may also have
engendered the return of bison to the plateau during the Middle and Late
Archaic Intervals. The proliferation of Bell/Andice/Calf Creek projectile point
styles at the beginning of the Middle Archaic may have coincided with the return
of bison to the Edwards Plateau and adjacent Blackland Prairie. These broad
bladed points may have been well adapted to the exploitation of bison.
Additional Middle Archaic styles include Early Triangular, La Jita, Nolan and
Travis.
Late Archaic (ca. 4000 - 1400 BP)
Recent refinements in the central Texas chronology divide the Late Archaic
interval into two different subperiods, I and II (Johnson 1995). Subperiod I is
marked by the appearance of Bulverde projectile points, which along with later
forms (Pedernales, Castroville, Marshall and Montell) were used to hunt bison
and other large game. Burned rock middens continued to proliferate during the
Late Archaic I interval. The resources processed may have included yucca,
sotol, and perhaps agave lechuguilla. Other middens may simply be dumps for
kitchen type debris which contain sizeable quantities of animal bones, broken
stone tools, and flint-knapping detritus (Johnson 1995). Pedernales peoples, in
particular, may have been adept at both hunting and the processing of large
volumes of plant food materials.
The Late Archaic II interval (ca. 600 BC-AD 600) may have been a time of
increasingly mesic conditions for all but the western and southwestern portions
of the Edwards Plateau (Johnson 1995). The onset of more mesic conditions
may have resulted in decreased numbers of upland xerophytic (dry weatheradapted) plants and perhaps bison (Johnson 1995), which may have forced
adjustments in prehistoric subsistence strategies. There appears to be a
decrease in the number of burned rock middens that can be directly attributable
to the Late Archaic II interval. The projectile points used at this time are smaller
and are characterized by such styles as Ensor, Fairland, Frio and Darl. The
large projectiles well adapted to bison hunting may have been gradually
replaced. There is evidence that the spread of Eastern Woodland religious cults
may have had an influence on the Late Archaic II peoples of central Texas
(Johnson 1995).
Late Prehistoric (ca. 600 AD - 1600)
The Late Prehistoric or Post-Archaic (ca. AD 600-1600) (Johnson 1995) in
central Texas is marked initially by the replacement of the dart and atlatl with
the bow and arrow, as reflected in the shift from dart points to smaller, thinner
and lighter arrow points (Ricklis and Collins 1994). Despite the shift to the bow
and arrow, there is every indication that the broad based hunting-gathering
economy of the Late Archaic persisted into and through most of the Late
Prehistoric period. The latter part of this period is marked by the appearance of
pottery and a distinctive complex of tools composed of contracting-stem Perdiz
arrow points, an abundance of unifacial end scrapers, thin, alternately beveled
bifacial knives, and drills or perforators made on flakes and blades. The PostArchaic era again turned dry and somewhat arid towards the middle of the Late
Prehistoric, during which there was a rather dramatic increase in the bison
exploitation. It appears that bison hunting became an increasingly important
economic activity during the later part of this period.

Cultural Background

During the Late Prehistoric period, a trade route was established by Jumano
traders working a circuit that included the Llano Estacado, the Hasinai
Confederacy, Indians living along the Balcones Escarpment, and Indians of
southwest Texas. The trade route maximized the utilization of the springs
emanating from the edge of the escarpment, including those of the San Marcos
area. Later, in the Historic period, Spanish officials and explorers made use of
this route which eventually became a part of the Camino Real de los Tejas.

HISTORIC PERIOD (AD 1528 – PRESENT)
The most radical changes in the Native American history of central Texas came
during the historic era (Black 1989). The horse was introduced into North
America by the Spanish in the sixteenth century. Nomadic groups, initially the
Apaches and later the Comanches, adopted the horse and rapidly altered the
aboriginal situation of central Texas. These nomadic groups entered central
Texas from the plains and mountain areas to the north and west and within 150
years had forced most of the native peoples to flee. Most groups were simply
destroyed by the combined effects of the nomadic raiders and the foreign
diseases introduced by the Europeans. Others moved south entering Spanish
missions and settlements, or eastward to join various agricultural groups such
as the Wichita (Black 1989).
The historic period in Texas begins with the arrival of Alvar Nunez Cabeza de
Vaca and other survivors of the Navarez expedition on the Texas coast in 1528,
although there may have been earlier landings. In any case, the influences of
European colonization were not felt strongly in Texas for several centuries. By
the middle of the eighteenth century, however, the Spanish had established
missions in east Texas and settlements in south Texas. This resulted in massive
depopulation and cultural disintegration among native Indian groups.
The first Europeans to visit the area of present-day Hays County were probably
members of the Espinosa-Olivares-Aguirre expedition of 1709. In 1755, the
Spaniards established the mission San Xavier and the presidio San Francisco
Xavier which quickly succumbed to Indian attacks.
The area remained
unsettled for another half century. In the early nineteenth century, the Spanish
made another attempt with the settlement of San Marcos de Neve. Spanish
officials sought to increase the population of Texas in response to the Louisiana
Purchase. This settlement lasted until 1812 when unrelenting Comanche raids
and floods forced abandonment of the settlement. The area continued to be
traversed by Spanish and later Mexican travelers on the Old San Antonio Road
that ran between northern New Mexico and Nacogdoches. Between the 1830s
and 1840s the first white settlers moved into the area. In 1848, Hays County,
named for Texas Ranger John Coffee Hays, was organized.
The young
community of San Marcos was chosen as the county seat. The small town
continued to grow and became a trade center between Austin and San Antonio.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
The central Texas archeological area is one of the better known regions of the
state. More sites have been recorded, tested, and excavated in central Texas
than any other part of the state (Black 1989). Most of the prehistoric sites in
central Texas are open, unprotected sites sitting or situated on alluvial terraces
adjacent to streams or rivers (Black 1989). A typical open site in central Texas
contains refuse such as chert flaking debris, broken chert tools, fragmented

Cultural Background

burned rock, land snails, fragmented animal bone (uncommon), and charred
plant remains (rare) (Black 1989). Burned rock middens are central Texas’ most
characteristic archeological feature. These fire-cracked and discolored limestone
features are found in terrace or upland settings. They usually contain other
cultural debris in association, indicating their significant role in prehistoric open
occupations. An additional trait of open sites is the presence of diagnostic stone
tools often representing occupations from different periods or phases and
ultimately suggesting repeated use over hundreds or perhaps thousands of
years.
Many of the intensive archeological investigations of Hays County have occurred
in the vicinity of San Marcos Springs. The San Marcos Springs, which are the
second largest natural cluster of springs in Texas, issue from fissures in the
Edwards Limestone below what today is Spring Lake. These investigations have
yielded evidence of human occupation and exploitation of the springs for more
than 8,000 years. Additionally, more than 200 archeological sites have been
recorded across Hays County.
Previous archeological research clearly indicates that the areas adjacent to the
San Marcos River in the proposed project area have a high probability for
stratified and buried historic and prehistoric archeological sites. Investigations
at several sites have demonstrated the presence of intact archeological deposits
from 70 centimeters to over one meter in depth. Though previous archeological
survey in the area of the proposed pedestrian bridge has not indicated the
presence of archeological materials on the surface, no subsurface testing has
been conducted and there exists a high probability for buried sites or buried
components of sites previously recorded to exist.
A review of the archival records was conducted utilizing the Texas Historical
Commission’s Archeological Sites Atlas and at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL). Research indicates that the proposed project area was first
surveyed in 1977 by James Warren for the Soil Conservation Service (CSC) as
part of an aerial survey for the San Marcos Riverfront Park. Several additional
linear surveys have also been conducted in the immediate vicinity, but these do
not cross the proposed project area.
These previous investigations have
identified the following eight archeological sites in a 1000 meter radius of the
proposed pedestrian bridge location (Figure 1): 41HY133, 41HY134, 41HY135,
41HY141, 41HY161, 41HY165, 41HY261 and 41HY319.
All sites except
41HY261 and 41HY319 are listed as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs) in
the THC Sites Atlas. None of these previously recorded archeological sites were
located within the proposed project area.
In 1977, James Warren conducted a reconnaissance archeological survey for
the Upper San Marcos River project. Four archeological sites (41HY133,
41HY134, 41HY135, and 41HY141) were documented during the survey near
the project area. Sites 41HY133 and 41HY141 were recorded as prehistoric sites
with small historic components. Artifacts recovered at Site 41HY133 include
lithic debitage, cores, scrapers, utilized flakes, an Ensor point, burned bone and
limestone, glass and nails. Artifacts documented at Site 41HY141 include lithic
debitage, a possible glass bead, burned limestone, glass, brick, and crockery.
Sites 41HY134 and 41HY135 were recorded as prehistoric small lithic scatters.
Subsurface testing was recommended for all four sites to determine NRHP
eligibility. All of these sites were listed as a SAL’s in 1987. On the west bank of
the San Marcos River across from 41HY134 is site 41HY261, a multicomponent
historic/prehistoric site with a mill component that was first recorded in 1994

Cultural Background

by archeologists for Garza Engineers. The site, located 2730 feet (832 meters)
south of the proposed pedestrian bridge, was subsequently tested in 1997 and
2002. The results of these investigations indicate that in addition to a historic
era mill site, there is a deeply stratified prehistoric component with cultural
deposits present to 1.8 meters in depth below the surface and possibly deeper.
Site 41HY161 is located 583 meters north of the proposed pedestrian bridge on
the southwest bank of the San Marcos River. First surveyed and tested by Dr.
Joel Shiner in 1979, the site was found to have an Archaic period subsurface
component. The site was registered in 1987 as a State Archeological Landmark.
Additional excavations were conducted at the site by the Center for Archeological
Studies in 2004, confirming the presence of an intact Early Archaic occupation.
Site 41HY165 is located 766 meters from the proposed project area on the
southeast shore of Spring Lake. The site was excavated in 1982 by the
Southwest Texas State University Fieldschool. The site is buried and partially
covered by the lake. It was registered in 1999 as a State Archeological
Landmark.
The final site, 41HY319, is located on the east side of the San Marcos River 90
meters northeast of the planned bridge. This site was recorded by Center for
Archeological Studies archeologists in 2002 and was found to consist of a
surface scatter of prehistoric artifacts with subsurface deposits of cultural
material to a depth of 70 centimeters, the upper 50 centimeters of which was
disturbed. At the time of the survey, no further work was recommended unless
additional construction was to occur in the site area. This site is the closest to
the proposed project area.

Results of Field Investigations

RESULTS OF FIELD INVESTIGATIONS
Hicks & Company archeologists conducted an archeological survey for the
proposed City of San Marcos pedestrian bridge spanning the San Marcos River
in Hays County, Texas (Figure 1). The field survey was conducted on March 6 –
7, 2007. The linear project area is estimated to be 8 to 10 feet wide and
approximately 195 feet long, and located north of East Hopkins Street in River
Park, San Marcos, Texas. The project area, including a 150 foot construction
easement situated west of the proposed bridge, is approximately 345 feet in
length and 100 feet in width, totaling approximately 34,500 square feet (0.79
acres) (Figures 2-4). The project was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit
(TAC) No. 4443. The investigators inventoried the entire project area for cultural
resources. A total of five shovel tests were excavated within the project area,
with one (ST 4) being positive for cultural resources. A total of three backhoe
trenches (BHT 1, BHT 2, and BHT 3) were excavated within the project corridor,
with two (BHT 2 and BHT 3) being positive for cultural resources. A single newly
recorded archeological site (41HY432) was recorded during the current survey
(Figure 6). A discussion of the methods, trench excavations, site description,
and recommendations follows.

METHODOLOGY
Shovel tests were distributed at approximately 10-meter (32.8 feet) intervals
across the proposed project area. All shovel tests were terminated at a
maximum depth of 100 centimeters below ground surface, unless pre-Holocene
deposits or extremely dense clay was encountered. Additionally, no fewer than
six shovel tests and/or backhoe trenches were excavated at each archeological
site location in order to delineate site boundaries relative to the project area and
evaluate the site in terms of context, depth, artifact content, and definitive
characteristics. All excavated soil was screened through ¼-inch wire mesh.
Each shovel test was recorded in 10-centimeter levels on standardized forms
and plotted onto a site sketch map and/or an aerial photograph of the project
area. The walls and bottom of each shovel test were cleaned with a trowel to
examine the stratigraphy and any evidence of historic and prehistoric activity; a
soil profile was recorded for each shovel test. Once these data were recorded, all
of the shovel tests were backfilled. The results of each shovel test were
documented through standardized forms, field notes, and photographs. Areas of
disturbance were noted and recorded through photographs. Artifacts from all
subsurface tests were documented, photographed, and returned to the site area.
All site records will be recorded and submitted electronically to TARL for
inclusion in their database.
Backhoe excavations were designed to remove consecutive layers of earth in
order to locate and expose cultural features or occupation levels within the
upper terrace of the San Marcos River. The backhoe employed a toothless
bucket to excavate trenches. Backhoe trenches were excavated to the maximum
reach of the backhoe, which is approximately 8 to 9 feet. Backhoe excavations
were directed and monitored by an archeologist certified as a competent person
trained in OSHA trench safety standards. Each backhoe trench was recorded on
a standardized form, with notes made for stratigraphy, features, and cultural
artifacts. A soil profile, plan view map, and photographs were recorded for each
trench. After these data were recorded, the backhoe trenches were backfilled.

Results of Field Investigations

Investigators used a Trimble XT GPS unit and detailed maps to locate and
record excavations within the proposed project area. GPS positions were
recorded for all shovel tests and backhoe trenches. All GPS positions were
downloaded and plotted on 7.5 minute USGS topographic maps by Hicks &
Company GIS personnel.

TRENCH EXCAVATION SUMMARY
Three backhoe trenches were excavated within the proposed San Marcos
Pedestrian Bridge project area. BHT 1 was excavated on the west bank and BHT
2 and BHT 3 were excavated on the east bank of the San Marcos River within
the proposed project area (Figures 7-9). Trenching took place along the edge of
the upper terrace and the sloping side bank where the City of San Marcos plans
to utilize concrete abutments to anchor the ends of the proposed pedestrian
bridge.

Results of Field Investigations

Trenches were excavated to a depth range of 2.3 to 2.5 meters in depth, the
maximum reach of the bucket. Sediment from the trenches was screened at a
rate of every third bucket. BHT 1 revealed completely different stratigraphy than
that observed in BHT 2 and BHT 3 (Figure 10). The soil profile for BHT 1 was a
yellowish red (5YR4/6) clay loam between 0-70 cmbs overlying a yellowish red
(5YR4/6) clay loam with yellowish mottles from 70-150 cmbs. Below this zone
was a yellowish red (5YR4/6) dense clay with no mottling from 150-250 cmbs.
No cultural material was encountered in BHT 1.

BHT 2 and BHT 3 revealed roughly similar soil profiles (Figure 10). The typical
soil profile is characterized by a disturbed zone of very dark brown (10YR2/2)
clay loam between 0-30 cmbs underlain by a transitional zone of dark grayish
brown (10YR4/2) clay loam between a depth of 30-60 cmbs. Below this
sediment is a zone of yellowish brown (5YR4/6) clay from 60-200 cmbs.
Underlying these soils is a yellowish brown (5YR4/6) clay with gravels between a
depth of 200 – 250 cmbs. Typically the upper 30 centimeters contains a
disturbed clay loam lens having a mixture of modern, historic, and prehistoric
materials. The upper 60 centimeters contain the loamiest soils underlain by
clay that increases in density by depth. All three trenches revealed a consistent
yellowish red sediment color. Gravels were typically encountered around 200
centimeters below the ground surface. The presence of gravels could possibly
indicate the remnants of the old river channel. Artifacts recovered in BHT 2
included a disturbed mix of modern and prehistoric materials in the upper 30
cm (green and brown bottle glass, two burned rocks, one edge modified flake,
and a bone fragment) and a burned rock and flake near 70 cmbs (Figure 11: ac). Artifacts recorded in BHT 3 consisted of modern materials, including a dime
and an aluminum can pull tab, mixed with prehistoric materials (two broken
flakes) from the upper 30 centimeters, an edge modified flake at 50 cmbs and a
biface fragment with a concave base recovered around 70 cmbs (Figure 11: D-I).

SITE DESCRIPTION (41HY432)
Site 41HY432 is an undetermined prehistoric site located within the project
area on the east bank of the San Marcos River. The site consists of a very low
density of artifacts recovered in BHT 2, BHT 3, and ST 4 with undisturbed
prehistoric deposits between 30-70 cmbs. As currently defined the site area is
approximately 20 meter north-south by 15 meter east-west in size but current
investigations considered only those portions of the site within the area-of­
potential effect (APE).
The site is bounded to the north and east by the
proposed project area, to the south by a negative backhoe trench and three
negative shovel tests, and to the west by a gully and the embankment of East
Hopkins Street. It is likely that the site boundaries extend outside of the
proposed area to the north and east. Furthermore, the site may be associated
with previously recorded site 41HY319, which is located approximately 100
meters north, on the east side of the river. The depth of recovery and cultural
materials at Site 41HY319 are similar to those documented for Site 41HY432.
Site 41HY432 contained disturbed soils mixed with modern and prehistoric
material in the upper 30 centimeters. Shovel tests 1-5 were excavated on the
east and west banks of the San Marcos River within the project area, with ST 4
being the only one positive for cultural resources. ST 4 contained modern glass
and a single piece of debitage in the upper 30 centimeters and a single edge

modified flake between 50-60 cmbs (Figure 11: J). Shovel tests were terminated
at a depth of 80-85 cmbs due to extremely dense clay.
As mentioned above, BHT 2 and BHT 3 contained a mixture disturbed materials
in the upper 30 centimeters. BHT 2 artifacts associated with Site 41HY432
included an edge modified flake, a piece of debitage and two burned rocks
recovered around 30 cmbs and a burned rock and flake recovered at 70 cmbs
(Figure 11: A-C). Cultural materials associated with BHT 3 included two
broken flakes mixed with modern materials in the upper 30 cmbs, an edge
modified flake found at 50 cmbs and a biface fragment recovered around 70
cmbs (Figure 11: D-I). The recovered flakes and tools consist of at least two
different types of material - a dark black/grey chert and brown chert – though
these all appear to be locally available materials.
In summary, Site 41HY432 consists of a zone of low density prehistoric artifact
recovery located between approximately 30-70 cmbs on the upper terrace of the
east bank of the San Marcos River. During the investigations no diagnostic
artifacts were recovered, and intrusive modern materials such as glass and
metal were observed within the upper 30 centimeters of the deposit. No
archeological features or intact occupational surfaces were encountered in any
of the excavated shovel tests or backhoe trenches, nor were any visible in the
profiles.
Current investigations indicate that the portions of Site 41HY432 in the project
APE do not have characteristics that would qualify the site for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) under Criterion D or for formal
designation as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL). The portion of Site
41HY432 investigated within the proposed project area therefore warrants no
further archeological investigation. Since 41HY432 possibly extends to the
north and east outside of the proposed project area, additional archeological
work is recommended if construction activities extend outside the proposed
project area.

Conclusions and Recommendations

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Between March 5-6, 2007, Hicks & Company conducted an archeological survey
of the proposed San Marcos Pedestrian Bridge project in San Marcos, Texas, on
behalf of the City of San Marcos. The project was conducted at the request of
the City of San Marcos for regulatory and management purposes under Section
106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) and the Antiquities Code of
Texas (13 TAC 26). The current study was conducted under Texas Antiquity
Permit (TAC) No. 4443. All work complied with the guidelines set out under 36
CFR 800 which outlines the procedures for Section 106 implementation and
compliance and is consistent with the THC minimum survey standards in high
probability areas and the rules of practice and procedure for the Texas
Antiquities Code. The proposed linear project area is approximately 345 feet in
length and 100 feet wide, including a 150 foot construction easement west of the
proposed bridge, totaling an area of approximately 34,500 square feet (0.79
acres).
Investigations involved a combination of pedestrian survey supplemented with
shovel testing and backhoe trench excavations to identify and evaluate the
horizontal and vertical extent of archeological deposits within the proposed
project area. A total of five shovel tests and three backhoe trenches were
excavated within the project area. A single newly recorded archeological site
(41HY432) was documented during the current study.
Site 41HY432 is an undetermined prehistoric site located within the project
area on the east bank of the San Marcos River. The site consists of a low
density lithic scatter and is considered to have poor integrity. The site lacks
diagnostic artifacts, features, or other interpretable cultural material. The site is
bounded to the north and east by the proposed project area, to the south by
negative shovel tests, and to the west by East Hopkins Street. It is likely that
the site boundaries extend outside of the proposed project area to the north and
east. Furthermore, the site may be associated with previously recorded Site
41HY319, which is located approximately 100 meters north, on the east side of
the river. The depth of recovery and cultural materials at Site 41HY319 are
similar to artifacts documented at Site 41HY432.
Current investigations
indicate that the portions of Site 41HY432 within the proposed project area do
not have characteristics that would qualify the site for inclusion in the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) under Criterion D or for formal designation as
a State Archeological Landmark (SAL). Site 41HY432 warrants no further
archeological investigation. Site 41HY432, however, most likely extends to the
north and east outside of the current project area, therefore, further
archeological work is warranted if construction activities extend to the north and
east of the proposed project area.
Based on the results of this survey, it is concluded that the proposed project will
have no effect on any historic properties that are considered eligible or
potentially eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or as SAL’s. It is recommended
that the proposed pedestrian bridge project should be allowed to proceed to
construction, relative to the requirements under Section 106 of the NHPA and
the Antiquities Code of Texas.
