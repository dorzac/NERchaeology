ABSTRACT
This report details the results of an intensive archaeological survey by SWCA Environmental
Consultants (SWCA) for the proposed Ramsey North Residue Line (Residue Line). The 51-cmdiameter (20-inch-diameter) Residue Line will be located in Reeves and Culberson Counties,
Texas (2.35 and 7.21 km [1.46 and 4.48 miles], respectively) and Eddy County, New Mexico
(4.83 km [3.0 miles]). The line will start at the Ramsey Gas Plant in Reeves County, Texas, and
then run northwest for approximately 14.5 km (9 miles), largely following existing rights-of-way
(ROWs). The Residue Line will be constructed in a 15-m-wide (50-foot-wide) ROW. The 15-m
(50-foot) ROW in Texas and New Mexico will consist of 6 m (20 feet) of temporary ROW to be
used only during construction and 9 m (30 feet) of permanent ROW. The pipeline will be strung
along the pipeline route as it arrives at the site, so there will be no additional staging areas
needed. Five horizontal direction drills (HDDs) are anticipated at two county road crossings, the
crossing of the Delaware River, crossing an historic ditch, and at an abandoned railroad grade. In
addition to proposed pipeline, there is also a proposed surface facility that will be located on a 61
× 61–m (200 × 200–foot) (approximately 1-acre) site with a short (75 m; 245 feet) access road.
The surface facility will include a coalesce separator, a measuring station that will meter the gas
prior to the tie-in with the KM lines, and a temporary diesel generator until a permanent power
source is available. This report includes the findings of the cultural resources investigations
within the Texas portion of the project.
Sound Environmental Solutions, Inc. selected SWCA to conduct an intensive pedestrian
archaeological survey of the area of potential effect (APE) to aid in complying with Section 106
of the National Historic Preservation Act. The fieldwork was completed between February 11
and 19, 2015. The Texas portion of the project is entirely on private lands with the exception of
one small segment that crosses state lands. The project will be permitted by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC) as well as the Texas Historical Commission (THC) (Antiquities
Permit #7262), which is mandated by the inclusion of public lands within the project APE.
The SWCA archaeological investigations were conducted within a 45.7-m-wide (150-foot-wide)
corridor totaling approximately 9.56 km (5.94 miles) of the overall project length within Texas.
The Texas portion of the project area is depicted on the Red Bluff and Screw Bean Draw NE
U.S. Geological Survey 7.5-minute topographic quadrangles. The survey in Texas recorded one
newly discovered archaeological site (41CU804). The site is an abandoned railroad grade with an
associated historic assemblage and is recommended undetermined for the National Register of
Historic Places. The site will be avoided by boring under the site, and there will be no impact to
the site. No further management is recommended for this site associated with this project.
In accordance with 33 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 325, Appendix C, and Section 106 of
the National Historic Preservation Act (36 CFR 800.4), SWCA has made a reasonable and good
faith effort to identify historic properties within the proposed project area. Based on the results of
the current effort, it is SWCA’s opinion that the proposed Texas portion of the project would
have no adverse effect on significant cultural resources within the investigated project area. As
such, SWCA recommends no further archaeological investigations within the investigated
project area and that the project be allowed to proceed.

1 DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
This report details the results of an intensive archaeological survey by SWCA Environmental
Consultants (SWCA) for the proposed Ramsey North Residue Line (Residue Line). The 20-inchdiameter Residue Line will be located in Reeves and Culberson Counties, Texas (2.35 and 7.21
km [1.46 and 4.48 miles], respectively) and Eddy County, New Mexico (4.83 km [3.0 miles]).
(Figure 1.1–Figure 1.4). The line will start at the Ramsey Gas Plant in Reeves County, Texas,
and then run north-northwest for approximately 14.5 km (9 miles), largely following existing
rights-of-way (ROWs). The Residue Line will be constructed in a 15-m-wide (50-foot-wide)
ROW. Five horizontal direction drills (HDDs) are anticipated at county road crossings, the
crossing of the Delaware River, crossing an historic ditch, and at an abandoned railroad grade.
This report includes the findings of the cultural resources investigations within the Texas portion
of the project.
Sound Environmental Solutions, Inc. (SES) selected SWCA Environmental Consultants
(SWCA) to conduct an intensive pedestrian archaeological survey of the area of potential effect
(APE) to aid in complying with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. The
fieldwork was completed between February 11 and 19 and April 23, 2015. The Texas portion of
the project is entirely on private lands with the exception of one small segment that crosses state
lands (Figure 1.5). The project will be permitted by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC) as well as the Texas Historical Commission (Antiquities Permit #7262), which is
mandated by the inclusion of public lands within the project APE.
DBM Pipeline, LLC (DBM), proposes to construct, own, and operate the Residue Line, which
will transport processed natural gas from the Ramsey Gas Plant to a Kinder Morgan line. The
equipment required to construct the pipeline would include vehicles, trenchers, trackhoes,
sidebooms, other tractors, cranes, and flatbed trailers. DBM is requesting a 15-m-wide (50-footwide) construction ROW during the installation of the proposed pipeline. The 15-m (50-foot)
ROW in Texas and New Mexico will consist of 6 m (20 feet) of temporary ROW to be used only
during construction and 9 m (30 feet) of permanent ROW. The pipeline will be strung along the
pipeline route as it arrives at the site, so there will be no additional staging areas needed.
In addition to proposed pipeline, there is also a proposed surface facility that will be located on a
61 × 61–m (200 × 200–foot) (approximately 1-acre) site with a short (75 m; 245 feet) access
road. The surface facility will include a coalesce separator, a measuring station that will meter
the gas prior to the tie-in with the KM lines, and a temporary diesel generator until a permanent
power source is available. The legal descriptions for the proposed Residue Line and associated
facilities are given in Table 1.1, and is based on the survey corridor width of 150 feet and 1 acre
block areas for the surface facility and HDD locations.

2 ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT
The project area occurs within the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Chihuahuan Basins
and Playas (24a) ecoregion (Griffith et al. 2004). The Chihuahuan Basins and Playas ecoregion
includes alluvial fans, internally drained basins, and river valleys mostly below 1,372 m (4,500
feet). These low elevation areas are some of the hottest and most arid habitats in the state. The
playas and basin floors have saline or alkaline soils and areas of salt flats, dunes, and windblown
sand. The elevation of the project area ranges from approximately 907 to 927 m (2,975–3,040
feet) above mean sea level. The terrain is nearly flat at the south end of the area and becomes
gently rolling at the north end, particularly just north and south of the Delaware River. Climate
for this area, based on the climatic records for Carlsbad National Park, New Mexico, has an
average annual maximum temperature of 25.4 degrees Celsius (°C) (77.8 degrees Fahrenheit
[°F]), with an average annual minimum temperature of 9.3°C (48.7°F). The average annual
precipitation is 30.58 cm (12.04 inches) with the majority occurring between May and October,
while the average annual total snowfall is 16.26 cm (6.4 inches), which largely occurs between
December and February. The weather during the surveys was cool, breezy and partly sunny to
overcast.

2.1 FLORA AND FAUNA
The project is located in Chihuahuan Desert scrub habitat (Brown 1994). The project area is
primarily in an area dominated by creosotebush and honey mesquite shrubs with a sparse
understory of grasses and forbs. The ROW passes through an extensive series of areas that are
playa-like: slightly depressed areas that collect water after a significant precipitation event.
These areas have larger and denser shrub cover, including American tarwort (or tarbush) and a
dense understory of tobosagrass, vine mesquite, and other grasses. Other shrub species include
catclaw acacia, whitethorn acacia, soaptree yucca, purple pricklypear, and fourwing saltbush.
Forb species include copper globemallow, stemless Townsend daisy, bladderpod, broom
snakeweed, dwarf desertpeony, and Dakota mock vervain. Additional grass species are purple
threeawn, Texas dropseed, and blue grama. There are also patches of gypsum soil that have
gypsophilic plant cover, including hairy crinklemat and gypsum grama.
The most common animals found in the region are mule deer and coyote. Also typical to the area
are bobcat, gopher, jackrabbit, peccary, various species of field mice, striped skunk, and pack rat
(Biota Information System of New Mexico 2014). There are a variety of birds, including
mourning doves and hawks; numerous lizards and snakes are also in the project area. Lizards
were the most commonly observed animal during the survey. Prehistorically, bison were in the
region in at least some periods. Bison, antelope, deer, and rabbit were important food resources
for the prehistoric inhabitants.

2.2 GEOLOGY
The project area is in the Interior Plain Geologic Province. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
reports that
The Interior Plains is a vast region that spreads across the stable core (craton) of
North America. This area had formed when several small continents collided and

welded together well over a billion years ago, during the Precambrian. Precambrian
metamorphic and igneous rocks now form the basement of the Interior Plains and
make up the stable nucleus of North America. With the exception of the Black Hills
of South Dakota, the entire region has low relief, reflecting more than 500 million
years of relative tectonic stability. (USGS 2015)

2.3 SOILS
There are nine principal soil types in the project area, which are described in Table 2.1 with acres
and percentages based on the surveyed ROW width of 150 feet and 1 acre each for the surface
facility and HDD locations. Dellahunt silt loam is found on 0 to 5 percent slopes and
occasionally floods. It is typically found on alluvial flats and is composed of loamy alluvium
derived from rock gypsum and/or sandstone. Depth to a restrictive feature (bedrock or water
table) is more than 203.2 cm (80 inches), and it is a well-drained class of soil. The land
capability class (non-irrigated) is severely restricted, primarily due to dry climate.

The Dellahunt-Neimahr-Joberanch complex is found on 1 to 3 percent slopes on alluvial flats.
Neimahr is a shallow soil, only 20.3 to 50.8 cm (8–20 inches) to bedrock. It is well drained and
the soil capability class is severely restricted due to shallowness, drought and/or stony character.
Joberanch is also a shallow soil, 25.4 to 45.7 cm (10–18 inches) over a petrogypsic restrictive
layer. It is well drained and restricted in the same manner as Neimahr.
The Elcor-Dellahunt-Pokorny complex is found on 0 to 2 percent slopes. Elcor is a residuum
weathered from rock gypsum and is shallow, 15.2 to 50.8 cm (6–20 inches) to lithic bedrock,
found on hilly terrain. It is well drained and the depth to the water table is greater than 203.2 cm
(80 inches). The land capability class (non-irrigated) is extremely limited due to shallowness,
drought, and/or stony character. Pokorny is generally located on alluvial flats and terraces and is
composed of gypsiferous alluvium. It is also shallow, 10.2 to 50.8 cm (4–20 inches) to a
petrogypsic restrictive layer. Its land capability is severely restricted in the same manner as
Elcor. These three soil groups are located in the Culberson County area.
In Reeves County there are two principal soil types. The Holloman-Reeves association is found
on hill slopes in gently undulating terrain. This is a shallow, well-drained soil with a gypsiferous
component. Depth to paralithic bedrock in the Holloman is 5.1 to 50.8 cm (2–20 inches). In the
Reeves component, depth extends more than 203.2 cm (80 inches) to a restrictive feature
(bedrock or water table). Land capability (non-irrigated) is extremely limited, primarily due to
erosion, shallowness, drought, and/or stony character. The Reaker association is found in nearly

level terrain at the south end of the project area. It is composed of loam and clay loam, is well
drained, and the depth to restrictive layer is more than 203.2 cm (80 inches). Land capability
(non-irrigated) is extremely limited due to erosion.
Regarding previous disturbances, much of the area has been moderately to severely adversely
impacted by years of construction, infrastructure, and development primarily from the oil and
gas industry. Areas of the project area have also had animal grazing for decades.

3 RESEARCH DESIGN
Based on a review of the project area soils, geology, recorded archaeological sites, and the
results of previously conducted surveys in the vicinity of the project area, SWCA proposed to
conduct an intensive pedestrian survey within the project area. The goal of the work was to
locate all prehistoric and historic archeological sites in the APE, establish vertical and horizontal
site boundaries as appropriate with regard to the APE, and evaluate the significance and
eligibility of any site recorded in the APE for listing in the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) and designation as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL). All work was done in
accordance with the standards and guidelines of the Antiquities Code of Texas (13 Texas
Administrative Code [TAC] 26.20), Texas Historical Commission (THC) policy, and the
National Historic Preservation Act. The overall approach ensures that all project-related impacts
are investigated thoroughly for their potential to affect cultural resources.
If an archaeological site was encountered in the proposed project area during the investigation, it
would be explored as much as possible with consideration to land access constraints. Any
discovered sites would be assessed in regards to potential significance so that recommendations
can be made for proper management (avoidance, non-avoidance, or further work). Additionally,
shovel tests would be completed per THC standards at any discovered sites to define horizontal
and vertical boundaries and to aid in eligibility determinations. Appropriate State of Texas
Archaeological Site Data Forms would be filled out for each site discovered during the
investigations. A detailed plan map of each site would be produced and locations plotted on
USGS 7.5-minute topographic quadrangles and relevant project maps. SWCA proposed a noncollection survey. Artifacts would be tabulated, analyzed, and documented in the field, but not
collected. Temporally diagnostic artifacts would be described in detail and photographed in the
field.

3.1 ANTICIPATED RESULTS
Considering the setting of the APE, there was generally a low probability that intact, buried
prehistoric cultural resources sites would be encountered within the project area. Extensive
previously constructed pipelines within and adjacent to the proposed project area suggested a
low probability of identifying any new cultural resources.

3.2 ANALYSIS, REPORT PREPARATION, AND CURATION
Once the archaeological survey has been completed, SWCA will analyze the field data and
produce a report of the investigations. A no-collection survey would be completed and no
artifacts would require curation. Analysis of field data will include mapping, the production of
official State of Texas site forms for all documented sites and the acquisition of trinomials from
the Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory (TARL), analysis and tabulation of shovel tests
and results, and the review, organization, and assessment of field notes. Once this is complete,
SWCA will prepare a report of the investigations. The report will be in compliance with
reporting standards of 13 TAC 26.24, as well as Council of Texas Archeologists reporting
guidelines. The archaeological report will document previous investigations in the area,
background cultural settings, the methodology used in the investigations, the presence and

condition of any previously recorded sites revealed in the records review, the general nature and
extent of cultural resources encountered during the archaeological survey, the ownership of the
land for each site location, recommendations on the need for further work, and the potential
significance of the cultural resources in regards to future development and eligibility for listing
as an SAL or on the NRHP. The report will contain recommendations for further work, if
necessary, on the project with appropriate justifications based on the requirements of 13 TAC
26.20 and defined in 13 TAC 26.5.
Draft copies of the report will be submitted to SES for review and comment. Once this has been
accomplished, any appropriate edits will be made and SES will submit copies of the report to
FERC. SWCA will submit copies to THC, and any other relevant agencies. Once the reporting
process is complete, two paper copies of the final report and one electronic copy (CDs with the
electronic document in tagged PDF format) will be submitted to THC. An additional 10 hard
copies of the final report will be sent to various designated repositories throughout the state, as
required by the Texas Historical Commission (Antiquities Permit #7262).

4 PREVIOUS RESEARCH
4.1 BACKGROUND REVIEW
SWCA performed a cultural resources file records review on February 11, 2015, to determine
whether the project area has been previously surveyed for cultural resources and whether any
archaeological sites have been recorded in or near the project area. To conduct this review,
SWCA archaeologist Greg Mastropietro reviewed the USGS Red Bluff and Screw Bean Draw
NE, Texas/New Mexico 7.5-minute quadrangles at the TARL and searched the THC Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) database and site files at TARL. These sources provide
information on the nature and location of previously conducted archaeological surveys,
previously recorded cultural resource sites, locations of NRHP properties, sites designated as
SALs, Official Texas Historical Markers, Registered Texas Historic Landmarks, cemeteries, and
local neighborhood surveys. No previous survey investigations have been conducted in the
project area and no previously recorded sites were located within the project area.

5 RESULTS
SWCA archaeologists Greg Mastropietro conducted an online records search of the TARL
database, which revealed no previously recorded sites or previously conducted archaeological
surveys within 1.6 km (1 mile) of the project area in the Texas portion of the proposed project.

5.1 NEWLY RECORDED CULTURAL RESOURCES
The goal of the archaeological survey was to locate all prehistoric and historic archaeological
sites in the defined APE, establish vertical and horizontal site boundaries as appropriate, and
evaluate the significance and eligibility of any sites recorded for designation as an SAL. An
Antiquities Permit was obtained (#7262). SWCA conducted an intensive 100 percent ground
coverage archaeological field survey of the proposed project area. The survey was of sufficient
intensity to determine the nature, extent, and, significance of cultural resources located within the
proposed project area. An additional 15-m (50-foot) buffer was added to the survey. This buffer
was also a part of the intensive survey. The survey was conducted at 15-m (50-foot) intervals in
parallel transects within the project area. Temporally diagnostic artifacts, if present, were to be
described in detail and photographed in the field. Only especially rare artifacts or discoveries
were to be collected.
On February 11 through 19, 2015, SWCA archaeologists Greg Mastropietro and Nina Williams
conducted an intensive pedestrian survey of the project area. Proposed reroutes and additional
work areas were surveyed by Greg Mastropietro on April 23, 2015. Two new archaeological
sites, four previously-identified archaeological sites, and 19 isolated manifestations were
identified during both the New Mexico and Texas portions of the survey. The intensive
pedestrian field survey consisted of SWCA archaeologists walking over the proposed project
area. The 116.3 acres in the Texas portion of the project area were intensively surveyed. SWCA
assumed that the surface-visibility percentage would be high enough that no shovel tests would
be necessary. One archaeological site and 13 isolated manifestations were newly recorded in the
Texas portion of this project.

Site Description
This archaeological site is an abandoned railroad grade and bed with associated artifacts (Figure
5.1). The portion recorded as 41CU804 is a small portion of a much longer linear site. Its
proximity to the original alignment of the Pecos Valley Railroad, completed in 1891 connecting
Pecos, Texas, to Eddy, New Mexico, suggests this site is a spur. The site, within the survey
corridor, measures 58 m (northeast-southwest) × 24 m (northwest-southeast) (190 × 79 feet)
(Figure 5.2). The site itself has 100 percent ground visibility; however, vegetation surrounding
the site includes mesquite, creosotebush, and other low-lying grasses and forbs. The site is
estimated to be 75 percent intact; major sources of site disturbance include a previously placed
pipeline, use as a two-track road, and bioturbation. Based on the nature of the site, no subsurface
cultural deposits are likely.

Features
Feature 1 consists of the railroad grade, bed, and berms, which are constructed of a mixture of
red, black, and gray rocks. The railroad bed measures 9 to 10 feet wide with a short berm that
measures from 25 to 45 inches wide on both sides. This feature is currently being utilized as a
two-track road.

Material Identified
In total, 56 artifacts were documented. They are all associated with the construction and eventual
disassembling of the railroad. Descriptions of the artifacts can be found in Table 5.1.

Site Chronology
A historic Late Statehood (A.D. 1865–1900) was assigned to this site due to the history of the
construction of the Pecos Valley Railroad, located approximately 1.6 km (1 mile) east of the site.

Site Interpretation and Summary
Construction of the Pecos Valley Railroad was completed in 1891. This railroad ran from Pecos,
Texas, to Eddy, New Mexico. Due to its proximity and its intersection with the main grade to the
northeast, this site is likely a spur.

Eligibility Recommendations
Further research is needed to determine when this spur was built and if it was part of the Pecos
Valley Railroad. The integrity that remains with this site lies in its contribution to the history of
the railroad and settlement of the area around the Delaware River. Until further research can be
conducted to determine the importance of this spur to the construction of the Pecos Valley
Railroad and the development of the Delaware River area, this site has potential to be listed in
the NRHP under Criterion A. The eligibility is currently recommended as undetermined.

Management Recommendations
The proposed pipeline will be bored under the railroad grade, and no impact will occur to the
site. Therefore, no further management is recommended for this site related to this project.

Texas Isolated Manifestation Description
One brown chert Tularosa Corner Notched base with corner notching, random flaking pattern, and a
medial snap fracture. It also exhibits bifacial pressuring flaking on both lateral edges. The entire
fragment measures 2.7 × 2.6 × .5 cm, from tang to tang it measures 2.9 cm. The base measures 1 × 1.6
cm (Justice 2002:216–219, image-28.9).
One hole-in-top can. It is highly oxidized and crushed, so no measurements can be determined.
One gray orthoquartzite proximal flake fragment. It has a cortical platform and medial snap fracture, with
edge modification along one lateral side. There is <50% cortex present, size class 4–5.
One proximal flake fragment that has been taken from the non-ground, medial section of a brown
silicified ground stone artifact. The fragment measures 6.7 × 4.2 × 1.8 cm, is lacking cortex, and
possesses a plain platform. The ground side of the fragment is flat, well ground, with light striations. IM-4
may be a metate fragment.
One silicified sandstone edge modified complete flake. Bifacial pressure flaking on two lateral edges It
measures 6.5 × 4.6 × 1.3 cm and lacks any cortex.
One brown chert edge modified complete flake. Unifacial edge modification is present on one lateral
edge and the platform. The platform modification is indicative of a possible scrapper preform. The flake
possesses <50% cortex and measures 4.3 × 3.3 × 0.5 cm.
One tool is a silicified sandstone uniface, with parallel striations in one focused area, possibly caused by
plant, food, or material processing. The uniface measures 8.1 × 6 × 1.2 cm. One is a rectangular burnt
limestone cobble that has been parallel flaked on one lateral edge. The cobble measures 4.8 × 2.9 × 0.7
cm.
One brown quartzite flake with a plain platform and 0% cortex that has calcium carbonate buildup on its
dorsal side; size class 3–4. One white quartzite flake with one utilized lateral edge. The platform
appears crushed and it possesses <50% cortex; size class 3–4.
One silicified sandstone medial flake fragment with two snap fractures and calcium carbonate buildup on
80% of its dorsal surface; size class 9–10. One silicified sandstone flake with plain platform and <50%
cortex; size class 5–6.
One red translucent chalcedony flake with a cortical platform, >50 percent cortex; size class 3–4.
One white chalcedony medial flake fragment with two snap fractures, >50% cortex; size class 2–3.
One white translucent chalcedony projectile point measuring 3.1 × 2.6 × .5 cm in size, with a base that
measures 1.3 × 1.2 cm. It appears as though the base was once flat, but a small snap fracture is now
present on one corner, disfiguring the base’s original form. Random retouching flakes are also visible
surrounding one tang. This reworking caused the tangs to be asymmetrical. All other edges have flaking
present. The projectile point appears to be a reworked San Pedro or Tularosa Corner Notched point.
One gray chalcedony flake fragment, missing both lateral edges by means of snap fractures. It has a
cortical platform, <50% cortex, size class 3–4 cm.
One brown quartzite chopping/scraping tool with unifacially working on one lateral margin and four large
parallel flakes trending at a 40 degree angle on the obverse side. The worked edge has slight battering
present. The tool possesses 80% cortex and measures 8 × 7.5 × 4 cm.

6 SUMMARY OF ELIGIBILITY AND MANAGEMENT
RECOMMENDATIONS
SES selected SWCA to conduct an intensive pedestrian archaeological survey of the APE for the
proposed Residue Line to aid in complying with Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (16 United States Code 470) and its implementing regulations (36 CFR 800).
The work was performed to determine whether the proposed use of the area would affect
significant cultural resources. The archaeological investigation included an archaeological
background records review and an intensive pedestrian survey.
The background literature review determined that no previously recorded sites were located in the
project area and no previous surveys had been conducted in the project area. During the SWCA
field investigation, one new archaeological site and 13 isolated manifestations were encountered
within the Texas segment of the project area. Because the proposed pipeline will be bored under
the railroad grade making up site 41CU804, no impact will occur to the site. Therefore, no
further management is recommended for this site and SWCA recommends a finding of no
historic properties affected for the project. No further archaeological work is recommended for
the project area. However, if previously undocumented buried cultural resources are identified
during ground-disturbing activities, all work in the immediate vicinity of the discovery should
stop until the find can be evaluated by a professional archaeologist.
