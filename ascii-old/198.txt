ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of a proposed natural gas well site (2.81 acres) and clay
pond (3.67 acres) on the Eastham State Prison Farm Unit of the Texas Department of
Criminal Justice in southwest Houston County, Texas was performed by Brazos Valley
Research Associates (BVRA) on March 28, 2008 under antiquities permit 4870. The two
areas were investigated through a 100% Pedestrian Survey, shovel testing, and backhoe
trenching. The 5-1 well site is located on a slightly elevated area containing sandy soil 750
meters south of Negro Creek. No surface evidence of a prehistoric or historic site was
observed during the Pedestrian Survey; therefore, nine shovel tests and one backhoe
trench were excavated. The tests were dug through fine sandy loam, and no cultural
materials were observed. The proposed clay pond is located on a flat area less than 100
meters south of Negro Creek in heavy clay soil. One backhoe trench was excavated, and
no cultural materials were observed. No archaeological sites were found at either site, and
no artifacts were collected. In all, 6.48 acres were evaluated. Copies of this report are on
file at the Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division, the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory, and BVRA.

INTRODUCTION
Cordillera Texas LP of Longview, Texas plans to construct an oil and gas well
and a clay pond on property owned by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice in
southwest Houston County, Texas (Figure 1). The footprint of the well site is 2.81
acres (350 feet x 350 feet). Construction plans call for a well in the center of the pad
that will be constructed above ground. Except for the drill hole, the only subsurface
disturbance will be some minimal scraping at the apex of the landform to level the
site for construction of the pad. An existing access road will be used with no
subsurface modifications planned. This site is approximately 750 meters from the
nearest water source (Negro Creek) and is in the same general area as two well
pads that were investigated by BVRA earlier this year (Moore 2008). The clay pond
will be used as a containment area for soil removed from the A-1, 5-1, and 7-1 well
sites. The footprint of this pond will be 3.67 acres (400 feet x 400 feet), and It will be
excavated across the road from the A-1 well investigated by BVRA earlier this year
(Figure 2). The setting for the 5-1 well site was viewed by BVRA as a medium to
high probability area for the presence of a significant prehistoric site because of the
presence of sandy soil on an elevated landform adjacent to a tributary of Negro
Creek. It is the policy of the Eastham State Farm to evaluate all areas of proposed
construction for their potential for significant archaeological sites, and Cordillera
Texas LP retained BVRA to perform this service. The proposed 5-1 well and clay
pond site are depicted on the USGS 7.5â topographic quadrangles Baker Lake
(3095-343) and Sand Ridge (3195-212) (Figure 2). The original cellblock and prison
facility is still standing, and it is the subject of the photograph on the cover of this
report.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area is located within the West Gulf Coastal Plain section of the
Coastal Plain physiographic province as defined by Fenneman (1938:100-120).
Fenneman subdivides this province according to the age of the geological formations
(Gulf series) that roughly parallel the Texas coastline. The area is hilly and situated
within the East Texas timber belt. Gould (1969) describes it as an area characterized
by gently rolling to hilly topography with light colored soils that are acid sandy loams or
sands. The climate is subhumid to humid, and the weather is considered to be
predominately warm. Annual rainfall for Brazos County is 39.21 inches. A January
minimum temperature of 42 degrees Fahrenheit and a July maximum temperature of
95 degrees Fahrenheit combine to produce a growing season of 274 days (Kingston
and Harris 1983:180). The altitude varies from 200-400 feet.
The soil survey for Houston County was consulted prior to conducting the field
survey. According to this document (Steptoe 2002:Sheet 65), the 5-1 well site is
located within two soil types. They are Fuller fine sandy loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes
(FuA) and Hainesville fine sand, 0 to 2 percent slopes (HaA). FuA soils are found on
toeslopes and footslopes of uplands, while HaA soils are found on toeslopes of steam
terraces. FuA soils contain sandy and loamy soils to a depth of 36 inches where a clay
loam is encountered. At 44 inches, sandstone occurs. HaA soils contain fine sand to
70 inches where the sand is mixed with iron accumulations.
The proposed clay pond well site is located within soils defined by Steptoe
(2002:Sheet 65) as the Freestone-Derly complex, 0 to 2 percent slopes. These soils
are found on stream terraces and are nearly level to gently sloping. In a typical profile,
Freestone soils consist of sandy loam from the surface to a depth of 21 inches where
they change to a clay loam. In a typical profile, Derly soils consist of sandy loam from
the surface to a depth of 12 inches where it changes to clay loam. At 23 inches, gray
clay is present. The water table for the Freestone soils is perched at 2 feet to 3.5 feet
from December through May, and the water table for the Derly soils is perched at +. 5
foot to 1 footfrom October through May. Permeability in the Freestone soils is slow,
and it is very slow in the Derly soils. Figure 2 depicts the soils in the project area.
At the time of this survey the project area was devoid of all natural vegetation.
The ground cover along the pipeline consisted of pasture planted in Coastal Bermuda.
Figure 3 is a general view of the project area at the site of the 5-1 well site.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
According to a published planning document for the Eastern Planning Region of
Texas (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 1.1.2), Houston County is situated within
the Southeast Texas archeological study region. In 1985, according to a statistical
overview published by the Texas Historical Commission (Biesaart et al. 1985:114),
there were nine documented prehistoric sites in the county. The archaeological
potential of Houston County is reflected in part by the increasing number of recorded
sites found as a result of numerous cultural resource management studies. As a result
of these investigations, the number of recorded sites now stands at over 260 (TARL
site files). Small and large area surveys have been conducted in Houston County, and
the majority of these did not locate archaeological sites. According to the TARL site
records, 87 archaeological surveys and related projects have been carried out in
Houston County, and only 24 discuss archaeological sites or resulted in the
identification of previously unrecorded sites. Most of the areas investigated in the
county were associated with oil and gas projects (n=60), and the majority of these
studies were performed by James E. Corbin. Other projects include two field schools
sponsored by the University of Texas at Austin in 1977 and 1982, water distribution
lines, transmission lines, a fiber optic cable project, the proposed Bedias Reservoir, the
Tennessee Colony Reservoir, a city park, inventories and survey of the Davy Crocket
National Forest and Mission Tejas State Park. These studies date to the 1970s (n=5),
1980s (n=36), 1990s (n=39), and 2000s (n=3). Most of the early recorded sites were
documented by landowners and amateur archaeologists, and some of these are
potentially significant such as 41HO1 which was recorded by Edward B. Jelks in 1954
as a site containing glass beads, lead bullets, gun parts, arrow points, and sherds. A
second interesting site is 41HO6. It was documented by Alex D. Krieger in 1944 as a
location where a small cannon was uncovered in 1940 during plowing of a field by the
landowner.
Several investigations have been conducted in Southeast Texas that are
relevant to interpreting the archaeology of the project area. In fact, the project area is
in the center of a region that has been the recipient of several major reservoir
construction projects. Other, smaller projects have been conducted by private
archaeological contract firms, state agencies such as the Texas Department of
Transportation and the Texas Water Development Board, and amateur archaeologists.
Reservoirs in the area that have been examined by archaeologists include Addicks and
Barker (Wheat 1953), Lake Livingston (Nunley 1963), Wallisville (Shafer 1966; Ambler
1970), and Lake Creek (Boyd and Button 1985).
Works which have sought to synthesize prehistoric data relevant to the project
area include an early contribution by Sayles (1935) and the writings of Hole (1974),
Shafer (1975), Shafer and Stearns (1975), Shafer et al. (1975), Patterson (1979,
1983), Ambler (1973), Story (1981), Story et al. (1990), and Aten (1983). The latest
work, an expansion of Atenâs (1979) doctoral dissertation, is a particularly ambitious
and useful attempt to integrate ethno-historical, archaeological, and geo-morphological
data for the Upper Texas Coast.

The nearest recorded site to the current project area is 41HO83. This site was
recorded by archaeologists from Southern Methodist University in 1976 as a prehistoric
site on a high bluff overlooking the Trinity River to the north on the Eastham State
Prison Farm. The site form contains very little information, but it does state that the site
is on or very near the location that William M. Sorrow (1973) gives for the town of
Santisima Trinidad de Salcedo (1806-1813). Artifacts recovered include chips, flakes,
bone, burned clay, and a possible hearth that were exposed by a deep erosion cut.
The site was determined to be not significant, and no further work was recommended.
This research only found one other survey conducted on Eastham State Prison Farm
land. This study was carried out by Timothy K. Perttula (1997) in 1997, when he
surveyed two pastures and recorded sites 41HO183 â 41HO190. The eight sites
recorded consist of seven prehistoric campsites and one historic cemetery containing
two graves dating to 1843 and 1852. Six of the prehistoric campsites are located on
the first terrace above the Trinity River, and the seventh site is located on a pimple
mound. Three of the prehistoric campsites date to the Late Prehistoric period of Texas
prehistory based on the presence of ceramics and arrow points. Each of these sites is
described on the site form as having potential for being designated as a State
Archeological Landmark. No statement regarding their eligibility for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places appears on the site forms. Four of the prehistoric
campsites lacked diagnostic artifacts and could not be assigned to a temporal period.
These sites were considered to be not significant, and no further work was
recommended. All of the prehistoric campsites were found in sandy soils and were
examined through shovel testing and/or backhoe trenching. This investigation was
performed south of the current project area and is depicted on the 7.5â USGS Baker
Lake topographic quadrangle. Also on prison property is 41HO5. This site was
recorded by Dr. and Mrs. Sam Barnes in 1967 based on information provided by prison
guard Lee Runner. Arrow points and pottery were reportedly found in the area. At this
site, a flintlock rifle with flint in place was found in a plowed field.
The nearest investigation to the current project area was conducted by BVRA
at the location of two proposed well sites in the general area (Moore 2008). Well site
A-1 (located approximately 1200 meters to the northwest) and well site 7-1 (located
approximately 1500 meters to the south) were investigated by BVRA in February of
2008. These two areas were in clay soil, and a backhoe was used to examine the
subsurface. It was determined that the A-1 well site was a very unlikely location for
a prehistoric site because of the clay soils and distance to water (2400 meters). The
7-1 well site was much closer to the creek (150 meters), but it was also in a low area
containing clay soils. The only evidence of utilization of these areas was some
abandoned agricultural equipment at the A-1 well site and pasture that was being
used by cattle for grazing. In the past, the prison used the area for agricultural
purposes, mainly cotton.

METHODS OF INVESTIGATION
Pre-Field Tasks
Prior to entering the field, the site records at TARL and the Texas Archeological
Sites Atlas were checked for the presence of previously recorded archaeological sites
in the project area and vicinity. Relevant archaeological reports documenting work in
Houston County were reviewed in order to become familiar with the types of prehistoric
and historic sites found in the area.
Field Survey
The area was investigated under the supervision of the Principal Investigator
with assistance from James E. Warren, Colton Warren, and Art Romine on March 28,
2008. Originally, this project was designed to investigate the site of the proposed 5-1
well site. However, when we arrived in the project area we were told that the client
wanted us to investigate a proposed clay pond, which we did. The surface visibility at
the 5-1 well site was excellent, as grass cover was sparse and rodent disturbance was
extensive. The entire area was examined for displaced cultural materials, but no
artifacts were observed. The first step was the excavation of nine shovel tests
scattered across the 2.81-acre site. Shovel Test 1 was dug at the drill hole (Figure 5),
and the other tests were dug randomly within the areas determined to be the most
likely setting for a site (i.e., high ground). Excavated soil was screened using Â¼ inch
hardware cloth, and notes were taken that were used to create a shovel test log
(Appendix I). The tests were terminated at 60 cm without encountering clay. Profiles of
the shovel tests were drawn in the field. A backhoe trench was excavated near the drill
hole to ascertain the depth of clay. This trench was dug through sandy soil to 1.52 cm
before being terminated when ground water was reached. The trench was profiled in
the field (Appendix II). The approximate location of the nine shovel tests and backhoe
trench appear in Figure 6 below. The clay pond will be created in a flat area in clay soil.
Backhoe Trench 2 was excavated in the approximate center of this area. The trench
was four feet in length and dug through 60 cm of sandy clay and clay to a depth of 130
cm (Figure 7). This area is viewed as a very low probability area for a prehistoric site
because of the heavy clay. It should also be stated here that the A-1 well site was
excavated earlier this year just to the south of the proposed clay pit with negative
results (Figure 2). The project was documented through field notes and digital
photography.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Examination of the files at TARL in Austin, Texas and the Archeological Sites
Atlas revealed no sites have been recorded in the project area, and a professional
archaeologist had not previously examined the proposed well site or clay pond area.
The project area is located on land owned by the Eastham State Prison Farm that was
established in 1917. The photograph on the cover is the original cellblock and
administration building, but this study was not able to ascertain the exact date of its
construction. The prison land was used primarily for agricultural purposes, and the
major crops grown were cotton, corn, and milo. Prior to the acquisition of the property
by the Texas prison system, the project area was part of the Eastham Plantation (Mack
Currie personal communication). A search of the Internet and the Handbook of Texas
failed to reveal any information regarding this plantation except its cemetery is located
somewhere on prison property. A pedestrian survey and subsurface examination
through shovel testing revealed deep sand at the 5-1 well site, and a very shall sandy
mantle overlying heavy clay at the proposed clay pond. Although the 5-1 well will be
constructed on an elevated landform containing sandy soil, it is believed that the
reason for an absence of a prehistoric site is the distance to water (750 meters). A
small tributary of Negro Creek was observed adjacent to the creek, but it may not have
been a dependable source of water in prehistoric times. According to Mack Currie, the
discovery of artifacts on prison property is an event that is usually common knowledge,
and he has not heard of any such finds in the project area. He also mentioned that
there are several sandy hills north of the 5-1 well site that is in close proximity to the
creek. This may be a much higher probability area for a prehistoric site. The site of the
proposed clay pond is a very low probability for a prehistoric site because of the
presence of clay that predates human occupation close to the surface.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No archaeological sites were found as a result of this survey, which was
conducted in accordance with the Minimum Survey Standards as outlined by the Texas
Historical Commission, Archeology Division. It is recommended that the client be
allowed to proceed with construction of the well pad and clay pond as planned. Should
evidence of an archaeological site be encountered, all work must stop until the Texas
Historical Commission (THC) can evaluate the situation. In the event the footprint of
the project area of the well pad or clay pond changes, the THC must be notified, as
additional survey may be necessary.
