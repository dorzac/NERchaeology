Teddy Lou Stickney
To Present Program
May 24, 2007
Teddy Lou Stickney, a well known avocational archeologist throughout Texas will be
giving our May program on Cowboy rock art.
Teddy Lou discovered, while recording
prehistoric rock art in the Panhandle of Texas,
that some of the symbols the TAS Rock Art
group had recorded were in fact old cattle
brands from long ago.
After a great deal of investigation she
learned the names of the ranches where these
brands came from. Along with the brands
were initials and dates which made the boulders these were carved on very valuable
sources of information about the men who
worked on these ranches and when they did.
Some ranches kept very good records of employees, and others never bothered.

CVAS Big Bend Trip
Nineteen members of the CVAS made
the trip to Big Bend on April 13th thru the
15th, and enjoyed perfect weather.
On Saturday, two hikes were made,
one to Chimney Rock, where hundreds of
pictographs were observed. After lunch, the
group made a return trip to Indian Wells
near Study Butte. The members were able to
locate many more petroglyphs and mortar
holes that a Park Ranger pointed out on a
previous trip by climbing up into the boulders, some of which were the size of a
house.

2007 TAS Field School at Menard
Jack Pool, Camp Director

I would like to encourage CVAS members to attend the TAS Field School which
will return to the old Spanish Presidio in
Menard June 9th - 16th. Since we will be in
the Region 10 area, we are the unofficial host
society. It would be nice to have a good
showing for this year’s event. This will be
the third field school at the Presidio San Luis
de Las Amarillas on the beautiful banks of the
San Saba River at Menard. Camping and
other accommodations are available on-site or
nearby. Even if you can only make it down
for a day or two it will certainly be worthwhile.
Each day excavations and field surveys
will be conducted from 7:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.
Afterward, the friendly folks at Menard have
scheduled interesting field trips, entertainment, and other activities. They will be celebrating the 250th Anniversary of the establishment of the Mission and Presidio that week.
All activities are centered at the The
Stockpens Crossings Park and Pavilion. Tent
camping east of the pavilion is free with cold
showers and port-o-potties provided. The RV
park next door has only a few tent spaces (for
fee) available. The Baptist Encampment next
door may have a couple of RV sites available
at a rate of $15.00 a night.
The Baptist Encampment will also have
air conditioned dormitories for men and
women. Each dorm will sleep up to 120 people. The cost to stay in a dorm is $7.00 a
night and includes full bathroom facilities
with hot showers. They will also offer hot
showers to TAS members not staying with
them for $2.50.
I will be getting showers built and everything set up Friday morning, June 8th, and I
would appreciate any assistance you could
provide.

If you can help, please contact me.
You are required to be a member of the
Texas Archeological Society to attend the
field school. Please submit your registration form no later than May 31st. You can
join TAS and complete the registration
form on line at http://www.txarch.org or
contact me or any other TAS member for
an application.

very remote site.

Rock Art Foundation Tour
Meyers Springs - May 26 th

Please include the number in your group
and a telephone number where we might
reach you the morning of the tour. Please no
pets.

Meyers Springs, a major source of
water in dry west Texas, has been a center
for human activity for thousands of years.
At the spring site ancient peoples left Pecos River style rock art. Then later native
artists recorded the European contact with
the indigenous peoples atop the older
paintings. Still later the Buffalo Soldiers
and local ranchers left their marks. This
site was added to the National Register of
Historic Places in 1972 and today is privately owned. The Rock Art Foundation in
cooperation with the landowner invites
you for a tour to this very important rock
art and historic site.
Your guide for this tour will be Greg
Williams. The tour will meet in Dryden,
Texas, at the intersection of Hwy 90 and
Hwy 349. Be there at 9:30am and be prepared for a prompt 10:00am departure. Be
sure to bring everything you need for a
day in the west Texas sun - water, lunch,
and sunscreen.
The drive to the ranch does not require any special vehicle and all except for
the lowest of cars will do fine. Once there
it is a short walk to the rock art panel. This
tour is suitable for young children. After
seeing the rock art the tour will drive a
short distant to Fort Meyers, an outpost of
the Seminole Negro Indian Scouts who patrolled the western Texas frontier in the
1880’s and 90’s. The tour usually concludes by 3:00pm. The cost of this tour is
$35.00 per person. To register for the tour
email the RAF at rockart01@aol.com or
call 888-762-5278.

Rock Art Foundation Tour
Cedar Springs and Mystic
Shelter June 2, 2007
Come join the RAF for a tour to Cedar
Springs and Mystic Shelter along the cool and
inviting Devils River - considered the cleanest
river in Texas. This early summer tour is as
popular for the swimming in the Devils as for
the rock art. This will be the last RAF tour
until the fall tour season.
This tour does require that participants
have their own high clearance four-wheel
drive vehicle. The rough and steep terrain
along the river requires 4wd. Two-wheel drive
vehicles run the risk of getting stuck or disabled on this road. If you have questions
about the suitability of your vehicle please
email us.
You will visit two highly painted Pecos
River style sites on this tour. The first, Cedar
Springs, is an easy walk from the parking
area. The second, Mystic Shelter, is just over
a mile away. Getting there requires a steep descent over rough loose rocks to the level of
the river. Once down by the river the hike is
then over relatively level, but unprotected
rock terraces along the river then into a rough
rocky canyon for a short distance. This can be
a very HOT trip, but swimming is nearby. All
participants must be able to negotiate the
rough terrain and hike in the heat. This tour
requires stamina, agility and balance. You will
be in a remote location where response to serious injuries and medical emergencies will
be difficult and lengthy. Please be prepared
for this hike and the heat.
The tour will at 9:00AM in the parking
lot of the Chevron station just west of Del
Rio at the intersection of Hwy 90 and
continued next column
Page 5

Hwy 277/377 – known locally as the “Y”.
Be prepared for a prompt 9:30 AM departure. There are no conveniences after this.
Bring food, water and have your vehicles
gassed up.
Remember to check your spare tire
for inflation. Please no pets. The cost of
this tour is $35.00 and is payable to the
guide the morning of the tour. Register by
email to rockart01@aol.com. Please include the number in your group and if possible a telephone number where we might
reach you the evening prior or morning of
the tour. If you should need to cancel,
please let us know.

Thanks to all the CVAS members
who volunteered their time during the
Fort Chadbourne Days. The event was a
big success. On Friday, over 1000 students from area schools visited the event.
Over the two days many people were exposed to history and archeology. That’s
what the CVAS is all about. Thanks again,
Larry Riemenschneider
