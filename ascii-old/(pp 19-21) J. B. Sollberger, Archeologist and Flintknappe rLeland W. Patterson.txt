J. B. Sollberger, Archeologist and Flintknapper
Leland W. Patterson
The work of J. B. Sollberger, known to his many friends and associates
simple as "Solly," has been familiar for many years to people engaged in
archeology in Texas. His career as an avocational archeologist spans several
decades. Solly is known for work in Texas prehistoric archeology and for
research in experimental flintknapping. His work has been published in several
journals, including American Antiquity, Plains Anthropologist, Lithic Technology, La Tierra (Journal of the Southern Texas Archaeological Association), The
Record (publication of the Dallas Archeological Society), and the Bulletin of the
Texas Archeological Society.
Sony was born in 1914 in Dallas, Texas, where he graduated from high
school in 1932. He became a plumber in Big Spring, Texas and, in 1935, married
Anna Stohacker, of Kerrville, Texas. In the 1930s he explored several sites in
South Central Texas, and his earlier archeological publications focus on this
region. During World War II, from 1942 to 1945, he served in the Army Air
Corps. Subsequently, he has been a long-time resident of Dallas, as his backyard lithic workshop attests. He retired in 1977 after having been involved in the
construction of steam-generated electric power plants, primarily in the Dallas
region. Solly has been a long-time member of the Texas Archeological Society,
the Dallas Archeological Society, and is a founding member of the Southern
Texas Archaeological Association.
One thing that most distinguishes Sollberger is his ability to share his
expertise with others. He has taught several generations of Texas flintknappers
and has given many lectures and demonstrations on lithic technology. He also
has been author or coauthor of more than 50 publications and has provided
technical advice on lithic technology for projects of other individuals.
Solly has been engaged in archeological activities in South Central Texas
since 1934. He has surveyed and studied the prehistory of this region and has
shared his ideas in both published and verbal form. Typical of his publications
are site reports (Sollberger 1948, 1949, 1950), naming of the Edwards arrowpoint type, initial postulation of the Turtle Creek phase of South Central Texas
(Sollberger 1967; see also La Tierra, Volume 4, No. 4, October 1978), and
thoughts on the Late Paleo-Indian/Early Archaic transition in South Central
Texas (Sollberger and Hester 1972).
Some of his other publications on the archeology of Texas are a study of an
animal effigy (Sollberger 1978), comments on the possible functions of Guadalupe tools (Sollberger and Carroll 1985), and general reflections on the science
of archeology (Sollberger 1982, 1987).
Sollberger is well known and respected for his general archeological

activities, but he has also earned fame as an experimental flintknapper. He is
recognized as a Master Knapper in both North America and Europe and was
recently honored as a recipient of the annual Don Crabtree Award of the Society
for American Archaeology. Solly once said he got started in flintknapping after
watching someone make a simple unifacial scraper, and once he had the "bug,"
there was no stopping his drive to become one of the best flintknappers of
this era.
One of Solly’s strong points is that he is a very astute observer of fracture
patterns in knapped material. This has allowed him not only to perfect his
knapping techniques, but also to make contributions to fracture theory (Sollberger 1986). He is also an innovator of knapping techniques, seen in his
development of unique pressure methods for controlling the fluting of Folsom
point replicates (Sollberger 1985: Figure 1; Sollberger and Patterson 1980:
Figures 2 and 3; Sollberger, elsewhere in this volume).
Solly constantly works to improve his flintknapping techniques. I once gave
him a cast of a Lindenmeier site Folsom point with a thickness of 3.1 mm. At the
time, Solly’s Folsom replicates averaged about 3.9 mm in thickness. The extreme thinness of the Lindenmeier site point became Solly’s new goal, and
shortly afterwards the average thickness of his Folsom replicates was no more
than about 3.2 mm.
Sollberger has taught many individuals the science and art of flintknapping
and has given many demonstrations of his knapping skill to university groups,
regional and local archeological groups, and the public. He is one of the founders of the Texas Knap-Ins, which serves as a focal point for experimental
flintknappers in this state. Solly is never too busy to give advice to someone who
wants to learn more about flintknapping. He has served as a reviewer for the
journal Lithic Technology and has done replicate experiments in flintknapping
for several professional archeologists, one of which involved replicating methods of Maya tranchet tool production (Shafer 1983:60).
Sollberger’s publications on flintknapping cover subjects such as prismatic
blade manufacture (Sollberger and Patterson 1976), thermal alteration of siliceous stone (Sollberger and Hester 1973), and lithic tool kits (Sollberger 1969).
His report on the technology of Plains Indian beveled knives (sometimes called
Harahey knives) is a classic reference (Sollberger 1971).
J. B. Sollberger is well known for his contributions to Texas archeology and
to lithic technology. Even more, however, he is known to his many associates as
a good friend and advisor. His work typifies what the best serious avocational
archeologists are contributing to the science of archeology.
