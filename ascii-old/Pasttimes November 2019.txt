PANHANDLE ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY
Minutes of September 18, 2019
The meeting was called to order by Veronica Arias at 7:12 p.m. in the Amarillo Downtown Library.
There were 21 persons in attendance.
PROGRAM: Speaker for the evening was Doug Wilkens, TAS Region 1 Director and THC Archeological
Steward since 1982. Doug’s topic was: “Reverse Engineering Drover’s House as Defined in Burned Dirt,
Burned Daub, and Charred Posts.” Drover’s House is part of the “Whistling Squaw” site in Roberts County,
41RB108 - Feature 3. Dating results on portions of this structure are: 810 +/- 40 YPB, or AD 1170-1280.
The heat from this house burning was an essential part of the archeological preservation. In particular, heat from
the fire hardened the daub and soil on the roof, enhancing its preservation. Excavation work revealed a thatch
layer on top of the daub, then a soil layer of as much as 25-30 cm above the thatch. There were various heat affected zones in the soil layer. The house was plastered inside – on the ceiling, the walls, and the floor. Some of
the ceiling plaster was decorated in a manner similar to the local pottery. The central support posts in the structure were inverted, with the larger end of the logs at the top, and smaller ends at the bottom. The fire-hardened
plaster and daub preserved many detailed impressions of wooden structural features, allowing for detailed analysis of the architecture.
MINUTES: Scott Brosowske moved that the Minutes of the May meeting be approved as published in the
PASTIMES Newsletter. This was seconded by Rolla Shaller and the Minutes were accepted.
TREASURER’S REPORT: Treasurer Pam Allison reported an account balance of $2,492.43.
PUBLICATIONS REPORT: Rolla Shaller reported ending August, 2019 balances of $2,379.99 in the Money
Market Account, and $5,239.20 in the Certificate of Deposit.
OLD BUSINESS:
No items of Old Business were raised.
NEW BUSINESS:
In preparation for our Annual Studer Banquet, a reservation has been made at Youngblood’s Restaurant for the
evening of December 14, 2019. Of those attending tonight’s meeting, approximately 20 persons indicated that
they planned to attend the Studer Banquet. Members were reminded to bring donation items for the Silent Auction at the Banquet.
An idea was mentioned to cancel the October PAS Meeting due to all the upcoming activity involved with the
TAS Annual Meeting (Oct. 11-13). Rolla Shaller moved that the October PAS Meeting be cancelled, and this
was seconded by Joe Rogers. The attending PAS members approved with a unanimous verbal vote, so the October Meeting was cancelled.
A Nominations Committee was formed for the upcoming election of 2020 PAS Officers. Rolla Shaller will chair
the committee, and Pam Allison will be a committee member.
Scott Brosowske announced that the BLM needs volunteers on September 28 for a scheduled day of Field Work
at the Cross Bar Ranch. Interested Members can contact Scott for further information.
Scott provided an update of TAS Annual Meeting preparations, and mentioned volunteer opportunities for PAS
Members.
A draft schedule of the TAS Paper Sessions was shown. Three simultaneous sessions are planned.
Speaker for the TAS Banquet will be Dr. Doug Scott, talking on Military and Indian sites in the Guadalupe
Mountains.
A student group from WTAMU will volunteer to help work the Registration desk.
PAS Members are invited to help with Registration Badge & Banquet ticket setup on Thursday evening, Oct. 10.
Members are also invited to help with setup of the Silent Auction on Friday Morning, Oct. 11.
Volunteers are needed to deliver drinks and box lunches for the Bus Tours on Friday & Sunday.
Members are invited to help as runners/troubleshooters in the conference area for any issues that might arise.
The meeting adjourned at 8:50 p.m.
Respectfully submitted,
Andy Burcham, Secretary

Update on the Cross Bar Management Area
Jamie Palmer, BLM Oklahoma Field Office

Abstract
The Cross Bar Management Area (CBMA) encompasses approximately 12,000 acres in
Potter County, TX and is managed by the Bureau of Land Management-Oklahoma Field
Office (BLM-OFO). To date, there has not been a compilation of the earlier cultural resource work or the prehistoric and historical activity on the CBMA. In this talk, we will
discuss what has already been done, what the future holds for the CBMA, as well as possible roles the Panhandle Archaeological Society can fill.
