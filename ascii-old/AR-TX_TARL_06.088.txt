ABSTRACT
During January and February, 1982, the Texas Archeological
Survey, The University of Texas at Austin, conducted a program of
cultural resource survey and assessment along two narrow
land
corridors in Rusk County, Texas, which would be modified by the
construction of a mining supported railway and an electrical power
transmission line.
The program was sponsored by Texas Utilities
Services, Inc., of Dallas, Texas and was designed to locate, inventory
and assess the cultural resources within the corridors• proposed
rights-of-way. The full results of the program are published in Texas
Archeological Survey Technical Bulletin No. 57, The University of
Texas at Austin. Among the results was the finding of a modified log
structure, dating to 1841, in a location where it would be adversely
affected by the construction of the proposed railway.
Subsequent
research and documentation has resulted in this log structure, the
Walling Cabin, being eligible for inclusion on the National Register
of Historic Places. The cabin's significance lies in its being a fine
example of pioneer vernacular architecture and in its association with
an important early settler, Thomas J. Walling, its first owner and
builder of the basic structure. Negotiations with the sponsor and
appropriate national, state and county authorities culminated in the
relocation of the cabin to nearby Henderson, Texas for reconstruction
and restoration and in the concurrent investigation and mitigation
program described herein.

INTRODUCTION

PROGRAM OUTLINE
A four phase, Mitigation of Impact Program for the Walling Cabin,
41RK104, was conducted for Texas Utilities Services, Inc. (TUSI) by
the Texas Archeological Survey (TAS), The University of Texas at
Austin, during August and September, 1982, under the terms of Purchase
Order MLD-009. The program was designed and conducted to conform with
the criteria and guidelines set forth by the Texas Historical
Commission for mitigation-of-impact programs.
Research was carried
out in compliance with the implementing regulations, 36CFR800, of the
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966. The general objectives of
the program were to minimize the impact of the proposed railway
construction on the Walling Cabin site by continuing the research
program ini~iated during the foregoing intensive survey (Moncure and
Jackson 1982), recording the current site context, and effecting the
recovery, analysis and documentation of cultural materials from the
cabin. This was the archeological aspect of a joint TUSI, TAS, Rusk
County Historical Commission overall program aimed at researching,
relocating and restoring the cabin.
On-site operations were accomplished in four phases. Phase 1 was
the production of Historic American Buildings Survey drawings (HABS)
by TUSI. Phase 2 was devoted to archeological investigation of the
site and included mapping, recording, photographing, a metal detector
survey-surface artifact collection comparison, and the refinement of
the
HASS
drawings
by TAS.
Phase 3 was the TAS subsurface
archeological investigation of five features associated with the
cabin, utilizing earth-moving equipment furnished by TUSI. During
Phase 4, (TAS, TUSI, Rusk County Historical Commission), the cabin,
the original single pen, was carefully recorded and marked part by
part. The cabin was then dismantled, and all parts which were
structurally sound or restorable were moved to the reconstruction site
in Henderson.
Non-original, later additions with potential for
replacing badly deteriorated original pen parts were also removed to
that site for possible use in restoral. Phase 5, the final on-site
phase, was the TAS subsurface investigation of the area which had lain
underneath the original single pen cabin.
LOCATION DATA AND IMPACT POTENTIAL FACTORS
Rusk County is located in the northeastern part of Texas between
north latitudes 31 degrees 51 minutes_ and 32 degrees 25 minutes, and
west longitudes 94 degrees 25 minutes and 94 degrees 59 minutes.

WALLING CABIN

The geographic location of the Walling Cabin within the county
(Figure 1) was three-quarters of a mile east of State Highway 43 just
off an unmarked, county-maintained dirt road.
The county road
intersects State Highway 43 2.5 miles northeast of Antioch Community.
The closest larger community is the Rusk County seat, Henderson, with
city limits approximately 6 miles southeast on Highway 43. The
location of the proposed railway right-of-way relative to State
Highway 43 and its path through the T.J. Walling survey is shown in
Figure 2.
The location of the cabin within the T.J. Walling survey and the
passage of the proposed right-of-way through the southeast corner of
the cabin is shown in Figure 3. A sketch map of the site as it
appeared when first recorded comprises Figure 4 and includes the
general location of features associated with the cabin. The proposed
right-of-way, at the cabin location, is 431.69 feet wide with the
cabin situated, as shown in Figure 3, so that the railway roadbed
centerline passes through it. To further compound potential impact to
the site a shallow grade road overpass is to be constructed to allow
the railroad to cross the county road immediately south of the cabin.
Oil company pipelines parallel the right-of-way very near each border
and are obstacles to engineering the displacement of the railway
sufficiently to avoid the site. Mitigation in the form of recording,
excavation, removal and restoration was the most viable solution.

ENVIRONMENTAL DATA
GEOMORPHOLOGY
Rusk County is within Fenneman's (1938a:100-103) West Gulf
Coastal Plain physiographic province, which is characterized by gently
rolling hills and ridges which rarely exceed 500 feet Above Mean Sea
Level (AMSL).
Set on a low east/west ridge between two small stream
valleys, those of Wright Branch and Wasson Branch, elevation at the
cabin site rarely exceeds 400 feet AMSL. Sand, silt and mud deposits
have undergone differential erosion to produce the hills and valleys.
The presence of the sand element can be readily observed in the soil.
The designation West Gulf Coastal Plain is, for this area, usually
further defined to identify the area as the East Texas Timber Belt,
based on the dominant vegetation, and/or the Nacogdoches Cuesta
(Fenneman 1938b), based on the dominant landform, Both designations
are included here since the
vegetation
is
linked
to
soil
characteristics, faunal array and land use, while the rock base
relates to soil parentages, geological formations and, in turn, to the
processes which caused and act upon them.
GEOLOGY
Rusk County is within the Gulf Coastal Tertiary Province (Henry
and
Basciano
1979:4).
The Sabine Uplift dominates the area
structurally and coincides in boundary with the transition zone
between
the
ancient alluvial and deltaic plains.
This .broad
structural uplift produces a gentle northwest dip (0.2 degrees) of the
area's geologic units (Kaiser, Ayers and LaBrie 1980:24).
The
dominant unit is the Wilcox Group, which is composed principally of
sand and mud deposited by ancient river systems (Kaiser, Johnston and
Bach 1978:19). Partially overlying the Wilcox Group is the Claiborne
Group, a rhythmic series of marine and continental sand and clay
deposits where a marine fossiliferous formation alternates with a
sandy non-marine formation (Sellards, Adkins and Plummer 1932:610). A
thin veneer of modern deposits, mostly sand, gravel and clay occurs in
the modern stream valleys such as those of Wright and Wasson branches.
This veneer, in the cabin locale, is present for most, if not all, of
the area between the two streams. The texture of these top level
deposits becomes progressively more coarse with depth.
The high sand content of the Wilcox Group, which reaches 60
percent in the area (Kaiser, Johnston and Bach 1978:19), shapes much

formed from it, coupled with the modern stream valley veneer described
above, produces a fragile, easily disrupted, environment for cultural

resources.
The
greater
than
average
hydraulic
drainage
characteristics of these deposits produce rapid surface
drying
following a rain and a tendency toward leaching of higher ground
soils, such as those in the immediate cabin site area.
SOILS
The Soil Conservation Service, United States Department of
Agriculture, is currently engaged in mapping the Rusk County area.
The mapping, still undergoing refinement, shows the Walling Cabin site
sofls
to
be of the
Kirvin-Bowie-Cuthbert Association (Soil
Conservation Service Aerial Photos, CGD-ZAA-194, CGD-18-34, and CGD10-13 with annotations). The most recent general soil map (SCS 1974)
of the area describes the Kirvin-Bowie-Cuthbert Association as gently
sloping, moderately permeable soils.
The association consists of
about 35 percent Kirvin, 30 percent Bowie, 20 percent Cuthbert and 15
percent other soils.
Kirvin soils typically have a thin fine sandy
loam surface layer over a red clay subsoil and occur as gently sloping
broad convex interstream divides (SCS 1974). This description matches
field observations by the TAS crew made during the several excavations
at the cabin site.
Cross-referencing Soil Conservation Service records, field notes
and observations produced a detailed soil characterization as follows.
These are deep loamy upland soils which are nearly level to gently
sloping.
They absorb water moderately to moderately rapidly and are
well drained. The water holding capacity is medium to high.
The
plant-soil-moisture relationship is good. The production potential is
medium to high for grasses such as improved bermuda grass, weeping
love grass and bahia grass (SCS 1969, 1974, ms). In a representative
profile, the surface layer is a brownish fine sandy loam about 11
inches thick.
The subsoil, from 11 to 80 inches, is a yellowish red
fine sandy loam. From 80 to 96 inches the subsoil is a strong brown
fine sandy loam distinctly mottled with yellowish brown (SCS ms, ms).
This description meshes well with the observations and records of the
TAS crew obtained during the trenching of the root cellar feature.
See Figure 34 and its accompanying description.
Cotton production
from these soils, those within the study area and adjacent to it, at
one time exceeded that of any other locale in the Henderson area
(P. Young 1982).
HYDROLOGY
The area's major aquifer is composed of the Wilcox Group and the
overlying Carrizo sand of the Claiborne Group. The Carrizo-Wilcox
strata is considered a single aquifer (Henry and Basciano 1979:4).
The aquifer consists, in the main, of hydrologically connected
ferruginous, cross-bedded sand with clay, sandstone, silt, lignite,
and gravel. It is recharged by precipitation and by streams crossing
the outcrop area (Muller and Price 1979:17). Within the study area
the aquifer is saturated to a depth near the land surface which causes

8

WALLING CABIN

much potential recharge to be rejected and turned into stream runoff.
Well depth in the area need not be very great but it must reach into
the aquifer a sufficient depth to insure that seeps, springs, and the
two nearby stream branches do not draw off most of the water. The two
wells associated with the cabin were comparatively shallow.
The one
located furthest downslope was the shallowest and was described by a
former user as "not much of a well" (P. Young 1982). The upper well,
closest to the cabin and further upslope, was somewhat deeper but was
dry when the mitigation program began.
Mr. Preston Young, cabin
resident from 1923 to 1926, has indicated that most of the water used
came from a spring located downslope and outside the railroad
right-of-way.
STREAM ORDER AND DRAINAGE
Ordering of streams is based on the premise that the first order
streams of a drainage basin are the smallest gullies or channels
having well-defined banks. Most such streams are intermittent and are
right at the limits of resolution on U.S. Geological Survey 1:24,000
scale maps (Butzer 1976:185).
Ordering then follows a hierarchy
developed by the joining of two first order streams to form a second
order stream, two second order streams to form a third order, and so
on.
The areal division supplied by stream ordering assists in
highlighting areas of high archeological potential and forms a
natural, permanent, reference grid useful for future study.
The Walling Cabin area lies within the Sabine River Basin.
The
present bed of that river is approximately 25 km northeast of the
cabin at its closest approach.
Drainage to. the river is via an
unremarkable dendritic pattern. Short intermittent channels feed into
Wright and Wasson branches, the second order streams.
Wasson Branch
flows in a southeast direction past the site at a distance of 0.5 km
to the northeast and curves northward until it flows nearly due east.
Wright Branch, which passes the site 1.2 km to the south, flowing
east, curves northward until it converges with Wasson Branch at a
point 3.1 km east of the site. The combined creeks, now a third order
stream, retain the Wasson name and the flow continues east to Martin
Lake. Martin Creek is one of several feeding into Martin Lake and the
Martin name is retained in designating the stream outlet from the
lake.
This stream, th~ fourth order waterway in the system, flows
north-northeast to the Sabine River, the fifth order stream.
The
Sabine turns south in neighboring Panola County and just below that
county, forms the eastern border of Texas all the way to Sabine Lake
at Port Arthur where it empties into the Gulf of Mexico via Sabine
Pass. Stream flow from the cabin area to the Sabine River is
approximately 38.5 km.
The changes in direction of the stream pattern are due to the
Sabine Uplift, the dominant structural control in the area. With the
exception of man-made Martin Lake, the stream density, pattern and
gradients encountered in this stream order show no archeologically
significant deviation from the classic, textbook versions of those

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

characteristics.
CLIMATE
Rusk County lies within Carr's (1967:17) East Texas climatic
division.
Maximum precipitation occurs twice annually, in May and
December, with the minimum occurring in August. The average rainfall
is between 44 and 48 inches and its pattern results in a high winter
surplus small summer deficit of available water but an annual
aggregate surplus sufficient to maintain a humid condition (Arbingast
and others 1973:19, Russell 1945:46). Neither well associated with
the cabin contained any water, the spring which was mentioned by a
former resident was not flowing (P. Young 1982), and Wasson Branch was
barely flowing.
Mean annual evaporation (1940-1957), for the county
is 10 inches, a factor contributing significantly to this summer water
deficit (Kier, Garner and Grown 1977:map). A mean annual temperature
of 66.4 degrees F has been recorded (1940-1978) and the seasonal
pattern provides a mean annual growing season, the average interval
between killing frosts, just above 250 days, a mild climate (Vines
1977:xvii map).
VEGETATION
The study area is located in Gould's (1975:2) Texas Vegetational
Region 1, the Pineywoods. The area, also known as the Timber Belt and
the East Texas Forest Region, is the southwestern extremity of the
pine/hardwood forests of the southeastern United States.
Plant
distribution is most directly linked to two above-mentioned factors;
soil and climate, and to land uses since initial settlement.
The cabin area is flanked by areas which once were under
cultivation but are now improved pasture. Bermuda grass and bahia
grass dominate with an overlay of switch grass, red love grass and
vasey grass. In the area to the cabin's front (south) a relict garden
with iris and marigolds is in evidence. This area also harbored a
large Bois d'Arc (Osage Orange) tree, and several oaks as well as
shrubs such as dogwood, hawthorn, sumac and sparkleberry.
A large
loblolly pine is situated at the fence paralleling the road. To the
rear of the cabin and downslope (north) toward Wasson Branch is a
forested area with large oaks, several types of pine, virgin and
second growth, a profusion of vines and small shrubs, and several
domestic tree species, notably figs and Bois d'Arc. The presence
today of these large, straight-trunked pines and oaks indicates the
cabin's structural material was probably readily available close to
the construction site. It seems doubtful such huge specimens would
have been allowed to escape use if others of sufficient size hadn't
been close at hand. Though the Bois d'Arc trees are within their
native range (Winberry 1979:135) their presence on current and former
fencelines indicates deliberate planting. Bois d'Arc found extensive
use as a living fence, a source of fence posts and a source of yellow
dye from the 1840s until World War I (USDA 1872:501-505, Platt

FAUNA
The study area is located within the Austroriparian biotic
province, which includes the Gulf Coastal Plain from the Atlantic to
eastern Texas (Blair 1950:99).
The vertebrate
fauna
of
the
Austroriparian of Texas cited below is typical of the province as a
whole. Blair cites 47 mammalian species either present or recently
occurring, plus 29 snake species, 10 lizards, two land turtles, and 35
frog, toad and salmander species. Representative small mammals are
the oppossum, mole, eastern fox squirrel, eastern gray squirrel,
plains pocket gopher, eastern cottontail rabbit and raccoon (Burt and
Grossenheider
1976).
Carnivore species include the omnipresent
coyote, longtail weasel, both spotted and striped skunks, red and gray
foxes, and bobcat. The area is within the range of the now rare red
wolf (Burt and Grossenheider 1976:71). Whitetail deer are present in
the area and are today the only large-bodied mammal found in quantity.
Archeological excavations within the province and historical
records show that the area's current faunal array is not inclusive of
a number of important species available to hunters of the prehistoric
or early historic human population of the area.
Archeological
investigation has produced the bones of bison, puma, black bear and
lynx, all now missing from the province (House 1978:110-125). Thomas
Jefferson Walling, first occupant of the cabin, is quoted in a 1875
letter, as citing among his past blessings as a Texas pioneer, the
hunting of buffalo, bear and wild turkey (Robertson 1875).
LAND USE
Agriculture is, and has been, the study area 1 s dominant land use.
The land surrounding the cabin is now a pasture and has, at various
times during this century, been used to grow cotton, corn and
watermelons according to informants (P. Young 1982; Green 1982). The
informants• personal knowledge extends back to the early 1920s.
General descriptions of agricultural practi~es in the immediate area
further extend the same sort of farming practice and crop selection
back to the 1870s (Ely and Kocher 1907:8-9). The contents of the
estate of John Harrison, second owner of the cabin, filed with the
Rusk County court authorities in 1863, shows 11 one lot farming tools 11 ,
and includes among its entries seed cotton, corn, a quantity of pork,
twelve pork hogs, 33 stock hogs and twelve head of cattle (file 793,
Probate Records, Rusk County 1863).
From these records it would
follow that farming, in terms of products, has held nearly constant
through most of the time since the construction of the cabin. Changes
appear to be those associated with cultivation tools, motive power for
these tools, the introduction
of commercial
fertilizers
and
pesticides, and the use of_ cattle fodder supplements. Harrison 1 s
estate included slaves and a yoke of oxen. Twentieth century farming

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

11

by tractor and hired hand was a subject of an informant interview
(Morris 1982).
Cattle feed supplements,
crop
pesticides
and
commercial fertilizers were found stored within the cabin by the TAS
crew, while the introduction of fertilizers is included in Ely and
Kocher (1907) and "one lot (of) fodder" forms part of the Harri son
estate (file 793, Probate Records, Rusk County 1863).
An examination of the Federal census records for 1850 and 1860
shows that operation of the average Rusk County farm was conducted by
the owner with assistance from members of the family. Also common was
owner operation with assistance from other persons listed as living in
the household (Dunn 1981, 1982). The use of slaves began with initial
settlement of the area and continued through the War Between the
States but most slaveowners did not have large numbers of slaves. The
probate records of the property of John Harrison, second owner of the
cabin, include several references to his slaves, one adult man and two
young children (Rusk County Probate file 729).
At the time of
Harrison's death in 1859 the two children, both boys, were aged 6 and
2 so, for most farming purposes, Harrison effectively had a slave work
force of one operating on a farm of 307 acres. After the war and the
abolishment of slavery, tenant farming gained favor until in 1907 Ely
and Kocher could state ''the average-sized farm (in the Henderson area)
is about 75 acres" and, "slightly less than one-half of the farms are
operated by the owners" (Ely and Kocher 1907:6-9).
These gentlemen,
whose knowledge stems from a soil survey of the county, further remark
that only half of the 75 acre average is cultivated land, 11 or about
what can be cultivated with one mule" (Ely and Kocher 1907:9).
By 1920 farm size in Rusk County was just over 80 acres and
owners operated 3,008 farms, tenants 2,984 and managers ran the
remaining seven (Fourteenth Census 1920:664).
In contrast
the
Henderson Chamber of Commerce in 1929 (just prior to the Depression
years), set the number of farms at approximately 4,000 with nearly
3,000 worked by their owners (Winfrey 1951:139). Mechanization had
made the consolidation of small farms possible and allowed owners to
work property formerly leased to tenants. The study area was farmed
in a pattern in synch with the county as a whole.
Thomas Jefferson
Walling and his family began the operational sequence. A pair of
newlyweds unrelated to the Wallings had joined the work force by 1850
(Dunn 1981:95).
Walling sold out to Harrison in 1859. During the
period of the Civil War and until Harrison's widow could settle his
estate, the property was leased and occupied by E.C. Oberthier whose
relative, H.L. Oberthier, later acquired ownership and in turn leased
the property. Ownership changed several times thereafter with tenant
farming the rule right up to the time actual residency on the original
homestead property ceased circa 1960.

The future of Texas is clearly linked to its past. What the
state is - the outlooks and attitudes which characterize it
- and what it will become in the future are the logical
development
from
its roots and traditions.
Historic
preservation in Texas is an important part of the growing
public awareness of and concern for our total environment,
the state's historic patrimony is one of Texas' vital
resources, equally as important as other natural and human
resources.
As has been pointed out by Humphreys and Singleton (1978:84), historic
archeology can make major contributions to the accurate writing or
rewriting of Texas history.
There is a major difference between
stating that LaSalle arrived in Texas in 1684, founding Fort St.
Louis somewhere on the coast, and locating and excavating the specific
site.
Historical documents and records can be used to locate and
describe an event but historical archeology can provide an independent
data collection for corroborating, clarifying, and perhaps modifying
the written record. Since the written record frequently, and quite
naturally, records the unusual, the spectacular and the extremes of
the times rather than the commonplace, usual and unremarkable facets
of everyday life, such records tend to skew our perception of the
times. Material cultural remains considered in the context of their
geographical, physiographical and topographical settings, in addition
to their temporal settings, can help to lessen the distortion.
Previous Investigations
In 1980 Daniel Fox, in an article on Texas historical archeology,
wrote, "Minimal attention has been paid to the material remains of the
period from 1836 to the Civil War in Texas. Only the best known sites
of early Anglo-American Texas have been investigated." (Fox 1980:276).
What held true then for the state holds true for Rusk County now. The
files of the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, the state
repository for site records, shows 103 Rusk County archeological sites
recorded prior to the Walling Cabin. Of this total, 43 are solely or
partially historic in nature. Seventeen of these. date to the era

1836-1860, but fourteen of the seventeen are in a single township,
Harmony Hill (TARL files, Texas Historical Commission 1979:48).
If
the time span considered is further shortened to the era of the Texas
Republic, 1836-1845, only the Taylor Brown Pottery Kiln, 41RK64,
qualifies (TARL files, Moncure and Jackson 1980:27-28). Not one of
the 43 historic sites has been excavated and only one has been tested.
''Minimal attention", appears to adequately and accurately state the
case, at least for Rusk County.
It should be kept in mind that the foregoing makes reference to
historic era material remains in Rusk County which have been subjected
to professional archeological investigation, as distinguished from
historic properties, such as Henderson's Howard-Dickinson House,
preserved, restored, maintained and/or recognized by governmental or
private preservation agencies, societies or individuals.

The Walling Cabin site's chronology begins in period III 8.
In
1980,
the
Texas Archeological
Survey
conducted a
reconnaissance survey of the Mill Creek area of Rusk County (Moncure
and Jackson 1980). Archival research conducted preparatory to and
during that survey brought out the prominence of the Walling family
during Rusk County's early settlement and emphasized their land
holdings
in
the
general Henderson area (Moncure and Jackson
1980:32-36). Included among these lands were those granted to Thomas
Jefferson Walling which were noted even though they were located just
outside the 1980 study area. When the intensive level survey of the
proposed routes for the Martin Lake Mining Area D railroad and
transmission lines was commissioned by Texas Utilities Services, Inc.
in 1981, pre-survey researchers were already aware that the railroad
right-of-way would pass through property once owned by one of the

14

WALLING CABIN

Wallings and had a considerable body of data on that family. When the
cabin was located in 1982 and its possible origin assessed, further
archival
research was
begun.
The historic documentation and
collateral records searched out during that
survey,
and
the
circumstances
and
associations
they
provide,
resulted
in
recommendations and findings which, in turn, led to the cabin being
declared eligible for National Register of Historic Places nomination.
That survey and its aftermath also led to the current, TAS conducted,
archeological mitigation of impact effort, and to the relocation,
reassembly and restoral effort under the auspices of the Rusk County
Historical
Commission
(Shull
1982:letter, Moncure and Jackson
1982:24-34).
EAST TEXAS SETTLEMENT
East Texas settlement, with respect to Anglo-American immigrants
from the United States, really begins with Mexican control of the
area. East Texas at this point had a sparse settlement of Mexicans,
most of them associated with governing or administering the Department
of Nacogdoches, a smattering of persons from Louisiana. more drifters,
adventurers, and refugees than settlers, and a few Anglo-Americans of
the same status. The advent of the empresario system of colonization,
commencing with the Austin Colony's recruitment of prospective
colonists from the United States, laid the ground work for settlement
in East Texas.
The Mexican Republic had fostered a very attractive
colonial program for those who sought economic betterment on a scale
rarely possible within the United States at the time. Under the terms
of the United States land law of 1820, it was possible to obtain 80
acres for $100 plus survey registry fees. Mexican land, in what is
now Texas, could be had by a married man for approximately $200 a
sitio;
4,428 acres (Hafen and Rister 1950:263). The fee, by 1825,
was payable in four, five and six year installments. The empresarios,
to whom large land grants were made for colonization, were rewarded
with land for themselves in proportion to the number of colonists they
could bring to their grants.
The year 1825, 11 the year of the
11
empresarios , saw 25 empresario commissions granted, only one less
than the total of such commissions, and the immigrant stream begun
with the Austin Colony became a flood. Even though Mexico erected new
restrictions on immigration in 1830 and did not relax them until 1853
the flow of immigrants never really stopped (Hafen and Rister
1950:268-269).
After
the
Battle of San Jacinto large scale
immigration was to resume in even greater volume. After a decade of
the empresarios an estimated 20,000 Anglo-Americans and their slaves
were in Texas (Fehrenbach 1968:151). Those near the study area were
situated in the vicinity of Nacogdoches and San Augustine, among them
were the Wallings.
John Walling, the first of the family in Texas, received one of
the last Mexican aegis land grants in what was to become Rusk County.
George Washington Smyth, later the commissioner appointed to fix the
boundary lines between Texas and the United States, acting as land
commissioner of Nacogdoches, awarded Walling one league on the waters

grants to the family.

It was the first of a series of

Many families ultimately resident in Texas had built a tradition
of chain migration to the west (Zelinsky 1973:12, 29). A family
member would, generally for economic reasons, move to a new location
to be followed, in a chain, by other members of the extended family;
brothers, sisters, cousins, in-laws, parents and
grandchildren.
Several generations of a family might be involved in multiple moves,
another "chain" aspect, from one area to another and then on to
another.
The Walling family was involved in just such a chain migration.
John Walling Sr., the clan patriarch, was born in Montgomery County,
Virginia, prior to the American Revolution (Morris 1977:469).
His
oldest son, Jesse, later Texas bound, was born June 17, 1794 in
Hawkins County, Tennessee after the first family move
(Morris
Thomas Jefferson Walling, the fourth son, was born in
1977:469).
White County, Tennessee, in 1811 (Webb 1952, Vol.
2:858), after
another family move.
The family moved on to Covington County,
Mississippi in 1818 then back to Tennessee in 1825 (Dixon and Kemp
1932:351).
John Jr., second eldest of the sons, started the chain to
Texas by moving to Nacogdoches in 1833. Jesse followed suit in 1834.
Alfred and Thomas Jefferson arrived in 1836 after a stop in ~ally
Springs, Mississippi. Cousin Elisha came along in 1838.
Another
brother, James, later also came to Texas.
THE WALLINGS
Once in Texas, the Wallings acquitted themselves
notably.
Brother Jesse joined the First Company Infantry, Second Regiment Texas
Volunteers, a small unit of 45 men under the command of Captain Hayden
Arnold, on March 22, 1836. Private Jesse Walling served until June
22, 1836 (Texas General Land Office, 1978:8ook A:4:6;
Miller
1967:661). This service included the Battle of San Jacinto (Dixon and
Kemp 1932:339). Jesse was later to serve in the Texas legislature as
a member of the House, representing Rusk County in both the Second and
Seventh sessions (Texas Legislature 1962:8, 30;
Smither 1930:162).
Jesse's son, John C., also served with the Texas Volunteers but was
not present at San Jacinto. Another of Jesse's sons, Preston, was
with General Thomas Rusk's militia in the Cherokee Fight in 1838
(Dixon and Kemp 1932:352-353). Cousin Elisha apparently did not fare
as well since he is supposed to have been a member of both the
disastrous Santa Fe and Mier expeditions
(Dixon
and
Kemp
1932:352-353).
If so, he would have been twice imprisoned by Mexican
forces in the space of a year. A record exists of a seventeen year
old named Elisa Walding with the Santa Fe Expedition. He is listed as
being from Alabama but is said to have claimed Warren County,
Tennessee as his birthplace. Walding was among 139 prisoners released
from captivity and put aboard the ship· Rosa Alvina when it sailed from
Vera Cruz, August 12, 1842 bound for Galveston (Loomis 1958:252, 258).

16

WALLING CABIN

It appears Elisha Walding is probably Elisha Walling on the
strength of the collateral evidence (presence in Texas in 1838,
Tennessee origin, the Robertson/Walling letter of 1875). However, for
him to be part of the Mier expedition, Walling would have to return
from Vera Cruz suffering no appreciable effect from the yellow fever
outbreak at that port (Loomis 1958:258) and make his way to San
Antonio to join the Meir forces in September 1842. He would have then
been on his way back to a Mexican prison by December. Using Loomis'
evidence, at least nine and possibly more of the Santa Fe pioneers
participated in both expeditions but Walling (or Walding) is not among
those listed (Loomis 1958:187).
At any rate, the military service and pre-Republic arrival in
Texas of Thomas Jefferson Walling provided stepping stones to another
chain migration of the Wallings, this time to Rusk County following
the lead of elder brother John. Jesse received both first class and
donation land grants based on residence in Texas prior to the
Declaration of Independence and service at San Jacinto (McDonald
1922:419). John C.
Walling received a Rusk County bounty land
warrant for military service and a donation warrant for being on the
baggage detail at Harrisburg at the time of the San Jacinto battle
(Miller 1967:661, 862).
These holdings, coupled with those of the
Chisum family, Jesse's in-laws, provided a certain impetus for Thomas
Jefferson to join or rejoin the group in Rusk County.
Thomas Jefferson Walling
Thomas Jefferson Walling was born in White County, Tennessee in
1811.
By 1825, after two family moves, he was in Fayette County,
Tennessee where he grew to manhood. There he married Nancy Price and
fathered the first two of his nine children by that union. In 1835 he
left Tennessee with his family and moved to
Holly Springs,
Mississippi, where they lived for about a year.
Following his
brothers, he moved again in 1836 to Nacogdoches, Texas arr1v1ng on
January 25. The first real battles of the Texas Revolution - Gonzales
and the siege of San Antonio - had been fought. The Alamo and Goliad
were yet to come. Settling east of Nacogdoches, Thomas Jefferson was
called for military service after the Battle of San Jacinto (Robertson
Arming and equipping· himself, he had ridden as far as
1875).
Nacogdoches when he met a San Jacinto participant, John W. McHorse.
McHorse had just completed his military service as a private in the
same unit as Jesse Walling (Dixon and Kemp 1932:339).
Since McHorse
received a bounty land grant for service, including presence at San
Jacinto, dating from March 6th to June 6th, his chance encounter with
Thomas Jefferson must have occurred shortly thereafter, during the
period when President Burnet was calling for volunteers.
These
volunteers were needed to maintain a credible force against possible
Mexican invasion and to replace those who had finished service
enlistments (Gambrell 1917:26). Walling, mindful of the circumstances
in which he had left his family, hired McHorse to substitute for him
in the military (Robertson 1875) and returned home. Events were such
that a return ·to the business of setting up a farm, near what is now
the
town
of Melrose
in Nacogdoches County, was not to be

HISTORIC BACKGROUND

17

uninterrupted. Thomas Jefferson, under the militia laws of the new
Republic, was enrolled in a unit which could be called out when needed
to protect the people (Gammel 1898:1094-1110).
Determination that
such a state of affairs existed was left to the major general placed
in charge. Major General Thomas Rusk called out these units to combat
the Cordova Rebellion of 1838 and several Indian threats (Gambrell
1917:43, Nance 1963:39-41, Connor 1971:140-142).
Thomas Jefferson
served in the company initially commanded by Captain Davis Muckelroy,
and one under the command of Captain Todd in the district and brigade
of Brigadier General Kelsey H. Douglass (Robertson 1875, Yarbrough
1936:52, Winfrey 1959:76-77). Douglass' brigade was involved in a
number of the 1838 and 1839 encounters with the Cherokees which led to
the expulsion of that tribe from Texas (De Shields 1912:297-304, Webb
1952:879).
With
the reduction of the Indian threat, Walling
apparently elected to relocate near the rest of his family.
In 1839
he obtained the land grant in which the study area lies (Nacogdoches
County Records file 699, Vol. 9, no. 380, and Book C:46).
This land acquisition was based on his presence in Texas at the
time of the declaration of independence from Mexico. The constitution
of 1836 alllowed a head of family a league (a Spanish land measurement
of 4,428 acres) and a labor (177 acres) under such circumstances
(Hogan 1969:10). Thomas Jefferson and family, now including four
children (all sons), moved to what was to become Rusk County and the
study area in the fall of 1841 (Robertson 1875).
The Wallings were typical East Texas settlers in some respects
and quite atypical in others. Based on census-derived information on
East Texas counties, Thomas Jefferson Walling and his wife Nancy were:
younger than the average couple by eight and four years respectively;
had one less child than average at migration; came from the state,
Tennessee, which furnished the most immigrants during the 1836-1840
period; were early arrivals in Texas, both in a general sense and
among migrants from Tennessee; and by 1850 had, like more than 80% of
those having similar arrival dates, aquired land ownership.
The assessed value of the property owned, $5,000 in 1850, would
place their holdings at approximately six times the value of the
median real estate holding for all families of similar arrival date
and three times that of the land holding families, based on nine East
Texas Counties (Lathrop 1949:70-72).
Even with
the
ambiguity
introduced by the family being twice recorded in the 1850 census,
numbers 455 and 715, the lower property value listed ($2,500) in the
second recording is still three times that of the median of all
families and nearly one third greater than the median for land owning
families.
The customary valuation of an acre of land in East Texas
was only one or two dollars per acre (Lathrop 1949:72). At the lower
rate, Walling's 1850 holdings would provide a reasonable match with
$5,000, but would be severely underpriced at $2,500.
The second census recording, taken November 8, 1850, ·has data at
variance with other records. Since it varies on points such as Thomas
Jefferson Walling's own age and the names and ages of some of the

18

WALLING CABIN

children, doubt is cast upon its having resulted from an interview
with a knowledgeable, adult member of the family.
The
first
recording, 455, taken on October 27, 1850, contains data quite
consistent with other documentary sources.
It is not known what the financial status of Thomas Jefferson
Walling was at the time he migrated to Texas, but the standard reason
for emigration according to Lathrop (1949:69) was the hope of economic
betterment. Walling's 1850 economic status with respect to other East
Texas settlers arriving at a similar time indicates a much greater
degree of affluence than most.
Indeed, only twenty nine of 1,054
family heads in Rusk County's 1850 census show assets which equal or
exceed Walling's.
This status is in major part the result of his
early land grant acquisition. This property, larger than that of most
of the farmers of Rusk County, provides a potential economic basis for
funds which could be used for purposes beyond family necessities.
This may have contributed to some cabin features which utilize
materials and methods having greater cost than some alternative means
(e.g. weather boards, wood floors, and an early brick chimney).
The Wallings occupied the homestead from 1841 to 1859 (Rusk
County Deed Records 1859 Book M page 693).
By 1849 four more
children, two girls and two boys, were born to Nancy and Thomas
Jefferson (Dunn 1981:95).
Nancy died in 1853 and Thomas Jefferson
married Eleanor Hardy, formerly a Virginian, in 1854. This union was
to result in four more children, one of which was born while the
family still lived on the Rusk County homestead. The Wallings, on the
move again, sold 307.61 acres of the property to John Harrison, a
farmer from South Carolina, and moved to Hill County in 1859 (Rusk
County Deed Record Book M:693, Probate Records 729).
THE HARRISONS
When the Harrison's acquired the Walling property, the original
league and a labor (4,665 acres) had been diminished by 1,448.5 acres
due to the prior sales of several land parcels (Pearson Abstract Co.
1982).
However, the sale to the Harrisons involved the actual living
quarters of the family (Rusk County Probate file 7Z9, Contract between
B.C. Oberthier and Catherine Harrison 1867) (Figure 5). At the time
they occupied the homestead, the Harrison family included 49 year old
John;
36 year old Catherine; 10 year old twins, A.C., a daughter,
and T.H., a son;
and 8 year old M.Y., another daughter (Dunn
1982:246).
The census data for 1860 shows South Carolina as the
birthplace for both parents, Mississippi that of the twins and Georgia
for the younger daughter (Dunn 1982), indicative of another family
search for the right living circumstances. John Harrison died in 1862
still owing Thomas Jefferson Walling part payment on the property.
Probate of John Harrison's estate was considerably complicated by his
outstanding debts, by debts owed to the estate, the presence of
perishable property (livestock, _salt pork, cotton, corn, forage)
(Figure 6), the changed status of 3 (former) slaves, and the provision
of the Homestead Act preventing forced sale of part of the property.

WALLING CABIN

One court-appointed adminstrator requested an optimistic twelve months
leave of absence in 1863 to join the Confederate Army (Rusk County
Probate file 729).
A second appointed adminstrator petitioned the
county court in 1866 to set aside a court ordered sale of 107 2/3
acres of the property when the high bid was only 65 cents per acre
(Rusk County Probate File 729). Repeated attempts were made to sell
the services of the three slaves, with mixed results. By 1867, with
the estate still unsettled, Catherine Harrison was renting the
property to B.C. 'Oberthier and identifying it as "my entire premises
(viz) the farm and houses formerly occupied by T.J. Walling Sen. 11
(Figure 5) (Rusk County Probate file 729). Finally, in 1869, the
property was offered for sale at auction at the courthouse door and
brought a price of $815.00 from H.L. Oberthier (Rusk County Deed
Records 1869, Book Q:554). Apparently this sale did not satisfy all
concerned for in 1874 H.L. Oberthier obtained full deed on payment of
$160.00 to Catherine Harrison (Rusk County Deed Records, Book V:473).
The property was then described as 11 A part of the T.J. Walling league
and further known as the John Harrison place upon which said Oberthier
now resides 11 (Rusk County Deed Records 1874, Book V:473). Whether
renter E.C. Oberthier lived on the premises is not known but the
foregoing would place H.L.
Oberthier as in residence there. It
appears that the widow Harrison may have moved from the homestead even
earlier than the rental to E.C. Oberthier in 1867. The emphasis on
disposing of perishable goods and supplies evidenced in the probate
records, including the livestock, the renting out of slaves, the
reference in the rental agreement to the repair of the fences
11
sufficient to secure his crop" all point to the farm not being kept
up or in operation (Rusk County Probate file 729) (Figures 5 and 7).

,

Those slaves whose services were offered to the highest bidder by
the administrator of Harrison 1 s estate included only an adult male and
two small boys, one so young that he was not bid for and was put out
for service for his 11 victuals 11 and medical care (Rusk County Probate
file 729, 1863). This would appear to indicate that even if hiring
out could not supply a profit it was still considered appropriate.
The 1860 census records show John Harrison owning the aforementioned
adult male and two boys as well as two adult females (United States
Department of Commerce, Eighth Federal Census 1860 Schedule 2, page
77, lines 9-13). Both females have vanished by the time of Harrison 1 s
death in 1862. The census records also show Harrison owning one slave
dwelling in 1860. Yet in 1867 the rental agreement between Catherine
Harrison and E.C. Oberthier (Figure 5) calls for the latter to 11 build
two cabins for freedmen 11 which would seem unnecessary if the slave
dwelling mentioned in the 1860 census report was still extant.
Why
there is a need to build two cabins for three people, two of them
still not teenaged, is not clear. For that matter, since they were
freedmen in 1867, why it was necessary to build anything at all for
them isn 1 t clear. It is somewhat remarkable that Catherine Harrison,
beset with financiai difficulties and faced with a significant
reduction of the estate's value by the emancipation of the slaves
finds it appropriate to provide housing for the freedmen when renting
out the homestead.

24

WALLING CABIN

Further evidence of the non-operational status of the farm
shortly after Harrison's death is seen in the differences between the
estate inventory of January 3, 1863 and the inventory of July 5, 1864
(Figures 6 and 8). Missing from the 1864 inventory are one horse, two
saddles, one hundred fifty pounds of pork, one bushel of peas, one
wagon, thirty three stock hogs, twelve pork hogs, one lot of corn, one
lot of fodder, another lot of seed cotton and a yoke of oxen, all
present in the 1863 inventory. In addition, twelve head of cattle
were reduced to five, one of the latter a calf. The probate records
show a petition to sell perishable goods and it appears that much of
what was required to continue to operate the farm was disposed of, in
particular the horse, oxen, wagon, stock hogs, corn and the seed
cotton. The widow and her children may, however, have continued to
live on the property without farming it. A speculative solution to
her family's disposition is that until she was able to finally resolve
the estate and pass the property on to H.L. Oberthier in the 1870s,
she was assisted by the owner of an adjacent property, Andrew
Harrison, who may have been kin to her and her late husband. He may
even have been her son. The neighbor purchased his land from Thomas
Jefferson Walling (69 1/2 acres) on the same day John Harrison
acquired the study area homestead (Rusk County Deed Records, Book
P:391,392).
In the 1860 census he is listed, like John Harrison, as
born in South Carolina (Dunn 1982:247). His listed age of 25 in 1860
makes him a possible son of the 52 year old John and the Georgia
birthplaces of his wife and three children coincides with the Georgia
birthplace of John's youngest child. Catherine Harrison, if she was
Andrew's mother, would have been but fourteen years old when he was
born, but this does not preclude her that status. Alternatively, she
may have been John Harrison's
second
spouse.
Whatever the
relationship, the circumstantial and indirect evidence favors some
form of kinship and a potential source of assistance.
THE OBERTHIERS
B.C. Obertheir rented the old Walling place from Catherine
Harrison in 1867. B.C., a veteran of Company B, 14th Cavalry, Ector's
Brigade, Hood's Division during the Civil War, was the first of
several
Oberthiers associated with the former Walling property
(Winfrey 1951:273). H.L. Oberthier, a brother, during a temporary
sojourn from ranching, bought the property at court ordered auction in
1869 and continued the transaction with a payment to Mrs. Harrison in
1874 (Rusk County Deed Records, Book Q:554, Book V:473). He was,
Three
according to the deed records, in residence on the property.
children were born while H.L. was owner, (1869-1877) Frederick, Susan
and John (Gracy, Sumner and Gentry 1978:121, Woodward and Tiernan
1895:452) which may make the cabin the birthplace of six Wallings and
three Oberthiers. In 1877 H.L. Oberthier deeded the property to
W.A. Hubbard, a relative from his wife's side of the family. The
property is described as "in litigation between myself (Oberthier) and
Mrs.
Catherine Harrison 11 (Rusk County Deed Records, Book V:357).
Finally, apparently unencumbered, passage of the property to Hubbard
came in 1879 (Rusk County Deed Records, Book 27:45). Hubbard added

HISTORIC BACKGROUND

25

the property to his other land holdings in the vicinity and sold it in
1894 as part of a larger tract of 635.8 acres to J.A. Vinson. This
larger tract also included the 69 1/2 acres formerly owned by Andrew
Harrison (Rusk County Deed Records, Book 43:104), indicating that the
Harrison's were finally retiring from the scene and adds further
evidence
of some link between Catherine and Andrew.
Vinson's
Neither Hubbard nor
ownership carries into the twentieth century.
Vinson is known to have resided in the cabin and the homestead is
never again treated as a separate entity but is dealt with in tandem
with tracts of the surrounding property, not all of which were in the
original T.J. Walling land grant.
TWENTIETH CENTURY OWNERS
Twentieth century owners, other than Vinson, include the several
claimants to the Vinson estate: C.A. Price, who bought the property
through the estate administrator, E.C. Oberthier, brother of B.C. and
H.L., several Price family members in joint ownership, and Clyde B.
Green, owner at the time of the survey which identified the origin of
the cabin.
None of these are known to have resided in the Walling
cabin during their ownership. It is known that there were several
occupancies by lessors, tenants, share croppers and hired hands. In
the 1920s, two related families operated the farm and lived in an
expanded version of the homestead. Through the kindness of one of the
family members, Mr. Preston Young, now resident in nearby Henderson,
photographs of the house as it was in the 1920s were made available.
Copies and enlargements of some of these photographs are included in a
later section of this report.
Mr. Young was also able to supply
firsthand information regarding outbuildings,
materials,
water
sources, land use and more. A chronology of events concerned with the
Walling Cabin is given in Table 1.

RESEARCH DESIGN

BACKGROUND AND PREFACE
The cabin was located during an in~ensive survey of the proposed
route of a railroad to be constructed by Texas Utilities Services Inc.
This railroad will carry lignite from a mining area to be developed in
central Rusk County to the Texas Utilities Generating Company's
electrical power generating plant at Martin Lake near the Rusk/Panola
The cabin was found to be situated in the right-of-way
county line.
of the proposed railway with the centerline of that right-of-way
passing through one corner of the structure (Figure 3). Construction
of the railway would destroy the cabin and its associa~ed features
(Moncure and Jackson 1982:24-34). These features include a well, a
postulated well, a postulated root cellar/trash disposal pit, a relict
garden with handmade brick scattered through it, and a rectangular
depression anomalous to the natural topography.
Preliminary archival research and consultation with both the Rusk
County Historical Commission and the Texas Historical Commission led
to the conclusion that this property, or at least the original single
pen log structure, was probably eligible for nomination to the
National Register of Historic Places.
Following the
requisite
documentation, a request for a determination of eligibility was
submitted in May 1982 by the United States Environmental Protection
Agency with concurring determination forwarded by the State Historic
Preservation Officer.
On June 30, 1982, that eligibility was
confirmed as determined by the Keeper of the National Register for the
Secretary of the Interior (Shull 1982). The eligibility notification
states that 11 if the cabin is moved and restored, it should be
nominated on its new site, 11 and suggests the investigation of the
(present) site and its nearby features (Shull 1982). As a practical
matter, the rerouting of the proposed railway to shift it to either
side of the cabin location would have routed it close to an existing
pipeline and resulted in changed grade and curve specifications.
Mitigation in the form of recording and testing of the cabin and
associated features and the relocation and restoral of the early log
pen was the better solution. The Texas Archeological Survey (TAS),
the Rusk County Historical Commission, and Texas Utilities Services,
Inc.
(TUSI) collaborated in a plan to accomplish the investigation,
relocation, restoral and documentation. Within this plan, TAS was

TUSI was to produce, with TAS comments, measured drawings based
on
Historic American Building Survey (HABS) standards, furnish
equipment for mechanical excavation, and the equipment and manpower to
disassemble the cabin.
The Rusk County Historical Commission was to provide the new
location for the reassembly/restoral, assume ownership and custody of
the cabin, conduct the reassembly/restoral in such a manner as to
permit nomination to the National Register upon completion in the new
location and furnish it authentically "to the period".
RESEARCH OBJECTIVES
The research objectives are stated as keynote queries designed
to: (1) address documentation of the site's ownership, occupancy, era
association and identification of its features and their usage;
(2)
provide a record of the site as found; (3) provide a basis for site
and site component and artifact analysis; (4) provide a basis for
disassembly, relocation and restoral decisions;
(5) provide the
background for the restoral process.
Keynote Queries
A group of questions relative to documenting,
analyzing,
relocating and restoring the site were developed to guide field
operations. The methodology pursued in the field was designed from
these questions and altered where necessary to take into account the
answers produced and their implications.

Discussion:
Direct answers to the above questions require
supporting documentation acquired by a search through land title,
probate, commissioners court, census, tax, personal papers
and
collateral records. Secondary sources such as biographies, histories,
newspaper and periodi~al files and the like are considered potentially
less accurate, but are used to locate primary sources and as a source
themselves when the primary source is lacking.
Vanity press items,
those publications where the contents are generated by the relatives
and friends of the subject and published by a company for a fee, are
generally lacking in completeness, contain few references to primary

sources and are most
relationships, event dates and clues to further archival search. Oral
history accounts, other than eye witness accounts, are acceptable
sources when strong corroboration is available but tend to develop
additions and/or deletions as time passes from what is being
described.
Eye witness accounts are subject to the same distortion,
but are more likely to produce clues to corroborative sources and
enriched detail .
As a pertinent example of oral history peculiarities, the Santa
Fe and Mier expeditions are regarded by some as heroic adventures
leading to U.S. claims on large areas of the Southwest.
Elisha
Walling's participation in these expeditions is listed in the Handbook
of Texas (Webb 1952, Vol. 2:858). However, the Texas Almanac (Belo
Corporation 1982-1983 edition:359, 360) describes the results of the
Santa Fe as "disastrous" and the Mier as a defeat. The Handbook entry
is based on a secondary account of Elisha Walling's exploits written
by his cousin, Thomas Jefferson Walling, over 30 years after the
events had occurred. The Almanac accounts are much condensed, "bare
facts', descriptions of those events.
The T.J. Walling
source
contains information about its author which can be corroborated, and
some regarding brother Jesse which can be otherwise supported.
While
Elisha's participation in the Santa Fe expedition is reasonably
supported, his presence during the Mier expedition is not and was
unlikely (see Historical Background). Every effort must be made to
unearth contemporary documentation in answering the keynote queries
with secondary sources identified as such, and with credence given
accordingly.

Discussion: Attribution to original construction is contingent
upon recognition of materials, circumstances and methods on hand,
extant and in use during the era, and the absence of evidence of later
employment or replacement. It is, for example, reasonable to accept
the cabin's 800-900 pound sill logs as the original due to their state
of curing, surface condition, and the monumental task of replacing
them without modern house jacks or the complete disassembly of the
cabin.
The presence of a partial layer of hand-rived shakes, under a
layer of wood shingles, under composition shingles, in turn under
corrugated tin roofing establishes the former as the probable original
and definitely eliminates the latter three from consideration.

OPERATING METHODS AND PROCEDURES
SITE MAPPING
Site mapping was accomplished with an alidade, plane table,
pocket transit, metric rod, steel tapes, an optical measuring device,
and center-fall plumb bobs.
The operation was guided by the
requirements of Historic American Building Survey standards and
followed procedures detailed in, among others, Herubin (1974) and
Kenyon (1961:115-122).
A professional land survey of the cabin location had been done in
March 1982 by G.Q. Carmichael Inc. and the results were available for
TAS use (Figure 3). The locations shown in the main drawing and two
inserts pinpoint the cabin and were used to orient and establish a

established on the site to allow unimpeded feature mapping. All
intra-site measurements were made from these secondary points.
A
reduced version of the site map is included as Figure 9.
PHOTOGRAPHIC RECORD
A detailed photographic record of the site, its component
structures,
features,
and
surroundings was compiled following
guidelines of the Historic American Buildings Survey as the minimum
requirement (McKee 1970:69).
To insure an accurate record and to aid interpretation, analysis
and restoration, photographic coverage was accomplished in both 4 by S
in and 35 mm format using a variety of color and black and white films
and lenses. Subject matter photographed using various exposure times
was employed to insure full photographic evidence.
Experience has
shown
this
to be valuable in capturing detail for analysis.
Similarly, enlarging and printing variants were employed to emphasize
details under analysis. A record set of photographs was produced for
inclusion in the documentation package accompanying the request for
determination of eligibility of the cabin for the National Register.
SURFACE ARTIFACT SEARCH
An initial surface search for cultural material was conducted to
establish the limits of the sheet refuse/trash scatter. Limits on
this search were the county road to the south and collateral azimuths
and an interval of 12 paces without evidence of cultural material in
all other directions. The greatest amount of surface material was
located to the south extending to the fence bordering the road; a
short distance east to the gate off that road, and west to the edge of
the
relict garden where construction debris was present.
The
remainder of the surface material was close to the structure itself
with a lobe extending west of it for 30 feet and a smaller lobe

WALLING CABIN

extending in a rough parabola 20 feet off the east side (Figure 4).
The entire area was open to livestock and used as pasturage and
indications of past cultivation were noted in the area to the east of
the cabin. Additionally, in the interim between the cabin's discovery
and the commencement of mitigaton operations, vandals employed a metal
detector in the vicinity of the cabin and left a score of holes
testifying to their activities. It is not known what surface-located
items these vandals may have removed, if any. The results of their
efforts are partially known from the holes they left and from a
probably incomplete discard pile of recently dug artifacts found by
the county road. These are covered later in this report (see Metal
Detector Search below).
A few artifacts from the surface were
collected in cases where possible diagnostic value existed or where
identification could not be established by initial inspection.
FEATURE EXCAVATION AND IDENTIFICATION
The several cabin site features recorded during the intensive
survey were individually investigated utilizing machine assisted
excavation with the exception of the well located nearest the cabin
structure.
This well, dry at the time of the initial survey, is
upslope from a second feature postulated at .the time of the survey to
be either a well or privy and initial opinion held that it predated
the downslope feature and was abandoned as dry when that feature, if
in fact a well, was dug.
An informant, Mr. Preston Young, an
occupant of the cabin in the 1920s, identified the downslope feature
as a well and stated the upslope well wasn't present when he lived on
the property. This placed a not earlier than the 1920s date on the
upper well and eliminated possible nineteenth century and early
twentieth century artifactual content. Visual inspection revealed the
well to still be dry and without evidence of any seconday use as a
trash disposal hole.
Further investigaton was abandoned at this
point.
The excavations conducted on the root cellar, lower well, the
rectangular depression, and garden/construction material area and the
trenching of a foundation line area north and downslope from the cabin
are individually treated in subsequent sections of this report.
METAL DETECTOR SEARCH METHODOLOGY
A metal detector search of the area previously subjected to
visual surface search was conducted to ascertain the extent of
responsive material shallowly buried in proximity to the cabin and its
associated features. Once this had been accomplished, the area of the
greatest number of 11 hits 11 was resurveyed and the 11 hits 11 marked with
flags to provide a visually apparent pattern for comparison with the
visual surface search
and
to
facilitate
artifact
recovery.
Confirmation of detection was accomplished by hand excavation of 20
percent of the 11 hits 11 in the area of concentration. The identificaton
of the area of greatest concentration included the holes left by the
vandals referred to previously.

METHODS AND PROCEDURES

35

The location and recovery of artifacts with a metal detector is
not limited to metallic-signal producing items. Because items lost or
discarded and subsequently buried are not likely to be sorted by
material type, the location of metallic items is likely to coincide
with that of non-metallic items. The manufacturers of metal detectors
and their dealers routinely tout their products as useful to the
bottle and collectibles prospectors in recognition of this frequent
association.
The
literature cites
results bearing out this
relationship (von Mueller 1979:55-57).
There are several types of metal detectors extant differing
basically in the portion of the electromagnetic frequency spectrum
used and in the circuitry design that produces the indication of
metallic presence. Within these types are a large variety of brands,
models, and variants in search head performance, such that it is
appropriate to state the specific type, brand and model used and to
note that such a search as was conducted here should be accomplished
using a single instrument or the results will be non-uniform. It is
also appropriate to note that the performance of a metal detecting
instrument is closely linked with the familiarity of the operator with
the instrument. Metal detectors, like non-automated cameras, require
experience and practice to produce consistent results. The inst~ument
used here is a transmitter-receiver type with an 8 inch search coil,
produced as
the Bounty Hunter II model by Pacific Northwest
Electronics. The operator, the author, had seven years of use
experience with this instrument.
In addition to the area search, the metal detector was employed
during the test excavations of the area beneath the cabin. Since it
was not practical to excavate the entire under-cabin area due to time
and funding limits, the selection of locations for excavation was
aimed at providing the maximum possible nineteenth century artifact
recovery.
Detector use served three purposes. First, a sweep of the
area beneath the cabin revealed which areas were the foci of positive
indications of metal presence. That information reinforced literature
and experience-based opinion that the most likely areas for excavation
were entrances and the locus of heaviest household activity, in this
case the hearth. Secondly, the flagging of detector hits provided a
forewarning to the excavators of artifact presence. Thirdly, the use
of the detector, followed by excavation, served. to demonstrate and
establish confidence in the method's utility where total excavation is
not possible. The specifics of metal detector use are included in the
descriptions of the activities where it provided support.
THE CABIN-RECORDING COMPONENTS
A detailed examination of the entire structure was conducted to
ascertain the components of the original log pen, the components of
the later additions and alterations, fix the current and, if possible,
the original position of individual structural members and note
construction techniques. Original log pen status for a structural
member was determined by the material used, its position in the

36

WALLING CABIN

structure, the presence of appropriate tool marks, use of appropriate
fastening or joining methods, and its construction sequence position.
Additions were identified using the same criteria plus the use of
marks on original pen material resulting from subsequent construction.
Positioning of structural members was recorded
to
assist
in
reconstruction and original pen components were marked with numbered
metal tags keyed to a diagram.
This examination proceeded in two
phases.
Components were examined as the structure stood, foundation
to roof, and then again during disassembly. Close attention was given
to the · marks left by too 1s used in the mid nineteenth century and to
the nails.
Those parts identified and tagged as original pen components were
evaluated with respect to completeness and structural soundness. In
some cases, alterations were evident in original components made to
accomodate additions to the basic structure. These were noted for
inclusion in the Historic American Buildings Survey measured drawings
set.
The tool marks referred to are distinctive patterns left by use
of the felling axe, possibly the adze, the broad axe, the froe, pit
saw, brick mold and chisel. The marks of the felling axe and those of
an adze to shape wood are indistinguishable one from the other, but
the marks left by either evidence hand hewing of wood (Figure lOa).
Ironically, the use of an adze to smooth wood shaped by using first a
felling axe and then a broad axe may remove all but inferential
evidence of the use of the axes. Froe marks can be seen at one of the
edges of a shake or shingle if the wood has not deteriorated very
much. Pit saw marks lack the curvature of circular saw marks and tend
to be less regular than pole, sash or reciprocal mill saw marks
(Sloane 1973:26).
Also of interest were some handmade bricks with mold marks on the
strecher sides.
These result from the scratching of the shaped but
unfired clay when dumped from the inverted mold. The scratches may be
the result of imperfections in the mold itself or from sand introduced
into the mold to keep the clay from clinging. (Foster 1952:64, Davis
1889:131, Crary 1890:79). Another handmade brick mold mark resulting
from the plane or striker, a tool used to shear off excess clay,
occurs on one of the rowlock stretcher surfaces of the brick.
Fastening and joining characteristics used as identifiers are
nail types, notching types, pointing of mortar joints (also a tool
mark) and woodshaping (lapping, grooving, chamfering, mortising and
tapering).
Nail types and their characteristics are discussed in the
artifact descriptions. The details of the joining characteristics are
included in the discussion of the cabin components where examples
occur.

WALLING CABIN

CABIN DISASSEMBLY AND RELOCATION
A four man crew of professional house movers was furnished by
TUSI to accomplish the disassembly of the cabin and to move the
portions to be used in restoral to the new location in Henderson.
Disassembly proceeded under the guidance of the TAS crew and was
conducted entirely by hand/hand tool removal of parts.
Each part,
commencing with the uppermost, was freed from later additions fastened
to it (shims, furring strips, weather boards, interstice covering
boards,. battens, etc.) and lifted, with the use of ropes where
necessary, from its place in the structure. These structural members,
already recorded and tagged while in place, were re-examined for
characteristics previously not visible or apparent.
Samples of the
nails, if any, attaching other components to them were collected.
This procedure continued down to and included the foundation field
stones, but excluded the chimney/fireplace. The base of the chimney
and the hearth were left in place for further investigation.
The
upper portions of the chimney and the fireplace were pulled down and
relegated to the group of non-original materials not useful in
restoration.
Both were of recent vintage since they were made from
pressed brick bearing a brand name, Cole, and were marked with a

sufficient to disqualify the brick from

consideration, and collectively they place their use not earlier than
the mid-1930s. An informant confirmed the construction of the upper
chimney and fireplace took place after the 1939 purchase of the
property by Clyde B. Green (Green 1982). The chimney base, however,
contained handmade brick and field stone.
The process of disassembly uncovered a few artifacts not part of
the structure but hidden within it. These were collected and are
included in the artifact descriptions section of this report.
All tagged cabin components, foundation stones to roof supports,
were moved to the custody of the Rusk County Historical Commission for
storage. Restoration was accomplished on City of Henderson/Rusk
County property adjacent to the Depot Museum.
EXCAVATION BENEATH THE CABIN
The area beneath the cabin was selected as that having the most
potential for recovery of artifacts dating to the earlier occupations
of the structure. The cabin was floored from the first, as evidenced
by its elevation from the ground surface on field stone pillars and by
the use of large log floor joists. The early flooring method employed
left sufficient space for many small items to fall through and perhaps
survive.
Wood flooring, even if seasoned, will shrink as it dries,
creating cracks between the boards.
Many early floors were laid
puncheon style. These were wide boards, loosely, if at all, attached
to the joists such that when sh~inkage and warping became a problem
they could be moved, turned over, or replaced. A factor tending to

METHODS AND PROCEDURES

39

encourage rapid shrinkage/drying and unequal drying/warpage was the
use of the fireplace. Flooring closest to this heat source would be
most affected by shrinking and warping. Add to this the fireplace
hearth's status as the locale of cooking activity and the source of
heating and light and it becomes a focal point for human activity
within the cabin.
An excavation under the
hearth
area
was
accomplished to take advantage of the above circumstances and to
permit the simultaneous investigation of the fireplace/chimney base.
A 2 by 2 m square bounded on the east by the fireplace/chimney base
was excavated. The results are recorded in the Excavations section.
A second 2 by 2 m square was excavated so as to cover the area
formerly beneath the entrance to the original structure and was
extended south approximately 1.5 m. The front wall of the structure
was
oriented very slightly north of an east-west line.
The
excavation, however, was placed with its sides aligned with the
cardinal directions.
The placement of this excavation was a field
decision supported by the knowledge that the earth under the original
entrance was at some point covered by a porch addition which furnished
some protection and shifted human traffic activity away from the area.
This information came from an informant visiting the site before
excavation.
The selection of this location was based on
the
assumption that the high level of early activity lessened with the
addition of the porch which, in turn, protected the early deposits.
No other area beneath the structure except the hearth showed as many
"hits" during the metal detector sweep or was demonstrably an activity
area of the same magnitude.
INFORMANTS
No formal program to seek out and interview informants was found
necessary.
The high local interest in the project resulted in news
media coverage which included articles in five newspapers, several of
which carried follow-up articles, at least two TV news broadcasts,
several radio interviews, and a TUSI-produ~ed video taped interview.
The TAS crew conducted informal interviews based on key queries to
excellent advantage. Informants arrived on site in quantity.
During
the "press day 11 when TUSI · presented the cabin to Rusk County in a
ceremony on location, eight people who had lived in or visited the
cabin while it was still occupied were present.
The matter of
city/county acquisition placed the cabin 1 s future on the Henderson
City Council's meeting agenda and brought it to the attention of
county officials. TUSI public relations personnel made appropriate
press releases and responded to media interest. One informant, Mr.
Preston Young, previously mentioned, kindly furnished the TAS. crew
with photographs of the structure and its surroundings as it was in
the 1920s. He and his wife also consented to an interview at their
home in Henderson.
The results of those interviews are integrated
into the sections of this report on which they have a bearing and the

WALLING CABIN

The value of the informant information appears to far exceed the
information lost when vandals used a metal detector to steal some
artifacts buried in the vicinity. That this vandalism was Walling
Cabin specific and cued by publicity is evidenced by the vandals
having ignored two equally accessible, but unpublicized, abandoned
house sites nearby on the same county road.
HISTORIC ARTIFACT COLLECTION DESIGN
Prior to the field phase of investigation
the
following
conclusions were derived from the archivally recorded history of the
cabin's use and occupation:
1. Surface artifact finds could assist in answering few keynote
queries other than those involving,physical relationships. Such finds
would have only site provenience, and unless demonstrably early or
personalized, would be useful chiefly in establishing patterning,
concentration locations, and the like.
2. Material recovered from associated features, unless part of
the feature or residue from its primary use would probably be the
result of trash disposal.
Since trash disposal would reasonably
follow discontinuation of the original use of the feature, the
artifacts disposed of would be predominantly those of a time later
than the earliest occupations of the cabin site.
3. Artifacts recovered from subsurface locations other than the
features or the area under and immediate to the cabin would contribute
mostly to determining physical relationships.
4. Considering the number of persons who resided in the cabin,
the number of family moves to other locales and the long time
available for premium (attractive, valuable, novel, reusable) items to
be removed from the site, only the most unusual circumstances would
provide artifacts strongly attributable to the Wallings or Harrisons.
5. The most useful artifact category would be those items used
in the construction of the cabin and its alterations or additions. If
detectable, those could provide era
attribution,
sequence
of
construction, and an insight into materials available during a given
era.
As a consequence of the above, artifact collection concentrated
on recovery of the materials which were part of the structure and
those from the test squares under and adjacent to it. Trash disposal
in features built for another purpose was investigated to the base of
the trash deposits but collection was confined to material which might
be diagnostic of a time era.
Artifacts collected consist primarily of metal goods, ceramics
and glass.
The metal goods category is primarily the nails used in
the structure. The ceramics are predominantly sherds from disposal

areas or resulting from the surface search. The glass category is
partially that from the under cabin excavations and partially that
recovered from trash disposal. The nails, as a result of provenience,
number of examples and number of types, offered the most promise for
analysis.
A description of this analysis and the conclusions drawn
from it is included in the artifact section of this report.
Several other categories of artifacts were recovered in small
quantities which, although not integral structure parts, offered
possibilities for chronological information.
Buttons,
firearms
ammunition remains, shells and cases, and bricks are addressed in the
artifacts section.

THE CABIN FARMSTEAD
We seek to discover and convey a sense of daily life as it might
have been experienced by the people who lived in the cabin. Central
to this is the changing complement of features which made up the cabin
farmstead.
The single pen cabin forms its base unit. We have, in
Thomas Jefferson Walling 1 s statement to E.S.C. Robertson (Robertson
1875), documentation of his family's relocation to the site in the
fall of 1841. The construction of the cabin would have been the first
order of business.
T.J. Walling had access to the required labor.
His relatives, Jesse, John and John Sr., with their several grown
children and the Chisum inlaws all over Rusk County would have been
more than enough to accomplish the job in short order.
In addition,
Jesse, John, and Thomas Jefferson were all slave owners by 1850,
according to the U.S. Census (U.S. Department of Commerce 1850,
Schedule 2:357,358), and may have had such labor available earlier.
The primary raw material, wood, was locally abundant and brother Jesse
had participated in mill operations. The record is ambiguous as to
whether Jesse built or bought or operated or
financed
the
water-powered mill at nearby Millville, but at any rate the facility
was available. Thomas Jefferson Walling was not a newly arrived
settler but had been in Texas for more than five years and had had
time to accumulate some of the supplies which might have to be
obtained non-locally or which required fabrication. Some furnishings,
hardware, and hard-to-manufacture items doubtless were brought from
his previous home.
In sum, the property, labor, materials and
facilities were all available in the fall of 1841.
One of the advantages to a log building is that this type of
construction is at once the load bearing frame, the outer wall, the
inner wall, the roof support, the insulation, and, if need be, a
fortification.
It is a basic structure usable as is or as a keystone
to a more elaborate structure. Many outward appearing framed houses
have log structures at the core, hidden by additions. One key to many
of these additions and modifications was the need for additional space
to accomodate a growing family. Another lies in the very simplicity
of the structure. Since log buildings are affordable to anyone with
access to wood, they were the basic housing type of all social
classes: slaves, tenants, overseers, settlers, merchants, and at one
point even the capitol building of the state of Texas (Smithwick
1900:261). There was a tendency among log home residents to alter
these buildings, both in size and appearance, as soon as possible in
order to display enhanced social status. It was normal to make the
necessary or desired openings after the walls were put up (Bealer
1978:44, Beard 1914:165, Connor 1949:112, Weslager 1969:18 among
others).
Windows could easily be added or converted. to doors. To
change the outward appearance weather boards were frequently employed.
These are an uncomplicated siding method where untapered planks are

CABIN FARMSTEAD

43

simply fastened to the wall, inside, outside, or both. They may abut
one another to provide a continuous facade or they may cover only the
interstices between logs. Since the side walls of the Walling Cabin
do not have closely fitting log members (Figure 11) and show no
evidence of chinking, it appears that weather boards may have been
used on these walls from the first. By contrast, the front and rear
wall did have closely fitting log members (Figure 11) which shows that
the hewing and fitting expertise to construct such a wall was held by
the builders. A possible explanation for this difference is that due
to the season of the year some haste was required in readying the
cabin fo~ occupancy and use was made of weather boards already on hand
from the Nacogdoches house in lieu of careful, time consuming notching
of the side wall logs. Weather boards, as with any made-to-shape
wooden item, would have been subject to far less warping if allowed to
season rather than used while green (Sloane 1965:22).
Logs, by
contrast, are normally used in the green state, curing in place under
the pressures imposed by the construction method (Langsner 1982:48).
Load bearing faces of notches actually tighten up as the seasoning of
green logs proceeds.
The roof was probably shake covered. A few shakes show up as the
lower layer of four types of roofing material found still partially
covering the single log pen. Shakes are quickly riven, by means of a
froe, provided the operator has had some experience. The number of
relocations made by the Wallings prior to arrival in Rusk County would
have offered ample opportunity to acquire the necessary skill.
Based on the presence of modern machine produced brick, handmade
brick, and an uncemented or unmortared rock base in the cabin chimney
as found, it appears probable that the original chimney was the stick
and mud type, a "cat" chimney.
The unmortared stone would be
incongruent with a stone chimney which would have required mortaring.
The several months required to dig and cure brick clay, mold it, and
burn the clamp before use does not fit the time available.
The
possibility of buying previously produced brick cannot be totally
ruled out. However, the 1850 census, nine years later than the
cabin's construction, shows only one brickmason and seven bricklayers
in Rusk County and shows other data which rules out all but one
bricklayer
being
present
in
the
county
in
1841
(Dunn
1981:25,34,35,47,96,124, and 133). On the face of -the evidence the
"cat" chimney, described later in this report, is the choice for the
initial chimney. It was replaced with a brick one, probably after
Henderson was founded and the demand for brick spurred that industry
in
the
area.
Modern
brick was
used
in

fireplace/chimney, after the 1939 purchase of the property by Mr.
Green.
Once the log pen, roof, and chimney are in place and the floor is
laid, the latter possibly making use of boards brought from the
Nacogdoches house, the cabin then requires only the cutting of the
appropriate openings for occupancy to begin. The log pen, as found,
had three doors, two front windows and a small window adjacent to the
fireplace opening (Figures 12a, b). The materials used in the rear

WALLING CABIN

shed room mark it as a later addition to the structure with a doorway
entering it. The position of the hardware marks on the door frame and
the position of the latch show that this door, now missing, swung into
the log cabin pen.
The west wall door, from tool mark evidence
described later herein, was once a window and was enlarged to make a
door when the cabin was expanded by the addition of a second non-log
pen with a dogtrot hallway between the two pens. Cuts left by the use
of an axe or hatchet on the front wall logs beneath the two front
window openings provide space for the hands when opening top hinged
window shutters. No sign of similar cuts appear at the corners of the
west wall window/door. The front windows were eventually sashed and
glazed and it appears the west wall window may have been an addition
at that point. In sum, the openings in the original cabin pen were
the door in the center of the front wall, the two windows facing it,
the fireplace/chimney opening and the small window adjacent to the
fireplace.
The small window is not an unusual feature. It permitted
fuel to be moved from the woodpile into the hearth area with a minimum
of carrying.
Walled, roofed, floored, fireplace/chimney in place and showing
three windows and a single door the log cabin is ready for occupancy
by the Walling family. At that time there were six members. In this
single log pen, approximately 325 square feet of living space, the
indoor living activities of the family took place.
Furnishings
necessarily were sparse by modern standards.
The 1863 probate
inventory of the John Harrison estate (Figure 6) is probably fairly
representative of what was present in terms of furniture type:
one candle stand and small table
one lot of crockery
one lot of bedclothes
one looking glass
one lot of kitchen furniture
one dining table
three mattresses

three bedsteads
one loom
seven chairs
one kettle
two blankets
two Bibles
one trunk

Additions to the house had probably been made by Harrison 1 s time.
The 1867 Harrison/Oberthier rental agreement refers to 11 the farm and
houses (plural) formerly occupied by T.J. Walling 11 (Figure 5).
Thus,
quantities of a given item are suspect but the list is probably close.
Given the Walling family size of six and its composition of four sons
aged 7, 6, 4, and 1, a single bedstead and mattress is a more likely
circumstance. The three older children probably slept on easily
stored pallets on the floor, the youngest with his parents. The chair
complement would probably not have exceeded the number of family
members and a more usual seating arrangement would have included a
backless bench for the children in lieu of individual chairs.
The
dining (and all purpose) table, candle stand and small table, loom,
trunk and Bible are normal to the era and place. The trunk stored a
variety of personal items, special clothes, and the bedclothes not in
use. Everyday clothing hung from the walls on nails or pegs.
The

crockery,

and

tableware, and flatware), were stored in the hearth area, many of them

hanging from the wall.
The "looking glass" is not a mirror or its
evaluation would be much higher than the $1.00 listed.
"Looking
glass" is a vernacular term for a chamber pot (Deetz 1977:10), a far
more practical furnishing than a mirror given the lack of indoor
plumbing.
The lack of space inside the cabin is not as confining or
limiting as it might seem.
The primary indoor activities were
sleeping, cooking and eating and the preparations for and aftermaths
of these activities.
Except for the hearth area, specific activity
space was minimal. The bedstead was drawn closer to the fire when
more heat was wanted.
When this happened it and its complement of
pallets displaced the dining table, chairs and bench, only to be
shoved back into a corner when those items needed to be used. The
loom and a chair undoubtedly spent a good deal of time outside during
the warmer part of the year.
The fireplace was at once the heat
source, kitchen, and primary illumination and the most used space
within the cabin. Farming, gardening, play, bathing, waste disposal
and laundering were outside activities which kept the
cabin's
residents outdoors most of the daylight hours. Most food storage, a
significant portion of the food preparation, and virtually all waste
disposal took place outside. Of these the most likely to be marked by
direct, significant, attributable archeological remains are waste
disposal, food storage and gardening, the latter to include non-crop
plants.
Solid waste disposal and toilet activities provide reasons for
satellite features.
The disposal of garbage waste was not much of a
factor since pigs were surely present. More than forty are included
in the 1863 Harrison probate inventory. Solid waste of a non-organic

materials kept throwaways to a minimum. Broken crockery and other
ceramic items are the obvious exception. At the individual farmstead

WALLING CABIN

In the last half of the nineteenth century the expansion of farm

of railway service, advancements in the
production of items, particularly machine production, and the spread
of advertising combined to distribute goods in such quantities that
the solid waste problem was accelerated.
Containers, in particular
glass, ceramic and metal, were to move from reuse until broken status
to throwaways and become the major components of the trash dump.
The
nineteenth century mail order catalog dates from Benjamin Franklin's
1744 promotion of his Pennsylvania fireplaces but the business really
hit its stride when the railroad network achieved a high level of
rural seivice.
T.J. Walling and family would have had much less access to such
goods than would those who occupied the cabin subsequently. His
departure from the area in 1859 predates the railroad serving the area
and the manufacturing techniques of many bulk produced items. Much
the same situation applies to the Harrison family, gone from the
premises by 1867 at the latest. Dump sites frequently were features
which had previously seen other use. Wells, pr1v1es, root cellars,
and vegetable kilns were quite often converted to such use after
having served their original purpose. It is worth emphasizing that
this secondary use, with the exception of the privy, by virtue of its
being secondary, lowers the possibility of early
trash
being
deposited.
Privies are an exception since they often served their
primary purpose and were simultaneously a place for discard.
In
response to the outside-the-dwelling activity of solid waste disposal
and concurrently that of toilet needs the farmstead undoubtedly had a
succession of privys and, later, a series of trash disposal features.
No feature identified as a privy was located at the site even
though the cabin never had indoor plumbing during its entire history.
Informants familiar with the 1920s farmstead (P. Young 1982, B. Young
1982 and Beery 1982) and with the 1940s circumstances (Green 1982,
White 1982, Hale 1982 and Faulkner 1982) were able to place the
general privy locations for each of these eras but no surface evidence
pinpointed the specific locations.
It is probable that
these
locations have been disturbed by subsequent agricultural activity in
the area adjacent to the cabin 11 yard 11 • The locations recalled were to
the northwest and downslope from the cabin and its associftted
features. The downslope location is to be expected in order to
minimize possible health hazards resulting from subsurface water
drainage; however earlier, less well informed generations often opted
for convenience in placing the outhouse location, sometimes at
considerable peril to their health (McDaniel 1982:162).
Above ground food storage, in the absence of refrigeration and
ready access to ice, takes the form of drying, smoking, pickling and
salting, as appropriate, the food to be preserved. It is then stored
in an environment which retards spoilage. Given the considerable
number of hogs shown in the 1863 Harrison estate probate inventory and
the one hundred fifty pounds of pork also listed there is every reason
to believe a meat storage facility existed.
If not a separate
building, it was probably an area within a multi-purpose building.

CABIN FARMSTEAD

Since storage on the hoof, or transportation on the hoof, represents
the obvious means of minimizing problems, the area need not have been
large. No evidence of the former presence of such a facility was
found. Once again it is possible that all traces had been obscured by
subsequent argricultural activity. A 1920s photograph of the cabin
(Figure 13), supplied by Mr. Preston Young, shows a shed or small barn

in a area not now identifiable as the farmyard. Two of the children
pictured in the foreground are among the informants contributing eye
witness data to this report, Bonnie Young (Price), right, and Nadine
Beery (Young) second from right. Another photograph from the same era
and source shows a post and rail fence, now not in evidence, located
beyond the shed or barn and running approximately north-south
indicating that the farmyard once extended at least that far.
Underground storage was another pre-refrigeration method widely
employed, mostly for vegetable and root foods. Its purpose was to
limit the temperature range and control moisture in the hope that the
roots and vegetables would neither rot nor sprout. In practice, given
sufficient time, the stored items did both, but to a lesser extent and
more slowly than if stored otherwise. The more common term for such a
facility is root cellar. The cellar, whether a root cellar, storm
cellar, coal cellar, or any other type, was usually not located
beneath the house but near it. For ease in entry, hillsides were
preferred locations (Halstead 1881:224, Allen 1852:306). As would be
expected, a wide variation exists in root cellar configurations due to
topographic location, construction tailored to accomodate the quantity
of food to be stored, and the type of materials ava.ilable to construct
the cellar. It is sometimes difficult to identify a root cellar with
certainty from its remains unless it has been well preserved. This is
particularly true if the facility was primarily an earth excavation
with minimum use of wood , perhaps for bracing and possibly for a door
or cover. This type, so small that actual entry by the users was not
possible nor necessary, was underground storage at its most basic
level.
One researcher, working in Maryland on farmsteads generally
contemporary with the Walling Cabin, found these root/vegetable
storage facilities were termed 11 vegetable kilns 11 by his informants
(McDaniel 1982:154-155). The term seems most appropriate. It is this
type of underground food storage facility which is located northeast
of the cabin.
The details of its excavation and recording are
included in the Excavations section of this report. Excavation
revealed its size and shape to be appropriate to a vegetable kiln.
Together with its topographic context and position with respect to the
cabin, this information gave credence to labeling it a root cellar
(vegetable kiln) during the initial survey. Mr. Young was able to
furnish confirmation that the feature was indeed a root cellar in use
(or still in use) in the 1920s when he lived in the cabin (P. Young
1982). Excavation also revealed secondary use as a trash receptacle
and an
artifact complement consistent, where dateable, with
Mr. Young's information.

WALLING CABIN

An outdoor activity of extreme importance to those living on a
farmstead in any era but particularly in a time when circumstances
demanded a greater degree of self sufficiency than the present time,
is gardening.
Gardening, as used here, refers primarily to the
kitchen garden, an area where plant foods were grown not as cash crops
but specifically for home use.
A farm family might make use of a
portion of the cash crop or crops but variety in diet and the bulk of
that diet came from the kitchen garden. For convenience the kitchen
garden was usually located close to the dwelling and was a true family
project,
all
family
members
including
very young children
particip~ting in its tending.
The remnants of a kitchen garden are
located to the southwest of the Walling Cabin. Since most of its
vegetable components were annuals no trace of them is seen in current
vegetation.
Fortunately such gardens were not limited to vegetables.
Flowers, herbs and certain trees were often included and, to the
extent that perennial types were planted, a relict garden persists.
The former Walling Cabin garden showed iris, marigolds, fig trees, and
an apple tree.
Iris, in bloom during the survey when the cabin was
identified, extended in an irregular line from the garden area in a
pattern indicating they had once lined a path to the cabin and also
that branch of the path extending south to the entrance to the
property from the county road. The fruit trees present do not have
the girth to reach back to the early years of the farm but they may
well have grown from seeds produced by trees planted during those
years and not now present. The 1920s photograph of the cabin (Figure
13) shows a large tree in front of the second cabin pen which was
absent during the survey, emphasizing the degree of vegetational
change.
A larger than usual Bois d 1 Arc tree stood south of the cabin at
the fenceline of the property. This species, more properly called
Osage Orange, is here within its native range (Winberry 1979:135) but
not in its natural context. Its preferred habitat is along stream
bottomlands. Thus, its presence at the fenceline is at least open to
speculation.
Starting in the early 1840s, the Osage Orange was
actively promoted as a living fence (Winberry 1979:136-139). Its use
as a fence spread the species well out of its natural range, becoming
by the 1870s the predominant fencing material in
Kansas
and
responsible for significant percentages of fencing in Illinois, Iowa
and Missouri, as well as its native Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and
Louisiana.
It had by that time seen major use in most of the
southeastern states and successful use was reported in New York,
Delaware, Pennsylvania and Maryland (USDA 1872:497-512). At the peak
of its popularity it was rapidly supplanted by barbed wire when bulk
manufacture of that type fencing began in the early 1870s (Winberry
1979:138, Glover 1980:1). Many Osage Orange trees were converted to
fence posts for the new wire. The Walling Cabin tree has barbed wire
enveloped to a depth of almost five inches in its trunk.
The
considerably larger than average girth and height of this particular
tree (its diameter at eye level was 46 inches and its Allen level
measured height 71 feet) marks it as a long time resident since 11 it is
a relatively small tree, usually growing to heights of 10 to 15 feet 11
(Winberry 1979:134, Steyermark 1963:563, USDA 1907:1) although larger

specimens have been noted. The Walling Cabin Osage Orange is probably
a botanical artifact of the earlier years of the farmstead's
existence.
Fencing, introduced not only to keep stock contained but to keep
the stock out of the crops, is an omnipresent part of any farmstead.
The relative ease with which fencing can be adjusted to partition off
a desired land segment allows for a great many possible changes since
the initial occupation of the Walling farmstead. However, since the
property line fronting on the county road to the south has been the
property boundary from i nit i a 1 land grant to the present, it is likely
that the fenceline has been positioned along it from the first. As
mentioned above, at least a part of the farmyard was post and rail
fenced
and the Osage Orange tree was probably a deliberately
positioned fence element. A barbed wire fence is now in place.
Barbed wire within this fence includes several twentieth century
patented types and two earlier types, Baker Perfect Flat Barb patented
1883 and a Glidden type barb patented 1874 (Glover 1980:72). The
Baker Barb is the type which is enveloped by the Osage Orange tree.
Laundering, bathing, kitchen gardening and possibly some food
storage require a regular water source. Much later than the Walling
occupancy this need was partially met by the two now dry wells to the
northeast of the cabin. No evidence of an earlier well was found but
an informant, Mr. P. Young, spoke of a nearby flowing spring which
served as the major water source during the 1920s. His observations
were confirmed by several other informants.
The presence of this
spring, though not flowing at the time the cabin was investigated (see
Environment), and Wasson Branch Creek about a third of a mile distant,
provide the water sources. Informants told of Mr. Green, owner since
1939, having directed the spring flow through his horse troughs in the
1940s.
A similar earlier arrangement may have provided a de facto
spring house for food storage.
In summary, the remnant components of the early Walling farmstead
are the dwelling, a kitchen garden, a vegetable kiln and a fenceline.
By inference there must have been a toilet facility, above ground food
storage, a barn or shed and possibly a spring house for food storage
and watering needs.

LOG CABIN CONSTRUCTION
Introduction
HISTORY AND AMERICAN ANTECEDENTS
The log cabin, storied birthplace of presidents, frontiersmen,
backwoodsmen and folk heroes, is regarded by many Americans as a
peculiarly American phenomenon. The log cabin, more specifically log
construction, as practiced in the New World, has European origins, is
more ancient than we can yet trace and was more often than not more a
dwelling construction of expediency than one of choice. Many of its
inhabitants would have elected other living quarters
if the
opportunity
had existed.
Failing that opportunity, many cabin
dwellers altered their homes using non-log construction means as soon
as this was possible.
Marcus Vitruvius Pollio, a Roman architect and engineer writing
in the first century B.C., describes log construction of houses in
sufficient detail to identify it as the
log-on-log
alternate
logs-at-right angles method (Morgan 1914:39; Mercer 1976:3). Though
Vitruvius 1 is the earliest clear description thus far known, most
authorities place log construction origin a great deal further back
into antiquity, possibly as far as the Mesolithic (Jordan 1978:21).
There is good evidence that by Medieval times log construction was
practiced in Norway, Sweden, Finland, European Russia,
Poland,
Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, the Alpine countries and the German Black
Forest (Jordan 1978:21). By the time the New World was colonized each
of these areas had a long tradition of log construction, many of them
including techniques closely associated with a geographic area and its
peoples.
At this point in history - colonization of the New World agreement among log construction researchers begins to diverge as to
which peoples from which geographic areas provide the antecedents to
the American log structure. Cases have been made for virtually every
possible source.
Henry C. Mercer, in an oft-reprinted paper read before the Bucks
County
(Pennsylvania) Historical Society in 1924, came to the
conclusions that "leaving the case of Canada as yet in doubt, the art
of log construction was introduced into North America . . . in New
York or Virginia or New England, not in the form of dwellings but of
forts or so-called 'block houses'.
That log dwellings, as
known to the Swedes and Finns in their native home land, were
introduced by them a few years later in the Delaware valley. 11 (Mercer
1924:30-31). Harold R. Shurtleff, while working with the Williamsburg
restoral project, conducted a great deal of research aimed at
disproving the idea that log dwellings were among the first houses in

54

WALLING CABIN

the early colonies.
His book, The Log Cabin Myth, published from a
draft manuscript after Shurtleff's death, made a distinction between
blockhouses, jails and communal use buildings and houses and gave

findings, never finalized by himself and without his having the
opportunity to defend them, have been used by subsequent researchers
to "prove" or 11 di sprove 11 whatever point is in question.
Some
researchers will not allow the small Swedish colony sufficient
influence to effect the spread of log construction throughout much of
North America (Weslager 1969:197-201). Others find Finnish influence
among the Swedes to be of paramount importance (Jordan 1983:93;
Many invoke German and Scotch-Irish emigrant
Langsner 1982:11).
arrival as the pivotal factor in log building use and diffusion
(Weslager 1969:206-234; Langsner 1982:12; Glassie 1963:8).
Warren
Roberts discusses similarities and differences between Scandinavian
log houses and those in America and arrives at the overall conclusion
that there is little resemblance (1976:445) while Terry Jordan reaches
an opposing conclusion.
"Some elements of Midland American log
architecture and carpentry are likely Fenna-Scandian in origin"
(Jordan 1983:93). General agreement appears to be unattainable and
unnecessary.
The point is that a whole host of possible European
sources exist and it appears that most if not all of them had
contributed to the American log building by the time the architectural
type had reached full flower. In sum, the American log cabin is a
hybrid of European techniques for using wood material representing the
most practical means of obtaining shelter under frontier conditions.
EAST TEXAS AND THE LOG CABIN
The log structures erected by the early settlers of East Texas
have their stylistic and technological antecedents in those geographic
areas from which these settlers emigrated. At the end of the American
Revolution the ancestors of the bulk of those people who would settle
East Texas lived in the piedmont of Virginia and the Carolinas.
From
these
locations these people, their children and grandchildren
followed three fluid and overlapping streams westward to Texas.
The
more northern stream ran westward from Virginia to the Ohio River
valley, first into Kentucky and Ohio, then onward to Indiana, Illinois
and Missouri.
People of this migrational stream, usually second or
third generation, became Texas settlers from Kentucky, Missouri,
Indiana and Illinois.
A middle stream, from North Carolina and
southern Virginia, moved into Tennessee and onward into Missouri and
Arkansas.
This surge, spreading north and south as well as west
brought nearly all the Texas settlers from Tennessee and contrib~ted
to those from Missouri, Arkansas, Kentucky, Alabama and Mississippi.
A southernmost stream from Virginia, North and South Carolina,
predominantly the latter two, took the Gulf states route through

influx of immigrants accounted for more than half of the arriving
families by 1850 (Lathrop 1949:51).

The Rusk County sector of Texas by the mid-nineteenth century was
culturally and economically linked to what has been termed the Lower
South, generally the geographic areas within
the
southernmost
immigration stream including the colonial core area. This was chiefly
due to the large scale influx of lower southerners into Texas

Nacogdoches was the focus of unorganized (in

colonial core, areally southeastern

Maryland, Delaware and New Jersey, was settled by people from the
Germanic states or the Scotch-Irish with smaller numbers of English,
Welsh and Scandinavians (Mitchell 1979:151; Jordan 1983:59-61). The
Wallings and the areas into which they chain-migrated into Texas were,
as far as log construction heritage is concerned, exposed to the
German, Fenna-Swedish, and Scotch-Irish influences on that craft.
Most authorities
credit these
three groups, with the major
contributions to the American log house (Langsner 1982:11-12;
Jordan
1978:24 and 1983:93; McRaven 1978:18-19, Shurtleff 1939:213-214)
The East Texas log house or cabin of the age of the Walling
Cabin, should, in view of the foregoing, reflect features and
techniques stemming from the Upper South cultural lineage and its
European antecedent cultures. As each increment of its construction
is examined in this report the origin of that log building tradition
will be cited where established.
In order to have a basis for
comparison of the Walling Cabin with other log buildings in the area
it is appropriate to cite the characteristics most often recorded by
previous researchers. To that end data from the records of the Texas
Log Cabin Register (TLCR), North Texas State University, will be used.
The data in the files of the TLCR is the most extensive available. An
example of the form used to add the Walling Cabin to that data base is
included in Appendix 1.
Details of the Walling Cabin
THE WOOD
East Texas has what must have seemed to its early Anglo settlers
an almost endless supply of timber. The would-be cabin builder could
select a wood suited to the planned use.
Because of its ready
availability in the area, oak is the local primary choice for use when
resistance to heavy stress
is
needed.
For those
building
circumstances less demanding, pine, a softer, more easily worked wood,
was desirable. In East Texas, the area of the Piney Woods, sheer
quantity makes pine the popular choice although cedar, elm, cottonwood
and gum have all been used (TLCR files). The Walling Cabin makes use
of oak, pine and cedar.

WALLING CABIN

LOG SIZE
The basic factors involved in selecting log size are the physical
dimensions of the tree stock, practicality and cultural heritage with
respect to house size.
In East Texas both oak and pine grow to heights of 80 feet or
more with girths exceeding 3 feet (Little 1980:287, 297, 382-410). On
the practical side, the prepared log should be a reasonable load to
handle;
manual labor was the dominant force used to work and place
them. The front sill of the Walling Cabin (an oak log) required seven
men to pick it up and place it on a trailer when the cabin was
relocated. Another practical consideration is that the original room,
pen, was heated by a single fireplace. The space adequately heated is
limited by the size and heat reflecting characteristics of the
fireplace and imposes a climate keyed limitation on room size.
The cultural factor involved in log length is the traditional
house size heritage of the builder. Most of the pioneers who settled
in East Texas prior to Texas
independence were
of mixed
English/Scotch-Irish stock and had been in America long enough to be
influenced by both traditions. The traditional English peasant house
was a simple square (Bealer 1978:23), roughly sixteen feet on a side.
The Scotch-Irish tradition was a rectangular house shape, usually
sixteen by twenty feet (Bealer 1978:24).
The Walling Cabin is a
rectangle twenty feet six inches by eighteen feet six inches - in this
respect following the Scotch-Irish tradition.
Except for the sill logs on which everything else rests, the need
for strength and the consequent use of oak is offset by the lighter
weight and easier workability of pine. Pine, then, is the logical
choice for wall logs and this choice was made by the Walling Cabin's
builders.
Once log length has been set, the next step in wood preparation
is to shape the logs as desired. This was, in pioneer times, nearly
always done prior to erecting the basic structure (McRaven 1978:103;
Jordan 1978:36). The basic processes involved are scoring, hewing and
notching.
Scoring is the process of cutting into the log surface at short
intervals, usually ten to sixteen inches (Figure 14b). This is done
with an ordinary axe, sometimes called a felling axe because it is
also used to fell the trees. This type of axe, the best of which have
a poll, an American invention, is distinctly different from the
broadaxe (Figure 14a) or hewing axe. The scoring cuts serve as the
guides and first step in reducing the raw log to the desired size and
shape.
Hewing is the process of removing a set portion of the log to
achieve the desired shape and dimensions (Figure 14c). The log is
usually marked by snapping against it a chalked string temporarily
attached to its ends, and hewing takes place 11 to the line 11 , a phrase

LOG CONSTRUCTION

57

which has entered the language.
The outermost portion may be
accomplished with the felling axe, but the final hewing and in most
cases all of the hewing was accomplished using a broadaxe (Figure 14c
and 14d). The blade size, blade edge, handle curve, and weight of the
broadaxe are all designs specifically developed in Germany, to meet
hewing needs.
(Bealer 1976:30). The broadaxe was not used for tree
felling and is ill suited for such use for the very characteristics
which make it an efficient hewing tool.
After hewing, the log may be as 11 smoothed 11 as the builder
desires.· A good broadaxe wielder can smooth a log to remarkable
tolerances. Further smoothing can be done with and adze. The adze, a
tool with the blade edge perpendicular to the handle in the manner of
a hoe, is in effect a large, heavy chisel with a handle. Its edge is,
like that of the broadaxe, basiled on one side, toward the handle
(Figure lOa) (Bealer 1980:117). The marks left on wood from the use
of an adze are very like those left by a broadaxe and differences are
usually difficult to ascertain; the use of an adze is probably not
indicated unless nearly all trace of the scoring marks have been
removed. Adzing is a dangerous undertaking for all but the most
skillful since the user stands on the log being smoothed and swings
the tool so as to create an even plane of the wood below the adzman's
foot.
Imprecise use guarantees injury to the foot. The broadaxe's
handle curve and the position of the user beside the log is much
safer.
The use of an adze in the construction the Walling Cabin is
doubtful.
After hewing is complete, the log has been brought to a cross
section thought suitable by the builder. These cross sectional types
are termed rough hewn, square hewn, planked, half log and hewn half
log
(Figure 15).
Obviously there are gradations between some
categories, particularly rough hewn and planked. The square hewn log
requires the most work, and is the least common of the aforementioned
types. It is found most often in sill and plate logs, those at the
bottom and top of a wall respectively (Jordan 1978:36). Planked logs
are culturally linked with the Upper South and would be expected of
immigrants from that area.
East Texas examples of planking, rough
hewn, square hewn and half log cross sections exist along with some,
generally late, unhewn log use. Planking is the most common cross
section found in Texas (Jordan 1978:36).
Notching is the process of shaping the log ends to fit them
together sequentially in adjacent walls.
It is the key to log
construction since the entire weight of the building, except the
bottom (sill) logs and the floor, rests on the corners and therefore
the notches. The notching also holds the walls in place laterally,
resisting horizontal movement.
Jordan finds eight distinct corner
notch types in Texas (Jordan 1978:49). Four of these account for the
overwhelming majority of Texas' log structures.
These are the
half-dovetail, square, 11 V11 and saddle (Figure 15).
Together they
aggregate 95.1% of the 698 structures recorded up to 1978. The
Walling Cabin corner notching is square, the type which appears in 152
TLCR file recordings. It is the second most-used house corner notch

type found in Texas and the third most-used type when outbuildings are
included (Jordan 1978:51).
Square notching accounts for at least a
third of the TLCR listed structures in Rusk, Nacogdoches, and nine
other East Texas counties (Jordan 1978:69).
The square notch is
attributed by Jordan to areas settled largely by persons of English
stock derived from eastern Virginia, an attribution with which Glassie
agrees (Jordan 1978:68, Glassie 1963:5-14). It must be noted that the
square notch corner, alone among the four major notch types in Texas,
is not self locking. Lateral movement of the sides of the structure
toward the center of the pen is restricted by the notch but no such
restriction exists for movement outward from the center. In order to
insure survival of the structure, square notched construction is
usually nailed or pegged at the corners. The Walling Cabin is neither
nailed nor pegged, giving credence to at least a partial weather board

cover lest friction be the
Preparation of the weather boards, floor boards, and roof shakes would
have begun long before log preparation in order to allow seasoning to
take place before construction.
Shrinkage of any of these before
being set in place in the structure is desirable in order to avoid
serious roof leaks, uneven, gapped floors, and siding gaps. The
shakes and weather boards would have been split from cedar logs and
riven to shape. Splitting and riving tools were the pole axe, wedges
or gluts, the froe, the maul, and an improvised clamp called a brake.
The pit saw or cross cut saw would have been used to cut the logs to
the length desired and to provide flat ends to log sections cut.
Splitting a log into boards is a tradition common to the
backgrounds of virtually all of the European derived settlers.
Probably the first really organized industry in the 17th century
British colony of Virginia was the splitting of weather boards for
export to England (Bealer 1976:32).
Splitting is accomplished by
driving a metal wedge or a hard wood wedge called a glut into the log
end in such a manner as to cause the wood to separate.
In a 1960 1 s
demonstration for the compilers of the first Foxfire books, a log four
feet in diameter and sawn to a two foot length was split into sixty
four 11 bolts 11 or boards (Wigginton 1972:45-47). The heartwood was not
used. From this example, it is plain that not many trees were
required to produce weather boards or floor boards for a single cabin
pen.
In making shakes, the bolts are further split (riven) to
approximately half inch thickness using the froe, maul, and brake.
Shingles are made from shorter log lengths, with lesser diameters, and
riven to a thickness of about half that of a shake. Some authorities
differentiate shakes from shingles on the basis of the former being
split or riven and the latter sawn or cut (McRaven 1978:130). This
distinction is by no means universally held at present or in the past,
references to riven shingles are common (Sloane 1964:30). There is
general agreement that shakes are larger in every dimension than
shingles.

LOG CONSTRUCTION

61

Riving is accomplished by first clamping the bolt to be riven in
the brake, setting the froe in place and hammering it down into the
bolt. The froe, (Figure 16a) a tool with a sharp wedge-shaped blade
and a perpendicular handle at one end, is twisted by its handle to
split the wood it has been driven into (Figure 16c). The riving maul
is a club-like mallet of hardwood (Figure 16b) and is made from that
material as a matter of replacement economy, safety and to lessen wear
on the froe. The use of a metal sledge to drive the froe would invite
metal fragments flying off on impact, mushroom the froe blade, and
increase the recoil experienced. The pioneers rarely pounded metal on
metal and a parallel to the froe/maul combination is the use of the
wooden glut wedge with the pole axe.
Wood preparation for cabin construction is fully accomplished
when a supply of green logs have been scored, hewn and notched, and a
supply of seasoned weather boards, floor boards, and shakes or
shingles have been split and riven.
The Construction of Walling Cabin
FOUNDATION
The cabin was set on sandstone piers, two or three stones high
and laid dry masonry style, that is, without mortar to hold the piers
together. The practice of raising houses on piers can be traced to
the Tidewater region of Virginia (Jordan 1978:32). Reasons advanced
for so raising the houses range from the belief that this would
protect the wood from termites to that it would permit better air
circulation, to that it helps keep domestic animals out of the house.
As a practical matter it did serve to keep moisture, and therefore
rot, from the logs, since they were not in contact with the ground.
Jordan
finds
a close correlation in Texas between low stone
foundations and settlement by persons from Tennessee, Kentucky,
Missouri and Arkansas (Jordan 1978:32). In this respect the cabin
produced by the Tennessee Wallings follows the TLCR data base.
The
dry masonry character of the piers, essential to the stability of the
structure, indirectly attests to the chimney construction material and
method by pointing up the absence of mortar.
Sill, Wall, and Plate Logs
The sill logs, those lowest on the front and back walls of the
pen, resting directly on the foundation piers, are of oak (Figure 17).
These have been scored, hewed, and half notched.
The half notch
(Figure 15) is employed since there is no lower log with which a mesh
is required. The logs have been hewed to a squared cross section.
The wall logs, those stacked vertically above the sills exclusive
of the topmost logs parallel to them, show scoring and hewing tool
marks.
Their close fit in the front and rear walls and the
contrasting lack of such a fit in the side walls has been previously
noted (see The Cabin Farmstead). Those in the front, rear, and east

difference is unknown. The inside surface of some of the west wall's
logs have been raggedly chopped, probably with an axe. The reason for
this appears to be a subsequent to original construction attempt to
make the wall profile more nearly vertical preparatory to nailing
vertical furring strips.
These in turn supported a partial wall of
machine sawn boards framing the fireplace, but not, as can be seen in
Figure 11, extending to the top of the wall. The furring strips are
circular saw products and extend into the large original fireplace
opening. The nails holding these strips and the board remnants to the
logs are modern, round, wire nails. It is therefore probable that the
axe work, furring strips and inner wall boards are linked to the
constructon of the latest brick chimney which did not fill the
original fireplace/chimney opening and was erected after 1939.
The plate logs, those which top the non-gabled walls and provide
the support for the rafters, are planked and square notched. Unlike
most plate logs, they are not hardwood oak but pine as are the wall
logs.
The topmost, gable end wall logs are square hewn and half
notched. Surprisingly, they were not pegged or nailed to the plate
logs, despite the non-locking character of the notch type used. This
supplies even more evidence of the immediate use of weather boards on
the gable walls since something was needed to hold the plate logs in
position countering the pressure of the rafters supporting the roof's
weight.
The plate logs show no sign of mortising to support the
rafters. A nailer board for notched rafters is attached to the rear
plate, the front plate as found is too deteriorated to· provide any
information on this joinery.
The presence of 'the nailer board,
attached with modern round nails, indicates a significant re-roofing,
to include at least some of the rafters, has taken place (Figure 19).
OPENINGS IN THE LOG WALLS
Door, window, and firplace openings in log buildings are cut from
the log pen after it is erected (Jordan 1978:43; McRaven 1978:36;
Wigginton 1972:101; Bealer 1978:43). It is easier to maintain both
wall alignment and corner notch fit by using wooden wedges to hold the
logs in place near the edges of the aperture to be cut in the log pen
than to construct and true the walls using short sections of logs
which do not span the entire wall length. The cutting of any opening
weakens the structure, so these were held to a minimum and sized
accordingly.
THE DOORS
The three doors present in the cabin as found are not original.
The centered front drior was a part of the original coftstruction but
those in the rear, north wall and the west, side wall are additions to
the original pen.

WALLING CABIN

The rear door allows access to a shed room which, from its
materials, construction method, fastener type, and tool use marks, is
an addition made several decades later than the construction of the
original pen.
The mounting of the door and the provisions for
latching it show it swung into the log pen. This would be a waste of
floor space not likely to be engaged in when it could have been
avoided by having the door swing outward when there was no shed room.
There are no hinge or latch marks to show the door was ever attached
to swing outward from the log pen.
The tool marks on the logs flanking the west, side wall door
indicate it was once a window. The occupants enlarged this window to
allow access to the north-south dog trot hall which connected the log
pen to the frame pen constructed at a later date and now evidenced
only in the 1920s photograph (Figure 13). Because of the weakening
effect of an aperture cut it is probable that the window which
preceeded the door was itself a later alteration to the cabin.
The
common use of wall space for hanging storage and the fact that this
wall lies furthest from the cabin's heat source both lend credence to
the window being a later alteration.
After the dog trot and
additional pen were added, this wall was no longer an exterior one and
was braced by connections made to the new pen, compensating in part
·for the heating and structural strength problems.
THE WINDOWS
In addition to the window/door in the west side wall, there are
three other window apertures. Two of them, those in the front wall
flanking the door in a symmetric manner, appear to be early if not
original features of the cabin. The fact that there are two of them
located in balanced symmetry on each side of the door is a triumph of
cultural heritage and a sense of aesthetics over practicality and
structural integrity. Either one, alone, would have been sufficient
to allow outside light without opening the door and their placement
with regard to each other and the door isn't the optimum arrangement
for cross ventilation.
The absence of both logs which formed the
lintels of these windows hinders a confident statement of the original
vertical dimension, which may have been smaller when first cut. The
presence of hand-sized cuts in the logs just beneath the window sills
at either side of the bottom of each window indicates that prior to
the installation of double hung windows and tacked on screens, the
window covering and closure was by top hinged shutters which swung out
away from the sill and were propped open (Figure 20). The presence of
these hand holes is evidence that this cabin wall was not covered with
weather boards, at least not from the start. The window frame remains
in the cabin as found are those installed to support six light over
six light double hung windows, as seen in Figure 21, an enlargement of
a 1924 photograph showing one of our informants, Bonnie Young. The
installation of these windows made the hand holes unnecessary and, as
can be seen in Figure 21, there is a weather board covering their
location in 1924.

WALLING CABIN

SLEEPERS
The floor joists, called sleepers, are the beams which support
the floor boards. These are normally laid front-to-back from sill log
to sill log since this is usually the shorter dimension of the
structure.
The sills are the lowest logs in the structure. The pine
log sleepers in the Walling Cabin follow the above pattern, lying
north-south.
Spacing
between
sleepers
is
about
two feet,
center-to-center, and the interval between the end sleepers and the
lowest .side wall logs is approximately two feet three inches. All
sleepers are original cabin components. They are rough hewn, almost
to the point of being unhewn, in cross section. The ends are half
notched but the depth of the notching approaches two thirds of the log

decay resulted from prolonged contact with the ground after the
sleepers had come loose from the front sill log. Since the sleepers
only rested upon the sills and were not mortise pocketed into them,
sideways movement under stress was possible, however, it is more
probable that decay, accelerated by the loss of the roof's protection,
caused the load-bearing notches to give way.
FLOORING
That the original construction of the Walling Cabin included a
wood floor resting on the sleepers is apparent although no floorboards
clearly identifiable as being from that era were found. The elevation
of the cabin on piers makes flooring essential and thereby allows
several inferences. Cabins with sills on the ground and dirt floors
were the dwellings of poor folks (dirt poor) or were intended as
Wood
temporary shelter until something more suitable could be built.
floors had an advanced social conotation over dirt ones and were among
the first improvements made to log dwellings when the financial
situation would allow them. The use of wood floors in a construction
method such as the pier elevation/sleeper mode, which does not permit
their later addition to the structure shows a certain degree of
financial solvency, a commitment to some degree
of
structure
permanence and the availability of seasoned wood sufficient to supply
flooring. The evidence is not absolute but it appears that a supply
of seasoned wood planks, sufficient to provide flooring and weather
boards for two sides of the cabin, was brought from the Walling's
previous home in Nacogdoches County.
The type of wood and its
preparation other than seasoning is purely speculative except that
pine is both plentiful and easily worked and the dimensions had to
include at least one length of two feet based on the sleeper
intervals.
The flooring in the cabin as found was a replacement.
It
consisted of circular sawn boards of irregular length and with only a
generally uniform thickness and a planed, dressed, surface. They are
mostly the product of lumberyard milling, not sawmill rough cutting
and hand tool shaping. Those remaining in place were held down by
modern wire nails.
The circular saw marks, planed surface, milled

dimensions and the use of wire

all
attest
to
their
non-originality in view of the 1841 construction of the Walling Cabin.
JOISTS
No ceiling/loft joists of an original construction character are
evidenced in the Walling Cabin. The significance of this circumstance
is twofold. First, no sleeping loft existed as was common to the
period. Jordan remarks, 11 Even the smallest single-story cabin usually
has at least an open, half-attic sleeping loft for children (Jordan
1978:133).
Secondly, the lack of a sleeping loft or loft storage
indicates further buildings, either as additions or as separate
structures, at an early date. The Wallings, with four children when
the cabin was built and five more born while in residence there, would
seem to have had need of a loft or a alternative place to sleep them
all. Since the 1867 rental agreement between Catherine Harrison and
B.C. Oberthier (Figure 5) refers to 11 houses formerly occupied by T.J.
Walling 11 , the building of at least one more house is evident by the
1859 sale of the property to Harrison. However, this reference can be
satisfied, at least the use of the plural can be explained, by noting
that the 1860 U.S. census shows the Harrisons owning one slave house
(Schedule 2:77) and the 1850 census showing T.J. Walling owning five
slaves (Schedule 2:357). On balance it would appear that the lack of
a loft when a need existed is best explained by additions to the
cabin.
Ceiling/loft joists were found in the cabin which are later
additions (Figure 19).
One of these, in the center of the pen, had
been crudely mortised into the first log below the rear plate log and
rested on the log below that one. It is milled lumber with circular
saw marks. Its presence is more easily attributed to first use as the
support for a temporary room partition and secondary use as a loft
joist at a later date. The other joists rested, (none were in place
when the cabin was found) on a nailer plank spiked to the second log
below the plate, giving them the same height as the single mortised
joist. All of these joists have modern, round, wire nails in them and
all show power drill holes spaced such that prior use in aother
capacity is inferred. The amount of compression damage at the ends of
the several smaller sized joists indicateJ a significant load-bearing
role when in place. It appears a loft was once present, covering the
west side of the pen, at a time following the local availability of
lumberyard dressed lumber, wire nails and spikes, and the use of
undercut lumber. The nails alone, by their type, would place this
occurence no earlier than the late 1880's and more probably it took
place several decades later (Nelson 1963:3; Swank 1892:448-451).
FIREPLACE AND CHIMNEY
The base of the fireplace and chimney of the Walling Cabin is
irregularly shaped tabular sandstone laid in the dry masonry fashion
without mortar. Atop this were a few handmade, low fired, molded
bricks
laid with mortar (Figure 22).
These bricks show edge
mushrooming and cupping produced by removal from the mold.

considerble heat. This confirms that the bricks' position in the
chimney during use was the same as that in which they were found
during this investigation. On top of the few hand made bricks and
interleaved with them in the first course began a chimney made from a
modern wire cut, pressed, branded brick (Figure 22b). The brand name,
Cole, and a distinctive mark indicating the brick is union made
identify this chimney as being a Corsicana based company product made
no earlier than the 1930's. An informant recalls the construction of
this chimney as having taken place after 1939 (Green 1982).
The hand made brick measures 8 1/2 in by 3 3/4 in by 2 7/8 in,
which does not compare well to any twentieth century standard type
size (McKee 1980:53; Brick Institute of America 1975:1).
The South
Formula number (see glossary) would be 121, within his 115-130 range
for pre-twentieth century American brick (South 1964:67-74).
The
machine produced, Cole brand brick measures, by contrast 8 by 3 3/4 by
2 3/8 in, a Standard category unit designation for twentieth century
non-modular brick.
This produces a South formula 113, right in the
center of his lli-114 twentieth century range (South 1964:71).
The
utility of this formula for dating brick is subject to question
especially when employed without a considerable local data base.
It
is included here chiefly as an addition to an East Texas data base now
being compiled.
The post-1939 fireplace reflects the necessities of the times.
Since
the
fireplace was then no longer the chief source of
illumination nor the focus of cooking activities,.the new fireplace is
nowhere near as large as the original, and the scaling down applies to
the chimney at least to the height of the firebox (Figure 23).
The
space surrounding the new facility was boarded over on the outide and
inide. The brickwork in the new chimney/fireplace was not laid in
conformance with any standard bonding method. Whole bricks and bats
(brick fragments) have been used. The first three courses above the

Bricks were placed in either
header or strecher position but not in a pattern and without regard to
joint sealing course to course (Figure 23). As a result the brickwork
_was in the process of falling apart.
The original chimney could have been constructed cat style, or
from stone, or from brick but the evidence is in favor of a catted
chimney on a stone base.
The use of stone for the entire chimney is not indicated since
the stone piers on which the house rests and the stone chimney base
are of undressed dry-masonry-laid stone. It would be illogical to lay
a unmortared stone base for a mortared chimney column for such a
structure would be unstable and soon collapse.

must have a base dimension of considerable proportions relative to
their height and the stone is dressed to fit and usually size
graduated with the largest stones at the base. The stones at the base
of the chimney in this case are relatively small and are lacking any
evidence of dressing to fit.
Further, a dry masonry constructed
chimney of undressed stone would have required the chinking of spaces
between stones to make the chimney draw.
In sum, a stone chimney
under the circumstances is an impractical, labor heavy, inefficient
and unstable choice and can be ruled out without supporting evidence.
The lack of mortar in the chimney base and house piers cited
above rules out an original brick chimney. Unmortared brick for such
a structure as a chimney just isn 1 t within probability limits.
Brick
availabil1ty in the general vicinity was poor at best in 1841 and
bricklayers were also scarce (see The Cabin Farmstead).
Availability
of both increases significantly after the 1843 founding of the nearby
city of Henderson, making a brick replacement chimney feasible within
a few years after the cabin 1 s construction.
A cat chimney, one constructed from mud and sticks on a pole
framework, with a stone firebox liner and base, is the most likely
choice for the cabin's first such structure. TLCR records and early
accounts show such chimneys present in East Texas and specifically in
Rusk and Nacogdoches counties (Jordan 1978:97).
One of Jordan 1 s
11
11
typical profiles
for cat chimneys in Texas matches the original
chimney opening profile of the Walling Cabin very well (Jordan
1978:97).
Cat chimney construction technique is much the same as
11
wattle and daub 11 construction. Glassie has the method attributed to
England, Wales, and Ireland and being carried over to New England and
the seaboard South during the colonial period (Glassie 1963:113).
To
this lineage Jordan adds Germany, Sweden, and northern France and the
opinion that the American cat chimney was probably introduced by the
Scotch-Irish (Jordan 1978:98). The method, in view of the foregoing,
is within the cultural background of the Walling Cabin's builders.
Cat chimneys, while easy to build from readily
available
materials, have several drawbacks. Connor states the case well: 11 Cat
chimneys were not satisfactoy, they smoked, usually drew poorly and
were a constant fire hazard yet they were built for years in East
Texas 11 (Connor 1949:114). The only thing he lef~ out was that they
required frequent replastering with mud since rain quickly disolved
that portion of the chimney. Chimney daubing was an East Texas fact
of
life
for
a
long time (Overstreet 1975:77-81;
Fillingim
1973:15-16).
In sum, a cat chimney is a part of the appropriate cultural
tradition, can be easily made from locally available materials, is
compatible with the known chimney base, and supplies ample reason for
early 'brick replacement.
The rains would do away with part of the
materials from the replaced structure, and the rest could be burned as
fuel in the new structure, leaving only the stones at the base as
evidence. It is, of course, a matter of speculation when the cat
chimney was replaced by the hand made brick chimney, however an early

date is likely and not just for reasons inherent in cat construction
and maintenence.
Cat chimneys bear some of the same social stigma
attached to dirt floors and bare log exteriors. The Wallings avoided
such flooring and applied weather board, in part, from the first, and
it is therefore reasonable to speculate that the first brick chimney
was constructed as soon as materials, means, and expertise permitted.
THE ROOF
Roof remains attributable to the original construction are
scarce.
The ruined and largely collapsed roof over the log pen is
not, in the main, original. The remains show a side-facing gable type
structure with four different roofing materials present.
Riven
shakes, sawn wooden shingles, asphalt shingles and corrugated tinned
steel were found (Figure 24). In one case fragments of all four were
found skewered by the same nail.
Roofing appears to have been a
continuing process of layering the new over the old. The 1924 photo
shows an intact asphalt shingle roof covering the original pen, the
dogtrot, and the adjacent frame pen (Figure 13). The tin (corrugated
By the time

mitigation efforts began the roof remnant was as shown in Figure 24
with respect to the log pen. There was no ridge pole.
The rafters,
unmortised or lap-jointed, were simply angled to a peak at their
juncture and nailed together. In one case a triangular wood brace was
nailed to the roof peak rafter joint (Figure 24). The roof pitch over
this section was an Abney level measured 45 degrees. The rafters are
not notched or mortised into the plate logs but are nailed to a milled
wood plank in turn nailed to those logs. The arrangement is much less
sturdy than it could have been and undoubtedly contributed to the
roof's collapse. All the remaining rafters are milled wood and appear
to be replacements. It appears they may have been inserted, lathing
nailed across them and the shakes and shingles nailed on or renailed
on to the new support. Nails recovered from the roofing material and
rafters are, without exception, modern types being either round wire
nails, special purpose roofing nails or washered ~etal roofing nails.
The option this presents is the reroofing of the cabin circa 1890 by
removing the shakes and reusing a part of them together with wooden
shingles, and a later reroofing of the cabin and additions which
involved only the covering material.
Although both composition
shingle and corrugated galvanized iron were primarily nineteenth
century innovations in roofing, neither had seen much use beyond the
eastern seaboard until late in the century (Waite 1976:143, 146).
Composition shingles were made by the "build up" process in which
cloth, felt or paper impregnated with a tar like substance were nailed
to the roof, then coated with more of the viscous substance. Oftimes
several layers were put down and the process completed with a coat of
sand or gravel (Waite 1976:144-145). The Walling Cabin shingles are
factory produced sheet composition shingles wherein the whole of the
shingle itself is factory produced, base to sand layer, and is
installed on the roof as a unit.
This
construction method
corroborates the nail type evidence in placing the composition
reroofing later than 1890, and probably well into the twentieth
century.

ADDITIONS TO THE BASIC CABIN

•

Present at the time the cabin was investigated were a shed room
at the rear of the original pen and what appeared to be a
west-side-attached shed room.
The latter, from
the
informant
interviews and the 1924 photograph, turns out to be a dog-trot hall
which lay between the log pen and a later frame construction pen
(Figs.
13, 24, 25). No evidence of the frame pen remained. Indeed,

identification of the dog trot hall as a side shed room. All
additions are constructed of materials which show tool marks, fastener
use and construction methods which mark them as not being part of the
original building. Occasional square cross section, cut nails appear
in the rear shed room but reuse cannot be ruled out. None were found
in a usage which precludes reuse. The nail hole patterns indicate
much of the material in the rear shed room had seen previous use or
had to be refixed in position. It was noted that weather boards are
affixed to the rear wall of the log pen which became the wall in
common with the shed room. Though this could have been a cosmetic
maneuver, this wall was composed of well fitted, closely abutted, logs
and little gain accrues in terms of either privacy or appearance.
A
more likely scenario is the covering of the back wall of the cabin,
and probably the front, as soon as more seasoned weather boards were
available, in an event preceeding the addition of the shed room.
The dog trot hall, as can be seen in Figure 25, was so little
represented in the remains that only the most general remarks can be
made concerning it. The flooring remains are of milled lumber.
The
nail complement is of the modern, round wire variety. The only
significant features remaining are evidence of a pegged mortise joint
where the hall roof support joins the log pen roof support and a half
notched, nailed joint where an extension to the front sill log was
joined to it.
No tangible evidence was found of the front porch shown in the
1924 photo (Figure 21). As in the case of the frame pen and much of
the dog trot hall, the porch had left no obvious trace (Figure 25).
It is probable that the construction materials found on the surface of
the relict kitchen garden represent the remains of these additions.

THE METAL DETECTOR SURVEY RESULTS
The metal detector survey had three purposes.
First,
an
experiment to allow comparison of. its results with the locations of
those artifacts observed during the visual surface search was
conducted prior to any excavation. Secondly, the instrument was used
to corroborate opinion as to those areas under the cabin most likely
to provide the greater density of artifactual material. Finally, the
detector
provided a
foreknowledge
of
the
presence
of
response-producing material immediately in advance of hand excavation.
The extent and general patterning of the surface scatter is shown
in Figure 4.
As caveats to the pattern shown it should be recalled
that the former presence of the frame pen was unsuspected at the time
of the surface search. That former presence no doubt contributes to
the west lobe of concentraton. Equally unknown at the time was the
former presence of a shed or small barn now known only from the 1920's
photograph (Figure 13). That presence may furnish partial rationale
for the east lobe of artifact concentration. Against the pattern
produced by surface search, the metal detector-produced pattern shows
a great measure of correlation (Figure 4). The density of metal
detector hits is much greater than the surface artifact count but the
areas in which they occur are much the same. The density difference
expressed numerically would be misleading since surface artifacts come
from all preserved materials while those represented by detector hits
only represent metallic objects.
Further, the buried
artifact
component of the whole artifact array is a function of the efficiency
of those processes causing burial and the time they have been
operative.
The more important results are the correlation of the two
search means with respect to location and the indication that a rather
unimpressive surface scatter· is underlain by a rather more dense
subsurface artifact array. This circumstance, produced in 140 years,
with about 100 years of actual occupation, encourages a closer look at
similar home sites with relatively small surface scatters and offers
the opportunity for guiding the selection of shovel testing points at
such locales.
The detector was employed under the cabin and its immediately
adjacent areas.
The density of hits noted added emphasis to the
selection of the hearth and original front entrance areas for hand
excavation.
While
this
information, being corroborative, not
contrary, did not alter the decision to excavate in these two
locations,
it did
lessen the chance for missing significant
concentrations of metallic artifacts and associated material.
Had a
significant, dense, hit concentration occurred elsewhere, additional
excavation, at least shovel testing, would have been employed.
There
may be a concentration of non-metallic artifacts undetected in the
unexcavated areas under the cabin;
however, such a concentration

METAL DETECTOR SURVEY

81

would, in any case, have gone undetected, given the less than full
areal excavation. In sum, the use of the detector added emphasis to
the reasons for selecting the hearth and original entrance for
excavation (See Excavation Beneath the Cabin) and supplied a degree of
confidence that unexcavated areas would be less artifact productive.
During the conduct of excavations in the hearth and entrance
locations, the detector provided an early warning of the presence of
artifactual material. It is possible, but not certain, that the
caution which forwarning produces in the excavator may have lessened
possible damage to the more delicate items recovered since a decision
to switch from a trowel to a bamboo probe or a brush can be made
without visual evidence of an artifact's presence. Additionally, the
detector was useful in providing post-excavtion indications that no
metallic artifacts still lay unexcavated below the depth at which
apparently sterile soil had been reached.

THE EXCAVATIONS
GENERAL
Two excavation schemes were employed. Backhoe trenching was used
to determine the identification and character of the features which
were outliers to the cabin. Hand excavation was employed beneath the
cabin and to assess the character of the root cellar/trash pit deposit
after that backhoe trench revealed a trash deposit.
·
THE LOWER WELL
This feature (See Figure 4) was originally identified as a
possible privy given its location with respect to the well upslope and
the distance from the cabin. The feature was located northwest and
downslope at a distance of about 69 feet from the west door of the
cabin. The area was brush and shrub overgrown, shaded by an oak tree,
and had undergone considerable collapse of its walls, such that little
evidence of its former shape or function remained.
Prior to brush
clearing and excavation, it resembled the entrance to the den of a
moderately sized burrowing animal, its cultural origin clued only by
its location.
A backhoe trench cut on an east-west axis revealed a shallow, dry
excavation having a slightly bell shaped cross section. There was a
cone shaped mound in the center of the excavation composed of earth
fallen from the upper wall. No evidence of a casing or masonry was
found. Removal of the center cone of earth provided no artifacts, nor
were there any at bottom of the feature. The feature appeared to be a

characteristics made it appear older than the obvious well located
upslope from it. That well is concrete sheathed in part and is topped
by a wood well curb and the remains of a windlass. None of the
materials used show great age;
all indicate twentieth century
construction.
The upper well is only 11.6 m deep and was dry. Its
position upslope places the bottom of this well within a few feet of
the same stratum as that of the lower well, a circumstance requiring
the sinking of a shaft through approximately 20 feet of additional
material to attain. The only apparent advatage of digging a new well
upslope, that the water source is approximately 31 feet closer to the
cabin, does not appear to outweigh the effort required to dig it.
Further, if the lower well went dry, why try to reach water at a
greater depth by starting upslope where more soil must be dug through?
No fully adequate answer was found, but the later origin of the upper
well was confirmed by informants, the Youngs, who lived on the
premises in the 1920s and recall the lower well in operation and,
incidentally, as not being a very good well (P. Young 1982). A
possible answer may lie in postulating mechanical well digging
equipment being available to a twentieth centry cabin occupant, thus

THE EXCAVATIONS

83

allowing a somewhat more convenient well to be dug to a level still
producing water in the lower well.
In any event, the excavated
feature was a well and proved empty of atifacts.

THE ROOT CELLAR
This feature was located north-northwest and downslope from the
west cabin door at a distance of 39 ft 4 in. Its appearance,
undisturbed, was that of a small thicket featuring a few moderately
sized ·fig trees, greenbriars and small shrubs surrounding an ovoid
central depression. A north-south oriented backhoe trench was dug
across the east end of the depression and an intersecting east-west
trench dug westward from the first trench through the depression,
forming a T-shaped excavation. In this manner, the stratigraphy could
be observed in two directions in contiguous trench walls.
Artifacts
and the stratification revealed by the trenches showed the remains of
a probable root cellar, subsequently used for trash disposal, an
identification later confirmed by informants (Mr. and Mrs. P. Young
1982). The west wall face of the north-south trench and the north
face of the east-west trench were trowel cleaned, recorded, profiled
and photographed. There was evidence of a fire, in the form of a
charcoal stratum, which occurred prior to the use of the feature as a
trash disposal location.
The cleaned wall faces showed the outline of the cellar, more
accurately called a vegetable kiln, into the C horizon of the soil
profile.
B horizon fill ejected during
this
excavation
was
identifiable in reverse stratigraphic position of the A horizon
stratum. Twentieth century artifacts, whole and fragmentary, were
found unstratified on the ground surface and stratified in the leaf
litter stratum and B horizon. Figure 26 shows the profiles recorded
for this feature. Table 2 provides stratigraphic descriptions.
The cultural modifications
of
the
trench
profiles
are
demonstrated by several features observable in the profiles. The
clearest evidence of a former excavation is of a layer of the light
reddish brown pebbly clay B horizon lying in reverse stratigraphic
position atop the A horizon in both the north and west profiles. This
is initial evidence that excavation had taken place at this site in
the past. At some point in time later than the first excavation, the
B horizon spoil dirt in the north profile slumped back into the root
cellar fill, leaving what is now an indistinct boundary with the
cellar fill.
In the west profile, the spoil dirt sits distinctly
above the A horizon and has broken into large chunks. The A horizon
is discontinuous across both profiles, having its most regular and
natural appearance in the west profile, were it attains a thickness of
about 40 cm. In the north profile, the A horizon is divided into two
segments. Along the eastern portion of the profile, the A horizon is
an irregular lens, a maximum of 25 cm thick. It overlies the B
horizon and partially underlies the leaf litter stratum.
In the
western portion of the profile, the A horizon forms a very thin
stratum sandwiched between the cellar spoil dirt and the B horizon,
and pinches out at the contact between the spoil dirt and B horizon.

and

The leaf litter stratum occupies the lowest point of the surface
depression and consists of a coarse leafy mulch with bottle, jar,
sheet metal and wire artifacts worked through it.
The leaf litter
overlies cellar spoil dirt, B horizon, and A horizon fill, all in the
north profile.
The B horizon is continuous throughout both profiles
and
constitutes the thickest stratum in the profile, varying from 75 cm to
a meter in thickness. The B horizon is culturally sterile in the west
profile but highly artifactual in parts of the north profile. The B
horizon forms a transitional, indistinct boundary with the underlying
C horizon in the natural case, as seen in the west profile, but this
is not the case in the north profile. There the B horizon at one
point forms a vertical face with the C horizon and dips down into the
C horizon. This dipping indicates clearly were the cellar was dug
into the earth.
At the bottom of this lowered B horizon is the
charcoal stratum which lies along what was at one time the floor of
the cellar.
The charcoal stratum is basically B horizon fill mixed
with numerous charcoal chunks to such a degree that the mixed
materials form a distinct, observable stratum. This stratum and the
plentiful charcoal chunks in the B horizon above the stratum are the
basis for the inference that the cellar burned. Cultural materials
other than charcoal are plentiful in the B horizon in the cellar fill,
including glass, nails, china, procelain, sheet metal, a boot heel and
the hood and grillwork of an old automobile. Cultural debris appears
not to extend west along the north profile farther than an imaginary
line extended vertically from the vertical face between the B and C
horizons to the contact between the cellar spoil dirt and the B
horizon. Artifacts in the B horizon extend east to the juncture of
the north profile and the west profile, but not along the west
profile. From this evidence, it is inferred that the eastern boundary
of the cellar was probably near the intersection of the two trenches.
The C horizon is a red brown compact clay with yellow clay lenses
within it.
The stratum is culturally sterile and lies below the
solum. The cellar was dug aproximately 25 cm into the C horizon,
however, and the clay formed the floor of the cellar. After the use
and burning of the cellar, artifactual pebbly clay B horizon material
filled the cellar, in effect thickening the B horizon at the expense
of the C horizon.
It is possible that the charcoal resulted from the burning of
trash in the former root cellar/vegetable kiln. However, the feature
was in use as a vegetable storage facility during the 1920s according
to some former residents, the Youngs, thus the artifacts lost to such
an episode would be of comparatively recent vintage.
The artifacts
recovered during excavation, some of which are described later in this
report, include no items attributable to an era earlier than the
1930s.

early twentieth-century manganese decolorizing use was
present. The artifact array is in concert with the information
supplied by the Youngs.
In summary, the root cellar/vegetable. kiln trenches demonstrate
the presence of a former root cellar by spoil dirt from excavation, a
discontinuous A horizon, and below that an artifactual B horizon and a
vertical face where the cellar was dug into the C horizon. Evidence
of burning of the root cellar is found in a charcoal stratum lying
along the floor of the root cellar. Evidence of post-burning trash
dumping exists in the form of numerous artifacts exhibiting no fire
damage in the cellar fill, in the leaf litter zone and on the surface
of the cellar depression.
THE "FOUNDATION STONES" TRENCH
Northeast of the vegetable kiln and north northwest of the cabin,
downslope from both at a distance of 69 feet lay four ironstone rocks
of the same type as those used for the cabin's foundation piers.
Their alignment as found was not such that a building foundation was
suggested, but the relocation of one stone would provide a rectangular
shape if each stone was then regarded as a corner. The resulting
rectangle would be the size of a moderate shed. No surface indication
of such a building was apparent in the vegetation, by disruption of
the soil surface, or in the presence of surface artifacts.
No
indication of a path or former path led to or very near these stones.
Despite the limited evidence for a feature's presence, the relative
ease with which backhoe trenching can be accomplished when available
led to a decision to trench.
An east-west oriented trench opened in alignment with the
conjectured building's long axis and a north-south "T 11 extended north
from that trench. No subsurface evidence of soil disturbance was
apparent and the total artifact recovery was four earthenware ceramic
sherds, which may have originated in a single vessel, and a ceramic
insulator fragment. Excavation was abandoned at the C horizon clay.
Ironically, the conjectured shed did exist and the stones were
foundation piers.
Informants identified the location as that of the
chicken coop in the 1920s (P. Young, B. Young 1982).

THE DEPRESSION BEHIND THE HOUSE
A very shallow depression, roughly rectangular with an east-west
long axis of about 4 feet and a short north-south axis of about 2
feet, was located to the north of the house and behind it.

proximity to the house, 6 meters (about 19 feet), dictated it be test
trenched though surface evidence of any prior use or function was
lacking.. Accordingly, an east-west trench was excavated through the
long axis, commencing and terminating outside the depression limits in
hopes that an identification of the feature could be made. The 01
horizon and the A horizon produced two glass fragments, fifteen
ceramic sherds, two brick fragments, two pieces of plastic, a 12 gauge
shotgun shell casing, a porcelain fragment once part of a doll, and a
company logo imprinted, oval badge from an automobile (See Artifacts
Descriptions). No attributions of earlier than twentieth century
vintage could be made. Further, the artifact array was not confined
to the depression but was more or less spread along the course of the
excavation.
The close proximity of this location to the house places
it well within the range of sheet refuse which would be expected.
Also, its location in fair alignment with the rear entrance to the dog
trot portion of the house when both pens were in use makes the area
one having seen frequent use.
The excavation showed no significant disturbance to the A soil
horizon at the apparent edges of the depression. The organic heavy 01
horizon was slightly more narrow than outside the depression and this
difference accounts for virtually the entire depth of the depression
itself. No reason for the existence of this feature could be
identified.
It may be simply a compaction of the ground surface
resulting from a recent agriculture-related activity, since the cabin
was used most recently to store fertilizers, pesticides and melons
awaiting transportation to market.
THE GARDEN AREA
The relict garden located southwest of the cabin and extending
along the county road fenceline contained construction material
scatter. Bricks, brick fragments, wood fragments, and a small amount
of modern sheet refuse were in evidence. Within the garden area (See
Figures 4 and 9) lay an oval-shaped area with an oak tree at one end
which was outlined on the surface with small tree branch sections and
a few stones. The dimensions of the oval so resembled a grave that
this appearance coupled with the obviously deliberate outlining
dictated an exploratory trench. Accordingly, a shallow trench was
excavated with close examination following each increment of dirt
removed. No evidence of soil color, texture or composition change was
found within the oval as compared to that without. No stratigraphic
anomaly showed in the excavation wall and no artifacts were present.
The excavation was terminated at the clay C horizon, it being obvious
that the soil was undisturbed and no grave or other feature was
present.
No ready explanation for the surface outlining of the area
was apparent but excavation elimated the possibility of an associated
subsurface feature.

It included the under-cabin area immediately below the room sector in
which the greatest amount and variety of activities took place. The
hearth was the sole early heat source, the main illumination source,
and the primary food preparation area. In addition, this excavation,
having as its east boundary the
chimney
foundation,
allowed
examination of the base of that feature. Further, a metal detector
sweep of the under-cabin area showed a greater concentration of major
signals, indicative of larger buried metallic items, than all but one
similarly sized area. That area, in the vicinity of the cabin's
original front door, was also selected for excavation (see below).
Prior to excavation the square was arbitrarily divided into
excavation zones, an east zone where pinpoint metal detection would be
attempted and a west zone where it would not. Within the east zone,
all significant 11 hits", strong signals indicative of metallic object
presence, were marked using stake wire flags. The purposes of this
procedure were:
1.

To gather information on what types of metal objects create
significant signals in terms of size, shape, metal type and
orientation.

2.

To examine the signal producing effects, where possible, of
multiple small metal objects versus those of larger single
metal objects.

3.

To determine the accuracy of stake wire flag
relative to an inidividual item's actual location.

4.

To note the non-metallic items in close proximity to the
detected metallic items, those materials which would be
recovered along with such a metallic item as a direct result
of digging for the latter.

placement

In order to address the questions stated above each flagged
location within the east zone was collected and bagged separately.
The area originally attributed to each of the eleven hits flagged was
a cylinder with an 8 in diameter with the flag as its center and a
depth extending down to artifact-sterile soil. The results are shown
in Table 3. Concentrations of relatively small metallic items such as
nails and small caliber cartridge cases produced signficant (high

sound volume and large meter indicator needle deflection) signals.
Artifact orientation was, in every case, with the long axis parallel
to the ground surface. Items detected were most often within 4 inches
of the stake wire flag base. The presence of non-metallic artifacts
within the area which would be excavated in recovering the detected
items was expected, and is recorded in Table 3 to document the
collateral benefits of metal detector usage.
One metal detector hit could not be pinpointed as the very strong
signal appeared to have no focal point, covering an east-west distance
of almost 50 cm and having indistinct north-south
boundaries.
Excavation at this area hit resulted in the recovery of a large iron
object measuring 17.5 by 1.75 by 1 in. This object, which appears to
be a fragment of a light capacity vehicle leaf spring, is badly rusted
and deteriorated. It is broken off at the point of a 3/8 inch round
hole which in similar springs represents one of the points of
attachment, the one in the object's center connecting the spring to
the vehicle's axle assembly.
This would indicate the item was
originally about 36 inches long allowing for some deterioration loss.
A quantity of metallic and non-metallic material was found around this
object and, along with the object's size, accounts for the detection
signal charac~eristics (See Table 3).
Except for the collecting and recording procedures stated above,
the hearth square was excavated by hand. A thin, 1/16 to 1/8 inch 01
horizon of humic matter, wood chips and undecomposed vegetable matter
covered the A soil horizon. This 01 horizon included recognizable
seeds from watermelon, pumpkin, and bottle gourd. A few artifacts of
indeterminant provenience were recovered (See Artifact Descriptions).
The dismantling of the cabin made difficult an accurate recording of
their positions after removal of the collapsed floor, sleeper logs,
roof fragments and accompanying debris.
The A soil horizon was a weakly developed
and
loosely
consolidated sandy loam.
It was found to have a maximum depth of 4
inches with an undulating contact with the 8 horizon, sometimes no
more than 2 inches from the surface.
B horizon is a highly
consolidated red clay which, at a depth of 6 inches from the surface,
is sterile with regard to artifact content. The subsurface artifact
assemblage was in a narrow vertical niche from the surface through the
variable A horizon and penetrating slightly into the B horizon clay.
A minor disruption of the soil column had occurred at the south border
of the square where a broken sleeper log had come to rest and begun to
decompose.
Hearth square excavation produced 170 artifacts or fragments
therof in a condition allowing at least minimal attribution and 84
metal fragments so highly deteriorated that identification beyond
11
metal fragment" was impossible. Nails predominate, there being Ill
whole or partial specimens. Buttons (7), ammunition components (6)
and marbles (2) were present and represent classes for analysis
offering date attribution possibilities (See Artifact Descriptions).
No item was recovered which is definitely attributable to the cabin's

earliest occupants.
An examination of the base of the chimney and the hearth 1 s
construction was conducted during this excavation and the results
recorded (see Fireplace and Chimney). Excavation was terminated when
the B horizon clay proved artifact barren beyond its uppermost 2
inches and the bottom of the chimney base had been reached at a depth
of 10 inches from the pre-excavation surface.
THE DOOR SQUARE EXCAVATION
As previously stated, this excavation was undertaken as an area
offering enhanced early artifact recovery possibilities due to high
use, and as an area which had produced a high incidence of signals
when swept with a metal detector.
As the cabin 1 s original main
entrance, high occupant use was assured. As an added advantage, the
addition of the front porch (See Figure 13) with its dog trot located
steps, covered the early entrance and changed the manner in which the
building was entered.
As a result, the earlier deposited artifacts
had some degree of protection from disturbance and it was reasoned
that a lesser quantity of modern additions to the artifact complement
would be found than would be the C@se without the porch addition.
The 2 by 2 m area to be excavated was aligned with magnetic north
and positioned so as to include the area lying immediately beneath the
entrance sill and extending north slightly into the area beneath the
cabin room.
The southern portion of the square extended 9 1/2 to 10
inches outside the sill line. The ground surface was superficially
disturbed by the cabin 1 s dismantling and the milling of cattle
pastured on the property.
The metal detector exercise used in the instance of the hearth
square excavation was not repeated.
The detector was used to
establish metal presence forewarnings but no separate collection or
recording procedures were employed since the points regarding detector
use had already been addressed.
Excavation was conducted by natural level in view of the results
from the previously excavated hearth square. The 01 horizon was less
prominent in this instance owing to the unprotected location of most
of the square outside the structure. The A horizon loam was 4 inches
(10 cm) in depth at the northeast corner baulk and graded to veneer
status near the southwest corner. The clay B horizon was compacted to
a point of near hard pan where it lies outside the former structure 1 s
protective cover and the A horizon thins. A soft spot next to the
southeast corner was the result of an ant 1 s nest and lay beneath two
field stones comparable to those used in the cabin 1 s support.
Excavation was again conducted to a depth of 8 inches although the
artifact bearing strata was for all practical purposes the A horizon
with a few items at the A-8 juncture.

WALLING CABIN

The artifacts recovered from this excavation square totalled 378
of which 212 were whole or fragmentary nails. Ninety-three artifacts
were within the area formerly within the cabin and 285 outside those
confines. These figures, when the difference in square area excavated
is considered, produce no significant difference in artifact density
between the interior and exterior areas. Analysis possibilities other
than nails were presented by buttons (2), marbles (2), and ammunition
components (2).
No specific intact artifact could be attributed to
the cabin's earliest occupants.

ARTIFACT DESCRIPTIONS
AMMUNITION
Twenty three artifacts fall into this category. Among them are
nine complete rounds or cartridges (primer, case, and bullet), eight
whole or partial cases, and six pieces of shot. Table 4 provides the
characteristics of these specimens.
Ammunition is not easy to categorize and most descriptions
contain too few· characteristics. Caliber is not enough since almost
every caliber has many variations in rim type, case length and shape,
primer type (firing means) and bullet weight and shape. Rims are
typed rimmed, semi-rimmed, rimless, rebated and belted in the United
States (see glossary for these and other ammunition terms). Cases may
be straight or bottlenecked and come in several lengths. Primers may
be rim fire or centerfire and in the latter case Berdan primed or
Boxer primed.
Bullets come in a huge variety of· shapes.
The
importance of these differences is that some variants have distinct
not-earlier-than dates and therefore, diagnostic value. Caliber alone
may even be misleading since there is no universally accepted system
of designation. For example, the popular rifle round .30-06, in
bullet size, is no different from any .30 caliber bullet. The -06 is
the date of origin, 1906, and describes the original powder load, not
the bullet. A .357 magnum bullet is actually .357 inches in size but
a .32 caliber bullet ranges from .301 inches to .313 inches in
diameter and a .45 caliber bullet from .452 to .454 inches, depending
on who made them.
Shotgun shells are very difficult to tie to a particular period
useful in a Texas archeological context.
Pinfire ammunition was
patented in 1836 and is still manufactured.
Centerfire, commercial,
self-contained ammunition was on the market in 1851. Front-loading
and breech-loading weapons sold side by side well into the twentieth
century.
The huge number of varieties produced, combinations of
gauge, shot size, shell length and powd@r load, is well over 6,000
types, most of them not very limited as to years of manufacture. The
best approach to analysis is through
the
manufacturing
firm
information on the shell base, or, if present, the case. Secondarily,
a gauge no longer manufactured in the U.S. may be diagnostic .
. 22 Caliber Short
The .22 caliber short cartridge is the
oldest American,
commercial, self-contained, metallic cartridge. It was introduced in
1857 and is still loaded and used all over the world. Virtually every
company that makes firearms produces a model which will chamber the

.22 short (Barnes 1972:69). Accordingly, unless the firm producing
the round had itself only a limited time in business and the firm's
mark is visible on the case, these rounds have limited use as
diagnostics.
Three rounds were recovered, all of them complete. Two
are marked Peters HV (high velocity). These can be purchased today
and have been available since 1930, the date marking the first use of
high velocity power loads (Barnes 1972:273). Both were surface finds.
The third "short 11 is marked F, the mark of the Federal Company, and is
also a non-diagnostic mark .
. 22 Caliber Long/Long Rifle
The .22 Long and Long
Rifle
ammunition
types
can
be
differentiated only when the cartridge is complete. The case is the
same for both, but the .22 Long Rifle bullet is larger. The .22 Long
usually shares the same bullet size as the .22 Short, 29 grams, while
the .22 Long Rifle bullet is either 40 grams or, if hollow point, 37
grams. At first look, the .22 Long appears to be a combination of the
.22 Short and the .22 Long Rifle case, a combination allowing a larger
powder load on the small bullet. Actually, the .22 Long was invented
at least 16 years prior to the 1887 invention of the Long Rifle round
(Barnes 1972:274). Thus, the .22 Long Rifle is actually the addition
of a larger bullet to the 22 Long cartridge case (and powderload).
The resulting combination is more accurate in its firing than the .22
Long.
Three complete .22 Long Rifle rounds and one complete .22 Long
round were recovered.
All these were surface finds. Two .22 Long
Rifle rounds have the hollow point, 37 grain bullet and one has the
solid 40 grain bullet.
The firm markings 11 U11 and 11 H" each appear
twice. These are used by the Remington Company and the Winchester
Company respectively, and furnish little in the way of diagnostic
information since both firms have been in business so long and are
still extant.
To complicate matters, 11 U11 was originally the mark of
the Union Metallic Cartridge Company which merged with Remington in
the 1880s. Remington continues to use the mark to the present.
Three .22 Long or .22 Long Rifle cartridge cases were recovered.
Unfortunately, all were highly deteriorated.
No mark could be
distinguished on two of these cases, the two recovered. from the
excavation squares. The third case, an under-cabin surface find after
the dismantling has a diamond mark which has eluded tracing.
All .22 caliber cartridges are rimmed and rim fired.
Both
characteristics are inventions preceeding the Civil War in commercial
availability and both are still in use .
. 25 caliber
The single .25 caliber cartridge, complete, recovered is a pistol
load on the basis of its case size. The round is semi-rimmed, center
fired, and the bullet is copper jacketed.

recently deposited item .
. 38 Caliber
Four cartridge cases of this category were found, all of them
fragmentary.
All are center fired and semi-rimmed. Case shape and
length are unavailable in three specimens due to their poor condition;
however, the markings on two specimens identify them as a .38 Short
and a .38 Long, both of which would have had a straight sided case.
Case length would be 0.70 inches in the former and 1.03 inches in the
latter.· The .38 Long case is marked U.M.C. for Union Metallic
Cartridge Company and the .38 Short case is a Winchester product.
U.M.C. products appear under that designation, despite the earlier
merger with Remington, in the 1894-5 Montgomery Ward & Co. catalog
(1894:456-461), but have given way to other Remington marks by the
publication of the 1927 Sears, Roebuck catalog (1927:509). The poor
condition of these cases and their subsurface provenience indicates
early twentieth century deposition. Singly and as a group they are
more heavily corroded and deteriorated than any other cartridge cases
found except the diamond marked .22 Long/Long Rifle case .
. 45 Caliber
A single cartridge in this category was recovered. It is rimless
and straight cased. It is center primed and has a bullet .452 inches
in diameter which is copper jacketed. The base is marked Western .45
Auto, identifying the manufacturing firm and the type of loading
mechanism used in the weapon for which it was designed. Although .45
caliber sized rounds have been around for a considerably longer time,
the automatic action
.45 caliber
pistol
dates
from
1905.
Unfortunately, at least from a diagnostic point of view, the .45
caliber automatic pistol, little changed since 1911, was and is the
standard U.S.
Army sidearm. This round could, therefore, be as old
as 78 years, or a very new deposition. As it was a surface find its
provenience offers little insight into its origin. The standard .45
caliber pistol is not a good target weapon or recreational use weapon.
The ammunition is comparatively expensive and the recoil produced by
the firing of the heavy bullet is significant.
Its accuracy at
distances beyond a few dozen feet is comparatively poor. It is a
military-use weapon designed to provide knock-down impact on a human
target at close range without resorting to the expanding slug bullets
outlawed for military use. This specimen, as stated, has a copper
jacketed military type bullet.
Though it is possible that some
individuals within a law enforcement agency might carry such a weapon,
and lost a round in the area, it apears more probable that this
specimen is a souvenir of military service. The tarnished but mostly
non-corroded condition of the round would make World War I a long
shot, World War II an outside possibility, and Korea the. best
candidate.
The abandonment of the cabin as a dwelling prior to Viet
Nam and the limited use of the .45 caliber pistol
in
that
no-front-line type of warfare lessen the possibility of Viet Nam era
origin.

12 gauge
The gauge of a shotgun, the bore size, is a system dating to the
earliest muzzle-loading weapons. Musket sizes were given in terms of
the number of lead balls of a particular size required to weigh a
pound.
A 12 gauge weapon originally had a bore with a diameter which
would admit a round lead ball weighing 1/12 of a pound. At one time
or another gauges l, 2, 4, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 20, 24, 28 and 32 were

were usually mounted on some support and used for market hunting of
waterfowl until such practices were outlawed.
Today American
companies load 10, 12, 16, 20, 28 gauge and .410 inch with the British
still producing 4, 8, 24, 32 gauge and 9mm.
Terminal
U.S.
manufacture date for the 24 and 32 gauges is about 1937 and the 9mm
was loaded by Remington and Winchester until the late 1930s.
The 4
gauge was manufactured in the U.S. until 1905 and self reloading
components until the early 1920s.
The specimen recovered is a 12 gauge, low base, center fired
shell which formerly had cardboard sides.
The base is inscribed
REM-UMC, No. 12, Shurshot. It thereby documents the relationship
between the Remington and Union Metallic Cartridge companies. The
brand name, Shurshot, was in use in the 1930s and still is.
Shot
Shot are distinguished from round ball ammunition on the basis of
size in the smaller varieties (BB and smaller), and on the basis of
the absence of sprue marks and mold marks usually present on round
ball ammunition (See Glossary). Shot, since at least 1782, has been
manufactured by dropping the heated lead from a tower or by methods
imitating that effect (Knight 1882:2165;
Olson 1965:209). Shot
sizes, usually expressed as the number required to weigh an ounce, are
a matter of choice of authority in the smaller categories. Knight
(1882:2165) recognizes this circumstance and lists the figures of two
manufacturers of the late nineteenth century. The BB category is 45
to an ounce and 50 to a ounce in his examples.
Barnes (1972:295)
gives Winchester Arms Company BB 1 s as 50 to an ounce, but earlier in
the same volume shows BB's at 58 to an ounce (Barnes 1972:291).
Fortunately, this sort of confusion doesn't hold for the larger shot.
The six specimens found at the Walling Cabin were all subsurface
recoveries.
None have sprue or mold marks. Measurements of their
diameters (See Table 4) place four of them in the 00 buckshot category
since all are larger than the 0 size .32 inch (8.128 mm) and slightly
less than the 00 size of .33 inch (8.382 mm). Their slightly smaller
than standard size is to be expected of shot which had been fired and
remained for some time exposed to weathering.
The remaining two
specimens show serious impact distortion, preventing categorizing by
diameter measurement. However, their weight would allow 129.5 such
pellets to the pound. Buckshot, 00 size, is listed by every source
consulted as approximately 130 to the pound (Olson 1965:209;
Knight
1882:2166;
Barnes 1972:295).
All six specimens are therfore 00

buckshot. Considering the relatively small area in which they were
found, the hearth excavation square and door excavation square, and
their small number they may all have resulted from a single firing of
a weapon.
MARBLES
Marbles in this hemisphere are pre-Columbian and in the Old World
their use extends well into antiquity (Randall 1971:102). Marbles
were used by the Romans and Greeks. The earliest marbles were stone.
Other source materials are baked and fired clay, glass, wood and
metal. Stone, clay, crockery and glass versions are the materials
which
have been most used.
Wood and metal versions are not
specifically known to have been commercially produced as marbles per
se, depending on how marbles are defined.
Since the Webster's
(Merriam 1977:702) definition is 11 a little ball made of a hard
substance (as glass) and used in various games, 11 the metal ball
bearing-like spheres used in pinball and pachinko games are not

million marbles a year, produce most of that total for purposes other
than games.
Marbles are used in road sign reflectors, oil filters,
graining lithographic plates, costume jewelry, roller bearings, and as
agitators in aerosol spray cans (Ferretti 1973:31). Some pinball
machines use the regular glass marble,
further
blurring
the
definition's adequacy.
Marbles were imported from Holland and Germany to the American
colonies as early as 1740 (Baumann 1970:18)~ These were ground stone
versions. They were at peak export volume in the mid-nineteenth
century, declining from competition with glass, porcelain and clay
versions in the 1870s. Production and export continued until about
1915 (Baumann 1970:19-22). One type of stone marble, those made from
agate, rose quartz and other semi-precious stones, due to their
natural colors and swirls, enjoyed a 1880-1890 peak and are still
produced for a world-wide market (Baumann 1970:22-23). Clay marbles,
both baked and fired types, were imports to this country until 1884,
which saw the first commercial production in America (Weitzman
1976:143).
South Akron, Ohio was the site of the first clay marble
plant. It was to eventually develop an output of 30,000 marbles a day
(Baumann 1970:28).
Crockery and fired clay - glazed and unglazed marbles were also imported, 1840-1850 being a peak pried, and domestic
production began in the 1880s. Montgomery Ward advertises majolica
marbles in its 1894-95 catalog. The date of origin for glass marbles
is unknown, but major production began in Germany after the invention,
in 1846, of a tool called the marble scissors (Baumann 1970:35,86).
Import to America began soon after.
American home production of
hand-made marbles began with the Iowa City Flint Glass Manufacturing
Company
founded
in
1882.
Small glass factories in America
manufactured some hand-made marbles during the last two decades of the
nineteenth century but imports continued to dominate the market. In
1901 the first American semi-automatic glass marble making machine was
set in operation and by 1905 successful competition with foreign

imports was in progress. Improvements which further automated the
process came just prior to World War I and full automation was
achieved in 1926. German competition was virtually eliminated by
domestic manufacture and the onset of the war, never to be resumed for
glass varieties. In recent years, the Japanese have successfully
entered the market.
It is not possible, by non-destructive inspection, to separate
early hand made marbles by country of origin. Attribution is a matter
of probability. In the Walling Cabin context any hand made marble of
stone, baked clay, fired clay or glass might date to the period of
earliest occupancy and if so would be an import. Eight marbles were
recovered (Figure 28), one baked clay, one glazed fired clay, and six
machine made glass varieties (see Table 5). The two hand made marbles
could have been made as late as the period just prior to World War I.
The six glass specimens show no sign of hand manufacturing and are
twentieth century products post dating 1905 and probably 1926.

BUTTONS
The date for the first appearance of buttons is not known.
Though button-like objects appear on early statuary and in paintings,
there is considerable evidence that these were not fasteners but
ornaments (Luscomb 1967:ix). Button afficianados bemoan the lack of
early examples even though the literature from as early as the
seventeenth century mentions them in a decorative context. Functional
buttons began a rise to popularity in the late seventeenth century,
and became the dominant garment fastener by the next century.
Button manufacture began in the Americas as early as 1706 in New
England, but Europe furnished most buttons used in America until late
in the century (Luscomb 1967:ix).
By the first quarter of the
nineteenth century, England, France, Germay and the United States were
in constant competition in the industry and the materials, methods,
and varieties reached astronomical numbers. As a result, there is no
such thing as an all inclusive reference for buttons. Their recorded
history parallels many human histories in that the most decorated,·
most expensive, and most unusual are listed and pictured while the
more common,
less
spectacular items are
not.
Under such
circumstances, the most rewarding analysis of buttons is obtained from
those which show manufacturer's names, depict topical subjects, or
make use of datable materials since supplanted by something more
suitable.
Some information is also available from the button's size
and shape.
Button size (i.e., diameter) is measured in lignes, a French
term.
One ligne is one-fortieth of a inch. Conversion to inches may
be therefore accomplished by multiplying the ligne measurement by
0.025.
For convenience, a button gauge is included in Figure 28,
along with some of the buttons recovered.
Twenty buttons were recovered (Table 6).
Seven are made from
shell, two from bone, six are metal, two are glass, one is porcelain,
and only two are plastic. As such, they represent rather well the
common run of button materials from the later part of the nineteenth
century up to the advent of plastics in the twentieth century. One of
the plastic specimens is bakelite, the substance which laid the
foundation for the plastics industry, and which came on the market in
1909 (Luscomb 1967:19).
Shell buttons are not generally datable. The material, in use
for buttons, precedes the United States as a country and is still in
use at a decreased rate even with the advent of plastics.
Fisheye
pearl buttons appear in the Sears, Roebuck (1927:294, 1939:497)
catalogs for 1927 and 1939/40, and in the Montgomery Ward (1894:80)
catalog for 1894-95. Shell shirt buttons are listed as 16 lignes in
the latter reference, while the former carries that size among others,
but does not state their use. The shell buttons recovered are 16 (4),
15 (1), 20 (1) and 30 (1) lignes. Using the Montgomery Ward reference
we would have five shirt buttons, one dress button (20 lignes), and
one large dress button or underclothing button, probably the former

since it is decorated.
One of the bone buttons, a plain disc with two larger than
average holes, is illustrated in the 1922 Montgomery Ward (1922:319)
catalog right down to the size, 22 lignes. This button style is also
known in vegetable ivory and porcelain and was made for children's
underwear.
The single porcelain button, a 10 ligne miniature, is of the type
commonly associated with infant's clothing. The small size, less than
a quarter inch, all but guarantees that usage.
The two glass buttons, both from the hearth excavation square,
represent the pressed glass manufacturing process. Their 11 in between 11
sizes, 15 and 27 lignes;
colors, red and red with black;
and
non-flat shapes suggest a degree of ornamentation more often found in
women's clothing early in this century. The vividness of the colors
also suggest early twentieth century versus nineteenth century origin
(Luscomb 1967:81). The larger of the two has a self shank (see
Glossary). This allows buttoning through thicker material.
The bakelite button is coat sized, 30 lignes, but beyond that can
only· be attributed to a date later than 1909, since bakelite is still
produced in several variants of the original formula.
The other
plastic button is a 41 ligne giant.
It is two holed, with the
distance between the holes relatively small for so large a button.
The holes are set in a circular recess. It is not surprising that the
section between the two holes is broken. A late date is suggested by
the use of plastic, and the button size suggests a coat.
Three of the buttons made wholly or partially of metal are work
clothes buttons.
Each of these bears some marking. One is white
metal, four holed with the hol~s in an indented center and is
inscribed 11 U.S.A. 11 •
The inscription could not be attributed. A
second, the same size, 23 lignes, also four holed and indented has the
partial inscription 11 8. Co., patented Dec. 9, 1924 11 on the back side.
The front, heavily worn, has traces of black enamel.
The back
inscription is identical with that on a button in the author's type
collection. It is a product of the Patent Button Company which
commenced operation under that name in the 1870s and frequently made
buttons heavily covered with paint (Luscomb 1967:145). The front of
the type collection version bears the inscription "Miller's Ace High 11 •
The specimen recovered is too heavily abraded and the paint too heat
affected to determine whether or not it was also marked.
Two buttons combine other materials with metal.
One is cloth
covered iron.
Rust and decay have rendered it unattributable except
to suggest it was used on a dress or coat, based on size.
A second
combination has a tinned iron base crimped around a domed plastic
center faceted on its inner surface. A flexible shank suggests coat
or dress decorative use in the double breasted style. The flexible
shank allows a non-functional button to lie close to the garment
without dangling and provides a better appearance.

106

WALLING CABIN

Two of the metal buttons are not round. The octagonal button is
badly corroded with indications of copper content. The face has the
remains of a flowing pattern design. The remains of a metal link are
attached to the self shank. Without the additional part it is not
possible to determine whether the other end of the link joined a bar
or another button,
Link buttons are nearly obsolete today but have
been produced since the early eighteenth century (Luscomb 1967:121).
The second button is a work clothes type well known to collectors.
Stamped on a heart shaped planchet is the picture of a streetcar and
the inscription "Union made 11 • The form and picture are the logo of
the Hamilton Carhartt Company which takes full advantage of the
ability to graphically represent the Carhartt name. Carhartt has been
in business since the early twentieth century.
The union reference
marks this example as later than the 1886 formation of the Federation
of Labor. The use of the heart shape is known as early as 1910
(Chamberlain and Miner 1967:173).
In summary, the buttons from the Walling Cabin are those for men,
women and children.
Working clothes, dresses, coats, underwear and
infant wear are represented. In date most are pre-plastic twentieth
century back to at least the last quarter of the nineteenth century.
No very early, datable items were found and post-World War II plastics
are also lacking.
The array corresponds well with the occupational
history of the dwelling.
GLASS
Containers
Twenty five glass containers, whole or nearly so, were recovered.
Twenty two came from the root cellar/trash pit feature. The total is
not significant since continued excavation would have resulted in a
much greater sample had that been desired. Once a determination had
been made that trash deposition had not begun prior to circa 1930, and
the
vertical and horizontal extent of the deposit determined,
excavation of the feature was terminated.
Informants
provided
corroboration of the field findings as to deposition date. While the
TAS team was still on site and further excavation was a viable option,
former residents of the cabin stated the root cellar was still in use
as such in the late 1920s (P. Young 1982). As can be seen in Table 7,
no root cellar specimen indicates to the contrary.
Each whole
container has a datable characteristic placing its manufacture after
1920. Many show later dates and most are still being manufactured.
Of the three specimens found on the surface, the two jars are
unremarkable.
Both could have been deposited within the last twenty
years. The Atlas EDJ seal (Figure 29a) is a true diagnostic and
something of a rarity. It was developed in 1910 by the Hazel Atlas
Company and became the first top seal for the new machine-made Mason
jars (Toulouse 1977:95, 120). The lid was actually developed before
the jar type on which it was most used. It was an attempt to obtain a
jar lip-to-cap seal instead of a jar shoulder-to-cap seal and enjoyed

only partial success until the machine made jar assured a smoother fit
(Toulouse 1977:106).
It was supplanted starting in 1915 by the Kerr
self-sealing assembly which could adapt to slight lip imperfections
and eventually took over more than 90% of the canning market. Neither
closure could function well with the highly imperfect handmade jars
which home canners had by the hundreds of thousands. As a result, the
Atlas EDJ seal was usable with a random few, smooth, handmade jars and
was not as well adapted to the new machine made jars as the Kerr seal
developed only five years later. In addition, the EDJ seal was never
patented and a competitor, the White Crown Cap, was on the market in
the same year. In sum, the EDJ seal, and the White Crown, had a
limited portion of the market for just under five years. It is,
therefore, a good chronological marker.
The glass containers recovered serve to underscore evidence of
the transfer of function from root cellar to trash pit in the 1930s.
The surface finds produced a hard-to-find jar lid type representative
of a transitional period . of home canning methods and indicative of
that activity at the farmstead.
Glass Gemstone
An oval shaped gemstone (Figure 29b) was recovered as a surface
find beneath the cabin pen in the hearth area. The faceting is
twentieth century with a modification (Kraus and Slawson 1947:105).
The table is flat and a culet is lacking which produces 79 facets
instead of the usual 80. The girdle is thick and unfaceted.
The
color is violet-pink and has a Mohs scale hardness greater than 5 but
less than 6.5 .. It will scratch ordinary glass.
The streak is
colorless and the fracture conchoidal.
The combination of the
foregoing eliminates most true gemstones, with the exception of
apatite, in favor of glass.
Unlike most glass imitation gems the
pavilion has not been silvered, foiled, or lacquered.
Inclusions,
including air bubbles, are lacking at lOX magnification, an unusual
circumstance in glass. Examination at 20X shows traces of mold seams
on some pavilion facets and at some points where the pavilion joins
the girdle, eliminating natural stone origin. The stone is pressed
glass, made with iron compounds to produce the color, which has been
subsequently polished to eliminate most mold marks.
It is an
unusually good imitation gem, the cut of which places it's production
in the early twentieth century.
Lamp Bulb
A globe type, glass lamb bulb minus its base, was recovered from
beneath the log pen during the disassembly of the cabin (Figure 29c).
The globe is about 3/4 inch in

diameter.
It is a single filament lamp. Without the base, a choice
between single and double contact cannot be made. The ·diameter size
is appropriate to automobile side and tail light lamps of the 1920s,
and also to single cell lanterns of the same period (Hayward and
others 1927;34;
Montgomery Ward 1922:544).

potential diagnostic value.
Recording was accomplished by noting
color, manufacture means, indicative shape, physical characteristics
and decorations or inscriptions if present. Clear, decolorized, glass
predominated numerically with amber glass a poor second. Blue and
white (opal glass) fragments were present in small quantities as was a
single black glass fragment.
Many fragments showed the effects of
fire induced distortion in both the root cellar/trash pit and the
hearth excavation square.
The buried status of most specimens and
their late date of origin ruled out the use of sun effects on
manganese dioxide decolored glass as a dating means.
Few fragments were usable in terms of use attribution.
A
Moroline patent medicine bottle fragment was identified by matching it
with the whole specimen found. Two canning jar lids (opal glass)
stood out due to their white color and partial inscriptions. A single
panel bottle fragment, fire distorted, was sufficiently whole to place
it in the machine-made category. The jar lid fragments are from Ball
brand zinc cap-glass lid enclosures for machine-made canning jars.
Six pieces of sheet rolled glass, probably window glass, were
recovered. Five were surface finds.
With the exception of the single black glass specimen from the
hearth square, no glass fragments attributable to the nineteenth
century were found. The hearth square produced 34 fragments, the door
square only four and the surface finds totaled eight.

Beare 1965:34).

BARBED WIRE
Patented wire versions of wire fences have been extant since
William H. Meriwether of New Braunfels, Texas obtained one in 1853.
Meriwether's wire was barbless but most of the 457 patented wires that
followed were not.
A deluge of wire patents began in 1867 and
continued for 30 years. Four hundred and fifty four patents were
issued between the end of the War Between the States and the
commencement of the twentieth century. The more popular patents are
known in multiple varieties and about a thousand of these have been
catalogued by various researchers and collectors.
Fortunately for
historical archeological purposes, many varieties are highly localized
geographically while others had a short period of manufacture. Either
circumstance provides a potential diagnostic value in the right
context.
The Walling Cabin farmstead provided six varieties of barbed wire
from within the general area of the structure. Three of these are
variants of George C. Baker's 1883 patent. Two are variants of an
1892 John D. Curtis patent which was issued on the basis of a slight
change made to an 1887 Jacob Haish patent. Curtis' change resulted in
a wire so popular that it is still being manufactured. The final
specimen is a modern version of Joseph F. Glidden's "winner", first
patented in 1874 (Clifton 1970:90-91, 95, 99; Glover 1980:nos. 5, 12,
39, 72; Turner 1966:no. 50; Garlick 1982).
The wire samples taken (Table ·9) are all two strand wires with
two point barbs.
The carrier wire, which carries the barb, is 13
gauge in five of the six specimens.
One specimen makes use of a
larger, 12 gauge, carrier and a smaller, 14 gauge, other wire. Barb
spacing and the number of twists between barbs are presented in Table
9 but it must be noted that these characteristics are a source of
ongoing argument among barbed wire specialists. Interval, some argue,
is a matter of how well and how often a fence segment is tightened and
stretched either by deliberate maintenance or seasonal expansion and
contraction.
If this is the case, specimen 4 is logically older than
specimen 3 since the barb spacing is considerably greater.
Other
specialists think no great amount of stretching occurs between any two
barbs and that the differences are due to the manufacturing process.
The number of twists between barbs is subject to argument also. Wire
is routinely twisted during installation and maintenance as a means of
tightening the fence (Marquis 1976:140).
That this twisting is
uniformly expressed between sets of barbs appears unlikely. Note that
specimen 4 has a half twist more between barbs than specimen 3 yet the
barbs are farther apart. This would call for a wire with a great deal
of ductility to allow such an interval difference in the face of the
shortening effect of a greater number of twists. Such a wire would be
unsuitable for fencing. The number of twists, except in the immediate
area of a splice, would appear to be a product of the manufacturing
process.

Two wire specimens were found deeply imbedded in tree trunks
whose growth had surrounded them (see Table 9). Both imbedded wires
are early
varieties
and their provenience
indicates early
installation, late nineteenth or early twentieth century. The two
Waukegan type wires are spliced to the early wires and are a type
still
manufactured.
They probably represent twentieth century
repairs. The wire with unequal strands was shallowly imbedded in a
large tree.
The tree, an oak, is a faster growing species than the
Osage Oranges which grew over specimens 1 and 2.
It appears the
unequal strand wire is a later installation than the other tree
imbedded wires. The Glidden wire, number 6, is a reverse-wound barb
version of the Glidden patent which is a comparatively recent
innovation in the manufacture of this wire.
CERAMICS
Sherds and Fragments
The ceramic artifact assemblage was sparse and predictable.
The
predictability stems from the time capsule nature of a trash pit which
is filled with refuse and covered over fairly rapidly.
Since such
features are deliberate repositories for artifacts and have a short
life, the surviving artifact array is composed mainly of items which
were in near contemporaneous or contemporaneous use. Since the root
cellar/trash pit is known to have been used for its second purpose no
earlier than the late 1920s and probably slightly later, the artifact
assembly should cluster in that time period for single use items with
reusables spanning that period and perhaps a decade or two prior. The
amount of ceramics expected from the hearth and door excavation
squares was low and proved to be the case. These areas were beneath
the structure and therefore subject to a certain amount of mechanical
size sorting of the artifacts deposited. Surface finds were few in
number and generally of probable recent origin.
Forty-eight ceramic fragments were recovered. Twenty sherds of
coarse, dull glazed earthernware were found which represent at least
four and no more than sixteen items, based on joins achieved and sherd
thickness.
No
useful
date attributions were possible as no
decorations, maker's marks, or inscriptions were present.
Two large
base fragments of a single thick walled crock or jug were recovered.
Eleven creamware sherds were found.
Plain white creamware is
available today and has been since the 1790s (Miller 1980:27). The
pattern impressed into the three rim sherds in this category is
identical to that shown in the 1927 Sears, Roebuck catalog as their
Snowflake White Semi-porcelain Dinnerware (Sears, Roebuck 1927:923).
Sears advertized this as its house brand and supplied individual
pieces to'replace those lost from a set (Sears, Roebuck 1927:914).
Among the eight non-rim creamware sherds, there are differences in
glaze crazing but no characteristics which would preclude their
belonging to the same pattern, and possibly the same pieces, as the

WALLING CABIN

Eleven ironstone sherds, all plain white, are included in the
ceramic assemblage.
Ironstone, unlike creamware, is stained white
(Binns 1910:24). Plain white ironstone came into popularity in the
mid-1850s and is available today. Two plate or hollowware base sherds
show partial maker's
marks
but
neither
is
sufficient
for
identification.
One consists of a single letter, a lower case 11 s 11 ,
and the other shows an 11 8 11 spaced to the 1eft of 11 42 11 •
The numera 1s
are probably a lot number or a pattern number which, unlinked with the
maker name, is non-diagnostic.
Five decorated sherds of pearlware were recovered.
Three of
these, two of them rimsherds, are transfer printed blue willow.
printed
Willow was one of the first patterns to be transfer
under-the-glaze, and is still available today (Miller 1980:28). A
blue willow pattern was available from Sears, Roebuck
Company
(1927:918).
The other two pearlware sherds have transfer printed
floral theme decorations, but the sherds are so small that the
specific pattern isn't readily identifiable. Floral theme patterns
are common on pearlware.
One fragment of a porcelain insulator, a segment insufficient for
identification of type, was recovered. The fragment is that adjacent
to a central hole through the insulator body, indicating the means of
attachment to a support, but such an arrangement as this was used on
dual wire house electrical mains, local power telephones, long wire
radio antennas and groundwires, lightning rod ground wires and
electrical fences.
When the development of the telephone
and
incandescent light bulb during the late 1870s and early 1880s resulted
in a need for a good insulation medium, it was realized that vitrified
ceramics was an ideal substance. The firm of R. Thomas and Sons of
East Liverpool, Ohio, produced the first commercial
electrical
insulators made from this medium in January 1885 (Gates and Ormerod
1982:287). More limiting with respect to date in this case is the
availability of any of the appliances or instruments requiring an
insulator. With the exception of the lightning rod, they cluster in
the 1920s, when telephone service, central electrical power and
commercial radio broadcast service began. In 1925, Henderson had 600
telephone connections in a city of about 2,500 population (Belo
Corporation 1925:339; 1982:189).
Extension of the telephone and
power systems to more rural areas came later, perhaps by more than a
decade. The nearest power and utility pole to the cabin site at
present is half a mile distant and is a service spur from a rural
cooperative of more recent vintage. The better choices for insulator
use appear to be lightning rod installation or battery powered radio
long wire antenna.
Six brick fragments, technically ceramics but usually treated
separately, came from the hearth square and four more from the root
cellar/trash pit. All are from bricks made of poorly homogenized clay
peppered with inclusions.
None is of sufficient size to allow more
than cursory analysis. Two have remnants of the outer surface of the
brick present and the color and texture coincide with whole brick
samples from the original pen chimney base.

insulator.
The raised letter inscription on the top surface reads
11
P.P. Inc. 5 1/2 Alligator". Split knob number 5 1/2 insulators
identical in shape to this one are advertised in the November 1925
Harry Alter 1 s Pocketbook (Alter 1925:4). The Harry Alter Company was
a prominent electric and radio supply wholesaler based in Chicago.
The 11 P.P. Inc 11 inscription is probably the hallmark of the Pioneer
Pottery Company of East Liverpool, Ohio. The insulator differs in
size and shape from the insulator fragment previously mentioned.
It
appears to be a good candidate for radio aerial use, an attribution
strengthened by the inclusion of four such insulators in a complete
aerial set advertised by the Alter Company (1925:174).
BRICK
Four bricks, three handmade and one modern wire cut, were
collected from the fireplace and chimney. The three handmades are
from the chimney base and the wire cut from the later chimney column.
Their physical characteristics and attributions are included in the
foregoing Fireplace and Chimney section.
Two of the bricks have special characteristics.
They have
impressions of the hands of those persons who handled them after they
were molded and prior to their firing. One has a thumb impression on
a stretcher surface made by someone lifting it while it was still
plastic (Figure 22e). The lifting was done with the right hand.
Any
marks which may have been left on the opposite strecher surface by the
other four fingers have been obscured by cross stacking another brick
on that surface, also prior to firing. This stacking method was
standard procedure in the drying of handmade brick (Davis 1889:14;
Millington 1839:65-66).
The thumb print probably resulted from the
turning of the newly molded brick to hasten drying. The second brick
shows even more evidence of handling (Figure 22c,d). The header
surface has the impressions of the forefinger, middle finger, and ring
finger of a left hand. The adjacent stretcher surface has the little
finger impression. That same surface also shows the impressions of
all four fingertips and the side of the thumb, this time the prints of
a right hand. The brick was apparently twice turned while still
plastic.
The relatively small size of the prints is consistent with
the assignment of a boy to the job of off-bearing and stacking the
newly molded brick in the period contemporary to the construction of
the fireplace and chimney (Crary 1890:51;
Millington 1839:65-66).
Alternatively, the marks may represent an attempt to remove a sticking
brick from the mold and a subsequent turning during the drying phase.

WALLING CABIN

METALLIC ARTIFACTS
One small metal artifact has defied positive identification.
It
is described and pictured in the hope of future attribution (Figure
30a). It is a petal or seed shaped object of stamped brass.
Its
length is 11/16 in and it has a thickness of only 3/64 in. A rough
edge at the more narrow end indicates it was broken off at this point.
When recovered from the hearth square excavation it was very nearly
discarded as a seed. Speculatively, it is part of a piece of costume
jewelry.
An automobile insignia or emblem was found during the excavation
of the slight depression behind and north of the cabin. The oval
shaped, 2 by 1 3/8 inch emblem has a screw back and the securing nut
is still threaded (Figure 30b). The automobile company logo displayed
is that of the Willys Overland Company of Toledo, Ohio, in this case
representing the Overland car.
John North· Willys took over the
Overland Company in 1908. He moved the company from Indianapolis to
Toledo in that year, reorganizing it as the Willys-Overland Company.
Willys-Overland produced the Overland car as the least expensive model
in a line that also included Stearns-Knight, Willys-Knight and
Whippet. Willys went on to become a Herbert Hoover appointee as
Ambassador to Poland in 1929. Willys-Overland Company, deprived of
his leadership and faced with the depression, crashed in 1933 with car
production
ceasing
in
1932.
Another reorganization followed
receivership status; Willys returned from Poland and took over again,
and Willys-Overland Motors, Inc. was formed (Rae 1959:49, 177-178 and
195). The emblem, still bearing remnants of blue and white enamel,
can be dated to the 1908-1932 period. Willys-Overland Inc. went on
to become the maker of the original Jeep, merged with Kaiser and
eventually with American Motors.
A number of artifacts were recovered which
characteristics in common:

have

the

following

1.

The artifact has no identification of a specific
manufacturing firm, model designation, size, batch
number, or proprietary symbol.

2.

The artifact exhibits no rare or unusual manufacturing
technique or the use of uncommon materials, nor is it a
handcrafted, unique item.

3.

The type of artifact was made over such a long period of
time without significant change that attribution to a
specific cabin occupant is not possible from the
artifact evidence alone.

4.

The artifact's presence at the site does not evidence a
cultural activity unusual to the site or region or one
that was heretofore unknown.

that a comparison among them is statistically invalid.
The artifacts which have characteristics meeting all of the above
criteria are treated herein by using a method which was suggested by
Thomas J. Schlereth 1 s promotion of the use of data contained in
appropriate mail order catalogs (Schlereth 1980:48-65). Schlereth 1 s
advocacy of the use of such catalogs in the study of material culture
of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries as collections of
contemporary assemblages is modified here to using the catalogs to
provide a contemporary description and depiction of artifacts
recovered. It also serves to place them in time in terms of
availability for inclusion in the context in which they were found.
The catalogs used are those of Sears, Roebuck (1902, 1922 and 1927),
and Montgomery Ward (1894-95 and 1922). These were selected because
they cover the period after the Early Economic Development era in
Texas through the known use of the root cellar for its original
purpose (See Historic Background).
They
begin
at
the
1894
W.A. Hubbard sale of the property to J.A. Vinson, the first two owners
who didn 1 t live on the property. The 1927 catalog was selected since
1927 is the last date verified by eyewitness testimony before the root
cellar became a trash pit (P. Young:1982). The 1902 catalog is used
because it is close to the turn of the century, yet is prior to the
introduction of automatic bottling equipment, asphalt rock covered
shingles and several other twentieth century innovations. Those from
1922 are fifty years plus a ten year 11 use life 1 factor from the date
of artifact recovery.
The artifacts are shown in Table 10 by name,
provenience, condition, catalog year
reference
and
page
and
catalog-supplied
nomenclature or use where not obvious.
Items
included in the table are those which appear in at least three catalog
years, insuring the time span requirement. Where an artifact differs
in some minor respect from the item catalogued, that difference is
noted.
Items which appear only in catalogs at either end of the time
span are shown in a separate table (Table 11). Table 11 also includes
items where a specific catalog match is not possible because the item
is a possible component of several compound wholes. Harness rings are
an example; lacking placement in a specific harness type, generic or
proprietary, a harness ring is potentially a part of a wide variety of
harness parts and therefore can not be confidently identified further
without collateral information. A sampling of artifacts found at the
Walling Cabin which were also listed in these catalogs is shown in
Figure 30 (c-f).
The two catalog-keyed tables integrate some of the artifacts
removed from the site by the 11 electronic pot-hunter 11 who searched the
area with a metal detector sometime between its discovery and the
commencement of mitigation. The intruder dug 22 holes, recovered an
unknown quantity of artifacts and left some of them in the drainage
ditch beside the road south of the cabin. The eleven ite~s in his
discard pile, augmented by five instances where the item dug up was
left by the hole from which it came, leaves the uncontestable
conclusion that at least six items, and probably more, are unaccounted
for, having been removed by the intruder.

MISCELLANEOUS ARTIFACTS
Twenty seven artifacts recovered have either obvious uses or no
specific use evidenced by the artifact itself. These items show no
characteristics useful in further establishing or defining cultural
activities at the site, and lack any characteristics useful in
deriving additional diagnostic data for the site. They share a time
span of manufacture too wide to provide a useful temporal fix and are
made from commonly used material in an unremarkable fashion. Most are
still available today.
They are included here in the interest of a

Additionally, 189 highly rusted, badly deteriorated metal
fragments weighing an aggregate of 754 grams were recovered. Of
these, 155 are nail fragments in all probability. The rest have lost
all semblance of their former shape and cannot be further identified.
POWDER HORN
Among the few artifacts recovered which may well date to the
earliest cabin occupancy is a horn container (Figure 29e). Horn has
been used to make containers for tinder, salt, pepper, and at least
three main types of powder horns (Montour 1980:42; Poese 1976:288).
This container is 9 inches in its largest, outside dimension. The tip
has been carved into a pouring spout and immediately below the spout
the horn has been thinned to accept a strap or thong for carrying.
Nine holes are irregularly spaced around the oval base to allow its
sealing by means of a plug now absent.
The horn sides show

124

WALLING CABIN

considerable decay and insect damage. The fibrous character of the
material is obvious, and some lamination is evident.
If decoration
were once present, it is no longer. The specimen was found inside the
west gable wall of the original cabin pen during the dismantling of
the door frame.
Use for salt or pepper is ruled out by the container 1 s size. Use
for tinder is not indicated due to the presence of the pouring spout.
The overall size is not great enough for use as a supply powder horn
and is too large for use as a primer powder horn. This is a standard
hunting powder horn, also the size carried in battle.
As further
proof of this usage, a non-replicable experiment was carried out. The
darker residue clinging to the interior of the horn was removed,
segregated from material obviously not powder, dried and burned. The
flaring characteristic of black powder occurred.
There is, of course, no way of ascertaining when the horn was
placed inside the wall. The absences of the plug, the carrying thong,
and the spout stopper are somewhat indicative that the horn was
obsolete and dismantled when placed in the wall. The plug and stopper
would have been made from hardwood and the carrying thong of leather
(Russell 1937:230). All these items would have preservation qualities
much similar to the horn and some vestige of their presen-ce would -have
been likely when the horn was found. The lack of these components
suggests the horn may have outlived its usefulness and had been
discarded, thus implying an early date for this artifact.
NAILS
Nails on a historic site, especially one occupied after the
partial automation of manufacturing techniques made them easily
available, are ubiquitous.
Unfortunately, rust,
corrosion
and
deterioration act quickly to blur their characteristics while still
leaving them recognizable as nails. The Walling Cabin is, in every
respect, no exception.
Nails were everywhere. It is somewhat of a
paradox that a structure which does not make use of nails to join the
main frame should use them with such frequency elsewhere. One reason
for the quantity of nails recovered, 782, was the decision by the
builder to floor and partially weather board the cabin. A second
factor is the quantity of nails used when the porch was added and when
the fireplace/chimney modification required filling in some wall
space. Also, several roofings of the structure involved high nail
usage.
Many more nail specimens could have been collected; the 782
are those found during excavation of the hearth and door squares,
those on the surface directly beneath the cabin pen, and a relatively
small quantity which were removed from the wood of the cabin during
the disassembly ~recess.
Nails in their crudest form date well into antiquity but the
100-year period beginning in the late eighteenth century saw a series
of manufacturing technique changes, inventions, improvements and
alterations which changed nails from a limited production/limited use

125

ARTIFACT DESCRIPTIONS

artisan's product to a universally-available, mass produced/high use
item.
It would be most helpful if one identifiable type of nail
supplanted another in an orderly sequence with little overlap, but
such is not the case. Nail types are persistent. Some early types
continue in production today claiming certain advantages over more
recently developed ones and making seriation inexact.
However,
supported by collateral evidence of age, nails are useful time
indicators and the lack of the later-developeed types in a structure
or part of a structure can be significant.
Identified by mode of manufacture, the major nail types are
wrought, cast, plate-cut and wire-cut. Wrought nails are produced by
shaping the heated metal stock with hammer blows while that stock is
held in or against a forming base. This is the classic blacksmith
hand tool operation with no automation. As a result, no two wrought
nails are alike. Wrought nails commonly have a square cross-section
(Hodges 1964:118). Cast nails are those produced by heating the metal
stock to melting and pouring it into molds. Most cast nails were made
by utilizing a mold pattern plate with a choice of head sizes and
shapes to obtain a series of head blanks. The full mold was then
produced by pressing a pointed hand tool into the center of the head
impressions to create the desired shank length and girth (Lenik
1977:45-46). Cast nails, as a result, are less individual than
wrought nails, particularly those resulting from the same casting
episode. A process for cast nails was patented in England in 1769.
Their use in the United States is known but rare. The use of either
wrought or cast nails in the Walling Cabin would have been possible
but a bit unusual due to the advent of plate cut nails.
Plate cut nails result from a manufacturing process dating from
the late eighteenth century whereby the nail is cut from metal plate
stock rolled or compacted to a suitable thickness.
Machines for
making such nails resulted in 88 patents issued between 1791 and 1815
(Nelson 1963:2). Improvements to the process continued through the
nineteenth century and hundreds more were patented. In general, the
products of these machines can be divided
into
five
phases
distinguishable by the results of the cutting and heading methods
utilized. These, with the approximate time span of manufacture, are:
1.

Both sides of the nail shank cut from the same
plate stock, hammered head, 1790s-1820s.

2.

Shank sides cut from opposite sides of the plate (a cut was
made and the plate reversed), hammered heads, 1810-1820s.

3.

Shanks cut from a common side
machine-made heading, 1815-1830s.

4.

Shank sides cut from
heads, 1820s-1830s.

head,

The shank cutting operation, opposite or common, can often be
determined by the cross-section of the nail if it is in fair
condition. The cutting process leaves shear marks - slight lipping of
the edges - representative of the cutting stroke direction. Care must
be exercised to distinguish the major shear, that of the cutting
stroke, . from those produced by the return of the cutting blade to its
original position. Distinguishing hammered heads from machine-made
heads is easily accomplished with well-preserved specimens due to the
asymmetrical characteristics of the handmade heads. The task becomes
more difficult as deterioration of the nail increases.
Wire cut nails are those which are formed from rolled, rodded
metal stock drawn into a wire of suitable diameter, then cut and
headed by machine. Machines for quantity production were in use
around 1890.
These are highly uniform nails within their size
categories and are easily distinguished by their round shanks.
Their
presence at the Walling Cabin site is due to the additions and repairs
done about the turn of the century and later. Their presence would be
expected in the later roofing and roof support framing.
Most nails are size-designated by a relict measurement system
which was based on the price per hundred expressed in English pennies
(Noel Hume: 1969:252). Sizes extend from the smallest, 2 penny,
expressed as 2d, up to 60 penny, or 60d. A 2d nail is one inch long,
a 60d is six inches. From 2d to 16d lengths increase in one-quarter
inch increments, thus a 3d nail is one and one-quarter inches long, a
4d is one and one- half, etc. Those above 16d increase by one-half
inch increments.
These penny sizes are those in current use. There
have been variations in the past.
Table 12 shows nail length
standards from a number of sources.
To complicate matters, length in square wrought, cast and cut
nails is measured tip to tip while in wire cut nails it is measured
from beneath the head to the point, except when the head is
countersunk (CF and I:
1982:9).
Nails shorter than an inch are
called brads or tacks and do not fit into the penny measuring system.
There is no clear demarcation between nails and spikes but most
sources apply the term spike at the 30d size and general agreement is
reached for fasteners exceeding 60d. Within length designations there
may be several shank diameter sizes expressed in wire gauge size.
A
3d nail can be had in 19 different wire gauges, from .283 inch to .054
inch. Shank diameter then, in an incomplete specimen, is not a clear
indicator of penny size.
The nails recovered from the cabin site were examined for
evidence of casting:
lack of edge lipping, sprue mark presence and
mold seam marks at the juncture of the head and shank. No cast nails
were present.
Evidence was sought for wrought metal manufacture:
tapering on all four shank
sides,
hand-hammered
heads,
and

hand-hammered points.
No specimens of this type were present. The
full complement of recovered specimens were assignable to the cut
plate or wire cut categories. Wire cut specimens totaled 548, ranging
from 2d to 40d. Cut plate specimens totaled 234 ranging from 3d to
50d. One large incomplete specimen weighs more than twice that of the
20d specimens but is slightly less than 4 inches long, the common
length of the 20d nails. It weighs 43.5 grams and is undeniably a
spike. The 58 nails that were recovered from the wood into which they
had been driven are shown in Table 13. Identically sized manufacture
and phase types with essentially the same provenience are shown as one
entry with appropriate numbers.
Virtually all fastener provenienced nails appear to be in concert
with the building construction chronology postulated for the cabin and
its alterations or additions. Composition shingle is found held by a
wire nail (No. 20), inside furring strips held by a variety of cut
nails (Nos. 1-7), a shake with a cut nail (No. 19), etc. The mixture
of sizes of wire nails used to secure other shakes (Nos. 14-18)
East and west wall outside
appears to indicate a repair episode.
furring strips fastened with virtually identical 20d, cut, rosehead
nails mediate in the direction of a single episode of weather boarding
prior to or contemporary with the addition of the dog trot and prior
to the general availability of wire nails (Nos. 34-39 and 42-45). The
dog trot sleeper (floor support) yielded four cut nails in three sizes
(Nos. 25, 26, 27 arid 28) and a single wire nail (No. 24).
Tremont
Nail Company recommends 8d as the appropriate cut nail size for
flooring but in this case two large 20d nails of different head
configuration, a 12d and a 5d were used (Johnson 1971:15). Only the

7d wire nail (No. 24) approaches the size most appropriate.
This
mixture suggests the flooring was accomplished with material on hand
which had been acquired for other purposes. It also fairly rules out
the job being accomplished by a hired carpenter, who would be unlikely
to waste such large nails on securing flooring with the risk of
splitting the boards.
Only one fastener-provenienced nail made during a cut nail
manufacturing phase now obsolete was present (No. 22). Its 12d size
and crude machine-made hinge head make it a good candidate for reuse
when considered along with the presence of a later phased, and more
appropriate to the job, 20d in the same rafter (No. 23).

In summary, the nail artifacts in useful context support the
construction sequence indicated by other evidence and conform in dates
to the periods during which the structure was originated, altered or
repaired.
No very early cut types were present nor were cast or
wrought types, and none had been expected.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
EVALUATION OF RESEARCH DESIGN
The keynote queries relating to historical documentation of the
cabin, its chain of ownership, and its links to Thomas Jefferson
Walling, were well established by the evidence.
References to
Walling 1 s ownership and occupancy appear in the Harrison Probate
papers (Rusk County Probate file 729), specifically in the rental
agreement between Catherine Harrison and B.C. Oberthier (Figure 5),
and in a document pressing a claim for monies due on a note of debt.
The latter is a petition of the court on behalf of T.J. Walling, that
the outstanding debt and damages be satisfied by sale of the property.
The property and the conditions of its sale to John Harrison are
described in detail (Rusk County Probate file 729, petition dated
Feb. 14, 1868).
Reference to origin date is found in Walling 1 s own
description of the move from the Nacogdoches area to the cabin site
included in the Robertson letter of 1875, and the land grant
documentation in Nacogdoches County records. The chain of ownership
is well documented by title trace and, surprisingly, occupancy by
those nineteenth century owners who were actually in residence was
traced.
Twentieth century occupancy is known primarily through the
several informants who once lived in the cabin and still reside in the

and further the understanding of the written and artifactual records
to a degree beyond that usually available. The photographs supplied
by the Young family aided interpretation and confirmed suppositions
which might otherwise have remained strongly suspected but not
absolutely verified.
Site recording and interpretation questions were successfully
answered with respect to basic queries. Artifactual questions dealing
with concentrations and patterns were less fully achieved.
The
correlation of surface cultural evidence and subsurface detection of
cultural remains by the metal detector search proved, in this case, a
useful approach. The attempt was marred by the electronic pot hunting
incident in that the sample universe was disturbed.
The metal
detector results assisted in the selection of excavation areas. This
approach was validated by the quantity of artifacts recovered.

has been requested, accepted and declared (U.S. Department of the
Interior, letter June 30, 1982 - Determination of Eligibility).
Artifact analyses keynotes were hampered by the small number of
very early remains.
However, the large number of structure-related
and discrete time frame artifacts aided determination of the cabin
construction and repair sequences and isolated the original cabin
components from later additions and alterations.
In retrospect, the research design served well but could have
been made more effective by some changes in emphasis. Specifically,
informants could have been sought earlier, and tape recordings of
their contributions should have been made, where feasible. Additional
machine-dug test trenches would have assisted in cultural debris
pattern
study.
Collection
of artifacts uncovered during the
disassembly of the cabin was hampered by the dismantling operation.
The nail free construction of the basic log frame made it hazardous to
remove some single large structural members and then
suspend
operations for examination.
Heightened security measures and less
publicity might have prevented the pot hunting incident, but its
occurrence must be weighed against the information which resulted from
the publicity.
Briefly, the research design required few alterations, none of
major proportions, and was appropriate to the goal of recording the
cabin's history prelude to its relocation and restoration.
At the
same time, the research design proved effective in obtaining the
greatest possible insight into both the general
and
specific
circumstances of the individual site and others similar to it.
SUMMARY
The mitigative investigation of the Walling Cabin site described
herein was a necessary prelude to its relocation and restoration. Its
ownership chain,
occupancy,
construction
sequence,
and the
alterations, additions and repairs made to it, were documented from
records derived from the cultural evidence and confirmed by
examination augmented by photographic records. The success of the
mitigation program is reflected in the successful restoration of the
original cabin pen.
The restored cabin is now part of a museum
complex in nearby Henderson, Texas. The structure (Figure 31) was
presented to the county and town during the celebration of Henderson
and Rusk County's 140th anniversary on September 24, 1983..
A Texas
State Historical medallion was unveiled by the only surv1v1ng
granddaughter of T.J. Walling - octagenarian Mrs. Lula Hal Hildebrand.
More than a hundred Walling family members, about half of them direct
descendents of Thomas Jefferson Walling, attended the ceremony and
accompanying celebration.

Shim - A thin piece of material, in the case of the cabin wood, used
to fill spaces between the logs and weather boards. This
permits the construction of a more nearly vertical wall.
Shingle - A roof board which may be sawn or riven, tapered or
untapered.
Wood shingles are generally smaller than shakes
and unlike shakes are usually uniform one with the rest made
at
the same time.
Walling Cabin wood shingles were
untapered, sawn and measured a fairly uniform five inch
width, 18 inch length, 1/4 inch thickness. The shakes they
covered were non-uniform, riven boards more than a foot
wide, up to three feet long and about 1/2 inch thick.

very small covered pits not usually called cellars because
of that small size.
Weather board - A type of siding consisting of untapered milled lumber
nailed over a log wall to provide a vertical wall surface,
fill the spaces between the logs and conceal the logs.
Weather board was used on the outside gable walls of the
Walling Cabin from the first and was applied to the outside
front, outside rear and inside fireplace wall sometime after
original construction.
Wire cut brick - Brick produced by extruding under pressure a stiff
but plastic clay through a die and cutting the extruding

Herb Eling worked photographic wonders with my negatives. Solveig
Turpin provided essential editorial guidance and project oversight.
Comments on the draft were provided by Dr. James A. Neely of the
University of Texas Anthropology Department and Patience Patterson
of the Texas Historical Commission.
The cooperation of Dick Robertson of Texas Utilities Services,
Inc. is much appreciated. In addition to assistance in compiling the
HABS drawings, Dick went so far as to help mark and load logs for
movement to the restoration site.
·Any listing of those who contributed from Rusk County would
include a major segment of the County's population. This was truly
a community project. Indeed, so many individuals and organizations
were involved that the project can be said to be of the community and
not just for it.
Among those I would like to recognize for their contribution
are Virginia Knapp, the driving force behind the restoration effort,
Doris Threadgill, who saw to the authenticity of the furnishings among
many other contributions, Betty Jo Walker, who oversaw the authentic
production of replacement parts, Carl Hessee, project leader of the
restoral, and Edgar Partin, who along with volunteers Robert Coleman,
Patrick Bradford, Everett Skinner, James Bynum, Mart Hooper, James
Bradshaw, Bobby H. Walker, John Wright, Bobby Joe Walker, Jay Clements,
Lane Gossage, Jeff Nichols and John Wylie, raised the cabin in its new
location. The ironwork and brickwork done by Michael Weaver and Larry
Stuart is outstanding.
Archival assistance camEf from Mrs. Maida Jaggers and Mr. and Mrs.
Preston Young. Among many organizations and agencies participating,
particularly outstanding contributions were made-by the people of the
Lions Club, those of the Office of the County Clerk, those of the
Office of Judge James Porter and the entire membership of the Rusk
County Historical Co11111ission.
On a personal level, I would like to thank the whole county and
particularly Virginia Knapp, Maida Jaggers, Doris Threadgill and Susan
Weaver for extending to me and my co-workers every assistance and making
me feel like I belonged there,
