ABSTRACT
Between August 2008 and August 2009, DETAC (Deep East Texas Archaeological
Consultants) conducted a cultural resources survey of the proposed Mt. Pleasant waterline
and reroutes in Titus County, Texas for Advanced Ecology, Inc. under Antiquities Permit
5010. The pipeline includes 7.5 kilometers (4.7 miles) of buried pipeline in a new right-ofway of which 3.1 km (1.9 miles) will parallel the proposed Mt. Pleasant Bypass. Visual
examination and shovel tests were employed at required intervals in designated low and
high probability areas. Shovel testing was successful in finding two new archeological
sites, 41TT903 and 41TT904. Site 41TT903 is the location of a house built in the latter
half of the twentieth century and removed once it fell into disrepair. Site 41TT904 is a
late Caddoan open camp site on the toe slope/terrace remnant in the Tankesley Creek
floodplain. Shovel testing east and west of the site may associate the site with previously
recorded sites, but negative tests along the right-of-way show the pipeline will avoid all
artifact concentrations on the site. The landowner, Bill Prefert, requested that all artifacts
be returned to him. No artifacts were curated. Additionally, previously recorded sites,
41TT6 and 41TT855, were to be impacted by the proposed pipeline. Excavations in 1934
found several Caddo burials but no associated cultural features and shovel testing in 2002
followed by auger testing and backhoe trenching on 41TT6 found few additional artifacts.
The latest testing on 41TT6 suggests the proposed pipeline will avoid the important portion
of the site. Shovel testing in 2002 on 41TT855 found few prehistoric and historic period
artifacts. No further work was recommended in 2002 and no further work is recommended
with the current investigations. No artifacts were found on either site during the current
investigations. After an initial review by the Texas Historic Commission, the City of Mt.
Pleasant proposed boring under 41TT6 and 41TT904 to avoid impacts to either site.
DETAC requests concurrence with a determination of “no effect” to NRHP eligible or
listed properties and State Archaeological Landmarks for the proposed pipeline with the
exception that the pipeline will bore under 41TT6 and 41TT904.

INTRODUCTION
Between August 2008 and August 2009, DETAC (Deep East Texas Archaeological
Consultants) conducted a cultural resources survey of the proposed Mt. Pleasant water pipelines
between a new water facility and the City of Mt. Pleasant in Titus County, Texas for Advanced
Ecology, Inc. (Figure 1). The pipelines included 7.5 kilometers (4.7 miles) of new right-of-way.
The pipeline right-of-way included a cleared area roughly 15 m (50 ft) wide with a trench
roughly 120 to 150 centimeters (cm) (48 and 60 inches) deep along the centerline with bores
under one previously recorded site, 41TT6, and on newly documented site, 41TT904. The
project area incorporated roughly 10.3 hectares (25.5 acres). Cultural resource management was
required because the project will be permitted by the Texas Water Development Board. All
archaeological work was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit 5010.

The report was

reviewed by the Texas Historical Commission.
All of the corridor will be new construction planned to follow the Mt. Pleasant Bypass for
most of the distance from the southeast to the northwest with a pipeline extending to the proposed
Water Treatment Facility west of Tankersley Creek. Of the length of the pipeline, 2.8 km (1.7
miles) was within previously surveyed areas for the Bypass. The Bypass survey by Perttula and
Nelson (2005) revisited two sites and recorded 12 sites. Of these 14 sites, the proposed pipeline
will pass through or near 41TT6, 41TT855, and 41TT866. Sites 41TT6 and 41TT866 were
recommended for further testing (Perttula and Nelson 2005: 29 Table 1). Auger testing on 41TT6
in 2008 found debitage in one test of the roughly 19 along the proposed water line (Fields 2008).
Shovel testing for the current project along the right-of-way in the vicinity of both 41TT6 and
41TT866 failed to find any cultural material; no further work is recommended along the proposed
pipeline.
Two new cultural resources were found during the survey, 41TT903, a historic period
house, and 41TT904, a prehistoric open camp site. In a initial draft of the report, DETAC
recommended a determination of “no effect” to cultural resources for the pipeline as the pipeline
will be placed in areas with negative shovel tests; however, the THC requested monitoring of
41TT6 and 41TT904 (Martin 2008). The City of Mt. Pleasant, through KSA Engineers and
Advanced Ecology, recommended boring the pipeline under 41TT6 and 41TT904. DETAC
requests that the project proceed and a determination of “no effect” to NRHP properties and
State Archaeological Landmarks given 41TT6 and 41TT904 are bored under.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The study area for the proposed project falls within the Eastern Timbered Plain
Physiographic Province of east Texas. This province is part of the larger Gulf Coastal Plain
(Bureau of Economic Geology (BEG), 1970, 1977) and the Austroriparian biotic province. The
Austroriparian biotic province is typified by extensive pine and hardwood forests, swamps,
marshes, and other hydric communities (Blair 1950). Environmental factors that affect the biotic
provinces, and therefore the use of the landscape by prehistoric and early historic populations
include geology, paleoenvironment and the resultant soils with surface geology, geomorphology,
and environment the factors that determine the types of soils at a given location. Therefore, the
environmental setting is divided into Geology, Paleoenvionrment, and Soils sections.

Geology
The Gulf Coastal Plain is an elevated former sea bottom (Hunt 1974) formed during the
Cenozoic Era when cycles of interbedded marine clays and shale from transgressions and
unconsolidated sandy fluvial-deltaic regression of the ancestral Gulf of Mexico deposited sands,
shales, clays, and marls in sedimentary geologic formations (Thorkildsen et al. 1989:9). Moreresistant strata form escarpments or cuestas with rolling hills and prairies (Fisher 1965). The
streams that flow through these hills and prairies typically have floodplains 1.6 to 16 km (1 to 10
miles) wide. These floodplains generally occur 30.5 to 46 m (100 to 150 ft) below the regular
elevation of the land creating narrower floodplains where streams cut through the cuestas.
The geologic units in the area includes the Eocene age Wilcox Group with Quaternary
alluvium along the Tankersley Creek floodplain. The Wilcox Group undivided consists of fine
to coarse quartz sandstone in the upper layers with increasing amounts of glauconitic, clay, and
lignite and plant fossils with depth in beds 3 to 15 m (10 to 50 ft) thick (Thorkildsen and Price
1991:11). Because of the age, the Wilcox Group is significantly older and has been subjected to
more erosion leaving the ridge summits with shallow sandy soils and redepositing the material
into vally floors. Quaternary Alluvium includes more recent stream channel, back swamp,
natural levee, and point bar areas (BEG, 1968) consisting of material eroded from the nearby
uplands. In a Geoarchaeological context, these two extremes are divided by toe slopes and
potently unmapped stream terraces which contain deeper sandy soils than the uplands and are
also more stable than the annual floodplain. These deeper, stable, well drained soils were in close
3

proximity to surface water yet still benefited planted crops from subsurface water down slope.
The dynamic, and geologically recent, changes caused by the stream channel is
geomorphologically unmapped; however, soil surveys collect data to a depth of 203 cm (80
inches) or roughly twice the depth of the planned excavation. Based on this information, soil
series with buried sandy soils are targets for deeper geomorphic testing and toe slopes require
shovel testing at high probability intervals.

Paleoenvironment
The Paleoenvironment for eastern Texas is largely dependent on information from
paleontological investigations of extinct flora and fauna as well as fossil pollen grains recovered
from bogs and archaeological sites in central, northern, and west Texas which contain deposits
spanning the past 34,000 years. Little paleoenvionmental information is available from east
Texas because there are few locations sheltered from the environment and the acidic oxisols and
alfisols combined with the repeated wetting and drying often destroy pollen grains (Bryant and
Holloway 1985:54).

Given the lack of information about the region directly, only

generalizations and simplifications of the environment are possible relying on data from adjacent
ecological regions.
Beginning in the Wisconsin Interpluvial Period between 33,500 and 22,500 B.P.,
environmental data suggests south and east Texas were at the boundary of scrubby vegetation
and grasslands to the west and deciduous forests to the east (Bryant and Schafer 1977:7; Bryant
and Holloway 1985:44) with a generally cooler and wetter climate than today (Bryant and
Holloway 1985:50). Although the source of the rivers were not glacial run-off, the Texas coastal
plain rivers, e.g., Sabine, were cooler and subsequent discharge into the Gulf of Mexico cooler
reducing the gulf temperature and reducing the precipitation generated by warm water close to
land and large scale Tropical cyclonic events (Blum and Aslan 2005:182).

The effective

moisture during this period was derived from mid-latitude events that, when combined with the
increased moisture, caused soil instability across the region (Blum and Aslan 2005:183).
The Wisconsin Fullglacial Period between 22,500 and 14,000 B.P. was a shift to forests
in the region as vegetation change to more conifer, pine, and spruce trees (Bryant and Schafer
1977:11) in a semi-arid temperate woodland that covered central Texas, the northwestern gulf
coast, and present-day southern Louisiana (Adams and Faure 1997:630, 637). This semi-arid
4

temperate woodland included significantly cooler and moister summers but winters that were
similar to present day temperatures (Toomey et al. 1993:305). Geomorphologicaly, the Sabine
River, like the Trinity, reacted to the drop in eustatic sea level causing valley incision (Ferring
1990:45).
The Late-Glacial period from 14,000 to 10,000 B.P. saw rapid increases in temperature
and associated decrease in effective moisture in three steps at 14,500 B.P., 12,500 B.P., and
10,500 B.P. which correspond with max meltwater discharge in glacier-fed rivers and decrease
evaporation (Toomey et al. 1993:306). The drier weather would lessen the recharge of rivers not
supplied by glaciers, e.g., the Sabine and Trinity rivers, and may have reduced the flow to
braided streams allowing for increased alluvial deposits and more eolian movement of
sediments. Research by Bryant and Schafer (1977:14), Bousman (1998: Figure 4), and Ferring
(1995: Figure 4.5) shows these warming steps altered animal and plant life in the region with the
return of grass-dominated setting, which in turn caused widespread landscape instabilities (Blum
and Aslan 2005:183).
The Postglacial Period from 10,500 B.P. to present was a continuation of the Late-glacial
Period with temperate grasslands in a savanna setting (Bryant and Schafer 1977:18) that
extended from the gulf coast northward to Canada (Adams and Faure 1997:630, 637). These
conditions of warmer temperatures and drier climate continued until modern times that began
with a more grassland dominated environment around 9,500 B.P. but stabilized then dropped
dramatically between 7,000 and 5,000 B.P. (Ferring 1995:24) causing animals that required more
moisture to leave the area (Toomey et al. 1993:308). After this dry period, the climate across the
region varied with both moist (5000-2000 B.P. and after 1000 B.P.) and dry periods (Ferring
1995:30). Dendrochronological information has provided additional and more refined data for
the more recent time with six droughts between 1000 B.P. and today lasting as long as 30 years
and eleven extremely wet periods lasting on average two years but as long as 9 years in the same
2000 year time ranged (Stahle 1996). These dramatic climate changes would have effected
human and animal populations alike forcing abandonment of some locations, e.g., seeps and
springs from annual runoff and consolidation in others, e.g., along larger stream channels.

Soils
The combination of geologic deposits, alluvial geomorphology, and both vegetation and
climate variation over time produced varying soils that reflect the differences in these factors across
the landscape. The results of these changes are described in the soils information retrieved from
the NRCS on-line digital soils data for Rusk and Panola counties (NRCS 2008).
Upland soil series include Freestone, Wolfpen, and Woodtell series. The upland series
formed on Wilcox Group formations. Soil depth is largely dependent on the slope and amount of
erosion from farming and logging over the past 100 years. Upland Freestone series soils typically
consists of 30 cm (12 inches) fine sandy loam over clay loam. Wolfpen series soils include 50 cm
(20 inches) of loamy fine sand over sandy clay loam. Woodtell series soils include 15 cm (6
inches) of fine sandy loam over clay derived from clayey residuum parent material.
Lowland soils include Besner-Talco complex on stream terraces and toe slopes with Estes
in the Tankersley Creek floodplain and Nahatche complex in between uplands along small stream
floodplain. Besner-Talco complex includes Besner fine sandy loam 80 cm (31 inches) deep over
loam on convex surfaces and Talco silt loam 160 cm 64 inches) deep over clay loam on concave
surfaces. Estes and Nahatche soils series are frequently flooded and are derived from quaternary
loamy alluvium. The Estes and Nahatche series include 20 to 30 cm (8 to 12 inches) of silt loam
over clay loam and clay. These poorly drained soils formed in loamy alluvium graying with depth.

CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY

The Cultural Chronology is divided into Paleo-Indian, Archaic, Early Ceramic, Late
Prehistoric, and Historic periods.

Each period was delineated by a change in environment,

technology, and/or population requiring adaptations to meet varying circumstances. Each period is
described in reference to the cultural phases within the period, settlement patterns, subsistence, and
artifacts associated with the period.

Paleo-Indian Period
The Paleo-Indian period (prior to 6000 B.C.) is the earliest generally accepted cultural
period in the New World and includes populations that inhabited North America from the Late
Pleistocene to the early Holocene.

Paleo-Indian sites are typified by scattered Clovis,

Scottsbluff, Dalton, San Patrice, and Plainview projectile points, these sites are rare in the
region. Overall, tool types are generally carefully fashioned bifacal and unifacial tools. The use
of non-local materials and recycling lead Story (1990) to suggest this population was organized
into small, mobile bands of hunters and gatherers that consumed a variety of plants and animals.
Paleo-Indian artifacts recovered in the region suggested that early occupations were principally
distributed in the valleys of major stream basins (Perttula 1995). However, observed sites from
the Paleo-Indian period are less frequent in active floodplains because of the changes in the
landscape since those periods (Waters 1992:151).

Archaic
The Archaic (6000-400 B.C.) refers to hunter-gatherers who implemented more regionally
specialized approaches toward exploiting their environment. The Archaic period is represented by
three divisions: the Early, Middle, and Late Archaic during which tool technology progressed from
the large points that typify the Paleo-Indian period to the use of sand and grog tempered ceramics
and the bow and arrow in the Early Ceramic and Late Prehistoric. The Early Archaic is viewed as
transitional from Paleo-Indian to Archaic (Duffield 1963) with technology and population as the
driving forces, requiring a greater emphasis on territoriality and a greater reliance on the inferior,
local east Texas lithic resources. The Middle Archaic subsistence strategies remained dependent
on a hunting and gathering economy with a greater reliance on native plants (Thurmond 1990).
7

The Late Archaic period occupations remained dependent on seasonal variations in food sources
and probably moved whenever a food source became scarce or unavailable (Story 1990). Later
Archaic site distributions show a shift from major streams to minor streams and natural springs
(Perttula and Skiles 1986: 48-53). This greater number and distribution of Late Archaic sites in
East Texas suggests the successful adaptation to the environment lasting until the development of
pottery (around 500-100 B.C) and/or until the development of the bow and arrow. Stone-lined
hearths, baking pits, milling implements, and polished stone serve as indicators of new
technologies (Story 1990:213).

When compared to Paleo-Indian artifacts, Archaic lithic

assemblages are more functionally varied; however, tool types are generally less well made and of
more local materials than the Paleo-Indian period. Cemeteries date to the Archaic period as well
(Story 1990). Projectile point types associated with the Archaic period include Gary, Elam,
Edgewood, Ellis, and Yarbrough.

Early Ceramic Period
The Early Ceramic (200 B.C.-A.D. 800) period (Story 1990:293), also referred to as the
Woodland period (Perttula et al. 1986), represented an increasing utilization of the environment. A
number of characteristic innovations appear during the Early Ceramic period. In particular, there is
a greater reliance on cultigens along with larger and more prolonged occupations at specific
locales.

The technological innovation appearing during the Early Ceramic period was the

widespread production of pottery and the introduction of the bow and arrow very late in the period
(Story et al. 1990; Thurmond 1990). Pottery, or at least the surface decorations, were probably
introduced from the Lower Mississippi Valley as Marksville Stamped, Marksville Incised,
Tchefuncte Stamped, Troyville Stamped, and Chrupa Incised have been found along the Sabine
River (Story 1990; Thurmond 1988; Cliff and Peter 1994:23). Gary and Kent projectile points
were made smaller and lighter and corner-notched arrow points enter the archaeological record at
this period as well (Thrumond 1990).

Late Prehistoric Period
In the Late Prehistoric period (A.D. 800-1680) in Harrison County is principally concerned
with the Caddoan culture. The Late Prehistoric Period has been divided into Formative, Early,
Middle, and Late Caddoan phases. The phases indicate changes in socio-political, habitation, and
8

material culture. Overall, the Late Prehistoric Period is typified by a variety of arrowpoints, ground
stone artifacts, and a ceramic vessel types. The Caddo culture was an indigenous development
strongly influenced by the Mississippian tradition of the Lower Mississippi Valley (Story
1990:323; Wycoff 1971). Caddo subsistence and social organization differed markedly from the
Archaic and Early Ceramic periods as horticulture supplemented hunting and gathering followed
by a diet dominated by maize, beans, and squash. Increasingly larger aggregates of people became
sedentary and constructed villages with public ceremonial areas. A stratified social structure
developed, corresponding to the chiefdom level as first defined by Service (1962, 1975). Extensive
commercial networks were also established with hamlets and farmsteads surrounding larger
community mound center. Settlements were mainly distributed on elevated landforms adjacent to
major streams, as well as along minor tributaries and spring-fed branches.

Historic
The area that is now Titus County was in close proximity to several of the early European
investigations to included the 1542 De Soto expedition under Luis de Moscoso (Schambach
1989) followed by Hernando Martin, Diego del Castello. The first Anglo settler was Kendall
Lewis in 1835 but the area was not permanently inhabited until the 1840’s. Historic period Indian
populations were subjected to immigrants from other tribes and eventual disposition to Indian
Territory outside of Texas at the same time. Initially, Titus County was formed in 1846 and
included Morris and Franklin Counties. The early economy of Titus County was based on
agriculture with corn and cotton as the two most important crops following the methods many of
the immigrants brought with them from the southern United States. Settlement intensified over
the next twenty years as several plantations were established. The civil war and the abolition of
slavery were disastrous to the economy as the plantations were not able to plant or harvest crops
without slave labor. Racial tensions culminated in a failure of cotton crops in 1867 and military
intervention to prevent violence. Franklin and Morris counties were extracted in 1875 with the
arrival of industry in the area. The industry boom and the arrival of the railroad in 1878 promoted
growth; however, the arrival of the Great Depression kept profits low. The discovery of oil in
1936 and the arrival of more industry with World War II helped diversify Titus County’s
economic status. Today, the area has continued to diversify as manufacturing, lumber, ranching,
and mining (Webb 1952).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
A review of the official site location maps and files at TARL and the Texas Archaeological
Site Atlas (Texas Historical Commission (THC) 2008) revealed several archaeological sites and
surveys near the project area. The earliest archaeological work in the area is poorly documented,
but the sites found during this work were included into the individual segments described in the
Results section of this report. The surveys are divided into small surveys of linear projects
typically along existing road or disturbed areas and large surveys of areas typically undisturbed or
of minimal impacts by development.
Small surveys near the proposed pipeline include six projects: the Water Development
Board (WDB) (Daniel et al. 1995) west of the Tankersley Creek floodplain, TxDot (Gadus 2000)
along F.M. 127, Southwest Electrical Power Company (SWEPCO) (Carpenter and Drake 1994)
along a powerline near the Water Treatment Facility, the Water Treatment Facility (Galan 2007), a
FHA survey (Cliff et al. 2008), and a private pipeline (Galan 2001). Of these three surveys the
WDB was successful in documenting 41TT681, the TxDot survey was successful in documenting
41TT823 and 41TT824, the SWPCO survey documented 41TT649 all along the toe slopes of
ridges overlooking Tankersley Creek. The survey for the Water Treatment Facility, the FHA and
the pipeline were in upland settings and were not successful in documenting any cultural resources.
None of the sites recorded during these surveys is within 100 m of the project area.
Large surveys near the proposed pipeline include the surveys by PBS&J for the Montecello
Strip Mine west of Mt. Pleasant and the survey for the Mt. Pleasant Bypass. The strip mine survey
was conducted over several years in the 1990’s and was successful in documenting several sites
from Archaic to Historic periods in a variety of topographic settings. Most relevant to the current
project is the survey for TxDot’s Mt. Pleasant Bypass (Perttula and Nelson 2005). Perttula and
Nelson (2007:29 Table 1) examined 172 ha. (425 acres) in which they revisited 41TT6 and
41TT824 along with documenting 10 sites (41TT846-849, 855, 856, 861, 863, 866, 867) between
Hwy 271 and F.M. 127. Shovel tests for the survey focused on high probability areas only;
however, the survey documented sites in roughly 22.9% of the project area versus sites on 12.6%
of similar size and setting project areas around Big Cypress Creek (Perttula and Nelson 2005:51).
Of the sites within 300 m (985 ft) of the current project area, no further work was recommended for
sites 41TT848, 849, 855, and 861 while testing excavations were recommended for 41TT6, 846,
847, 856, 863, 866, and 867. No report detailing testing efforts on these sites was available at the
10

time of the current pipeline survey; however, information detailing a recent testing effort on 41TT6
was provided by Prewitt and Associates (Fields 2008). Individual site descriptions are discussed
in more detail with their relationship to the proposed pipeline in the Results section of the report.
In addition to the fieldwork referenced above, several documents have added significantly
to available information on the archaeological record in this region. The documents of primary
importance are D.A. Story's (1990) and J.A. Guy's (1990) discussions of the Gulf Coastal Plain as
well as Thurmond (1990) description of sites in the Cypress Creek Drainage Basin. These studies
provide general models for predicting site location and associating artifacts that may be found
during the survey with particular cultural phases. Additionally, the Texas Historical Commission,
Department of Antiquities Protection developed a document for the east Texas portion of the Texas
State Plan (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993). This document includes several historic contexts each of
which deals with a particular facet of northeast Texas prehistory. This plan serves to synthesize the
current state of archaeological research in the region and identify problems and objectives to be
addressed in future research and cultural resources management.

Several weak areas in

archaeological knowledge of the region are identified in these recent studies.

Chronology,

settlement patterns, subsistence, and historic continuities are some of the general research
directions that all of these recent syntheses emphasize as important for developing future
archaeological research designs.

SURVEY DESIGN
Before initiating fieldwork, DETAC conducted a records and literature review using the
Texas Archaeological Site Atlas (THC 2008) based on maps and files at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL), J.J. Pickle Research Campus, UT. The site location maps and
cultural resources records at TARL were consulted to identify the location, types, and both State
Archaeological Landmarks (SAL) and NRHP eligibility of previously recorded sites within or in
close proximity to the project areas. The Site Atlas also contains information about published
and unpublished data regarding cultural resource surveys.
DETAC performed these investigations in compliance with the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966 (Public Law [PL] 89-665), as amended in 1974 (PL 97-442), 1976 and
1980; the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL 81-190, 83 Stat. 915, 42 USC 4321,
1970); Procedures for the Protection of Historic and Cultural Properties (36 CFR 800); the
Archeological Resources protection Act of 1979; and the other appropriate cultural resources
legislation and guidelines. The investigations also complied with the procedural rules of the
Texas Antiquities Code.
Based on the previous investigations and cultural history, it was possible to create a
rudimentary model for determining high and low probability areas and the types and amount of
cultural material expected. In general, both prehistoric and historic sites were found adjacent to
the floodplains, on first terraces, or along the toe slopes of higher ridges (McCormick 1973; Hsu
1969; Thurmond 1990). Thurmond (1990:215) provided tables of site distribution across the
landscape for the Big Cypress Creek Basin. Thurmond’s study found that 503 (97.8%) of the
515 sites he examined were in valleys or along terrace ridges overlooking floodplains. Of the
515 sites examined, 430 (83.7%) were situated in or near floodplains greater than 10 square
kilometers in size. Other investigations revealed the highest density of sites occur along high
order streams and on land forms such as knolls, bluffs, terraces, ridges and stream interfluves
generally within 300 m of a water source on level landforms with deep well-drained soils as
these environments provide dryer conditions for year-round occupation (Galan 1996; 1997,
Perttula and Nelson 2005:52). Sites in seasonally wet areas are typically more ephemeral
occupations and are frequently destroyed by annual flooding and stream channel migration.
Cultural resources on floodplains are less frequent unless the site is on a levee or other sandy
landform that is smaller than the mapped soil series as described in Thurmond (1990:217 Figure
12

29) survey of the Cypress Creek Drainage Basin.

Historic occupations are expected to be

farmsteads dating from the 1840s to modern times situated close to perennial surface water until
wells were excavated on ridge summits.
A 100 percent pedestrian inspection of the project area was conducted using visual
examination and shovel testing. Surface inspection included a visual examination of the areas
with exposed soil surfaces in a continuous effort between shovel tests along the right-of-way.
Shovel testing was conducted in accordance with the Texas Historic Commission’s guidelines
for cultural resources surveys. According to these guidelines, linear project areas require a
minimum of ten tests per kilometer or 16 tests per mile. Shovel testing included excavating an
area approximately 30 cm (12 inches) in diameter in 10 cm (4 inch) levels down to the clay
substrate or 90 cm (35 inches). The excavated matrix was screened through a 0.635 cm (0.25
inch) wire mesh screen. The depth, soil type, and color of each shovel test were recorded.
For each archaeological site revisited or new cultural resource, DETAC completed several
field procedures. Initially, the right-of-way near the site area was intensely inspected and shovel
tests were placed along the right-of-way to define the spatial boundaries and vertical depth of the
deposits of the site within the area of proposed effect. Shovel tests were documented as part of the
normal survey with GPS locations accurate to 3 m (10 ft). Artifacts from positive shovel tests were
collected by level with reference to the site number and level. All information was recorded on a
standard Texas Archaeological Site Form (TexSite v. 2.0).

Field sketch maps showing the

relationship between the new pipeline, DETAC shovel tests, and the site boundaries were
completed for all sites where artifacts were recovered.

RESULTS
The Texas Archaeological Site Atlas (THC 2008) was consulted for the locations of known
or potential NRHP properties in accordance with the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966
(PL 89-665) as amended in 1974 (PL 94-442) and 1981 (PL 96-515). Each description includes the
topographic setting, previously recorded sites and surveys, reclaimed land from lignite mining,
vegetation, soils, shovel test information and documented sites.

Section 1
The section along F.M. 127 extends roughly 770 m (2526 ft) adjacent to the road rightof-way (Figure 2). The only previous archaeological work along the segment is the survey by
Perttula and Nelson (2005) which crosses F.M. 127 at the point where the pipeline will turn
south and leave the road. Sites within a mile of the section include 41TT824, 41TT855, and
41TT865 which are discussed with Section 2.
Buried cables parallel the roadway and residential driveways separated by small pastures
cross the proposed pipeline right-of-way. Vegetation along the right-of-way is predominantly
pasture isolated stands of mixed pine and hardwood forest.

Soils along the section were

described as Freestone series over most of the section with Woodtell series soils at the western
portion of the section. The upland soil series have varying depths because of the modern
impacts, but all contain sandy and loamy sediments over clay.
A total of eight tests (ST 95 through 102 in Appendix A) were excavated in pastures
while avoiding buried cables and leveled areas for driveways and houses. Shovel tests depth
ranged from 30 to 60 cm (12 to 24 inches) in thick A horizons over light brown sandy loam and
clay. No cultural material was found in the surface inspection or shovel testing effort across the
section. Based on the negative findings along the section, DETAC requests concurrence with a
determination of “no effect” to NRHP eligible cultural resources for the segment; no further
work is recommended.

Section 2
This section extends roughly 2.1 km (1.3 miles) across upland ridges with pastures
separated by forested drainages from F.M. 127 to the junction of the pipelines (Figure 2). This

section is entirely within the area surveyed by Perttula and Nelson (2005). Their investigations
revisited or documented eight sites near the northern half of the proposed pipeline: 41TT6, 824,
846, 847, 848, 855, 856, and 861. An additional four sites are located near the southern end, but
they are described with Section 4. Three sites, 41TT6, 41TT847 and 41TT855 have boundaries
within 100 m (330 ft) of the proposed pipeline. Of these three sites, 41TT847 is roughly 90 m
(295 ft) west of the pipeline while 41TT855 and 41TT6 have site boundaries in close proximity
to the proposed pipeline. Each of these eight sites is described below with regards to site type,
spatial relationship to the proposed pipeline, description from site forms and survey reports, and
recommendations for further work.
Site 41TT6, Thomas Cladwell site, is a Caddoan cemetery located on the slope and
summit of a wide ridge overlooking the Tankersley Creek floodplain. The site was initially
excavated in 1934 by Goldschmidt to reveal 10 interments with no other features associated with
a habitation (Thurmond 1990:180). More recently, Nelson (2002) revised the site boundaries
with seven positive of eleven shovel tests excavated along the long axis of the ridge. Artifacts
recovered were limited to lithic debitage found as deep as 40 cmbs (16 inches below surface).
The revised site boundary places the site along the proposed pipeline according to the Site Atlas
(2008); however, the Goldschmidt map in Perttula and Nelson (2005:54 Figure 6) suggest the
excavated interment were most likely west of the proposed pipeline. Also, a review of the site
sketch map (Nelson 2002) shows six of the seven positive tests west of the proposed pipeline and
only one positive test east of the proposed pipeline. Perttula and Nelson (2005:29 Table 1)
recommended stripping the area in search of features. In 2008, Prewitt and Associates, Inc.
conducted 131 auger tests and 26 backhoe trenches across the site (Fields 2008). The augering
found shallow soils with between 10 and 50 cm of sandy loam over clay and only five flakes in
two of 39 tests on the northern half of the site.
Site 41TT824 is a small prehistoric site on the shoulder of an upland ridge recorded
during a survey of the F.M. 127 bridge for TxDot (Gadus 2000) roughly 260 m west of the
pipeline. Gadus excavated a total of five shovel tests to over 100 cmbs recovering a Yarbrough
dart point and lithic debris mixed with modern glass in three of the tests excavated on the
landform. Perttula and Nelson (2005:29 Table 1) revised the site and determined that no further
work was necessary.

16

Site 41TT846, Cladwell “T” site, is a multi-component Archaic/Late Prehistoric site on
the summit and slope a wide ridge overlooking Tankersley creek roughly 130 m (425 ft) west of
the proposed pipeline. Nelson (2002) found artifacts in 17 of 23 shovel tests and recovered lithic
and ceramic artifacts down to 40 cmbs. Some confusion exists if this is the actual location of
41TT6, regardless Perttula and Nelson (2005:29 Table 1) determined that testing was necessary.
Site 41TT847, the J.M. Crabb site, is an open camp site located on an isolated ridge
overlooking the Tankersley Creek floodplain roughly 100 m (330 ft) west of the proposed
pipeline. Nelson (2002) excavated 20 shovel tests of which 14 were positive recovering lithic
debris and fire cracked rock although an informant suggested ceramics were recovered from the
site. Shovel tests extended to 100 cmbs. Perttula and Nelson (2005:29 Table 1) determined that
backhoe trenching was necessary to explore the depth of the cultural material.
Site 41TT848, V.F. Copeland site, is a lithic scatter located on an isolated knoll at the toe
slope of an upland ridge roughly 120 m (395 ft) west of the pipeline. Nelson (2002) found lithic
debris in three of six shovel tests between 20 and 40 cmbs. Perttula and Nelson (2005:29 Table
1) determined that no further work was necessary.
Site 41TT855, P.P. Corp site, is a multi-component prehistoric/historic site on the summit
of an upland ridge overlooking Tankersley Creek (Nelson 2002). Of 18 tests on the site, 9 were
positive with lithic debris, whiteware, and brick fragments. Additionally, a pile of ironstones
were found and interpreted as a chimney fall. The site boundaries on the Site Atlas show the
proposed pipeline passing through the middle of the site. Perttula and Nelson (2005:29 Table 1)
determined that no further work was necessary.
Site 41TT856, C.S. Pipe site, is a prehistoric open camp on the toe slope of a ridge in the
Tankersley Creek floodplain. Nelson (2002) found artifacts in 3 of 4 shovel tests and recovered
lithic debris between 20 and 40 cmbs in tests that extended to 85 cmbs and he describes the site
as being much larger than the area shovel tested. Shovel testing was limited by poultry fertilizer
spread on the surface. Perttula and Nelson (2005:29 Table 1) determined that testing was
necessary.
Site 41TT861, Jas Baggerman site, is a Caddoan open camp site on the slope of a upland
ridge roughly 240 m west of the pipeline. Nelson (2002) found lithic debris in 15 of 19 shovel
tests down to 20 cmbs. Shovel testing was limited by poultry fertilizer spread on the surface.
Perttula and Nelson (2005:29 Table 1) determined that testing was necessary.
17

To summarize the previously recorded sites along the segment, one site, 41TT6, was
recorded and excavated in 1934 (Goldschmidt), one site, 41TT824 was documented by Gadus
(2000) and revised by Nelson (2002), seven more sites, 41TT846, 847, 848, 855, 856, and 861
were recorded by Nelson (2002) along a proposed Bypass corridor. Of all eight sites, further
work was recommended on four sites (41TT6, 846, 847, and 856).

One of the sites

recommended for further work, 41TT6, will be impacted by the proposed pipeline, but testing by
Prewitt and Associates did not recover significant artifacts or features near the proposed
pipeline.
Vegetation along the section varies from mature mixed hardwood and pine forest along
the three streams drawn on the topographic map to open pasture on ridge summits. Soils along
the section are Woodtell series along the ridge summits and slopes with Nahatche series in the
low-lying areas. Although the section was previously surveyed, shovel testing was conducted at
intervals consistent with the standards described by the Texas Historic Commission because the
survey by Perttula and Nelson focused on high probability areas only (2005:51). Shovel tests
outside previously recorded sites found shallow soils on ridge slopes and summits with 20 to 40
cm of sandy loam over clay and 10 to 20 cm of clay loam in the floodplains and drainage
crossings (Appendix A, ST 36 – 43, 49 – 58). One ridge summit was not shovel tested
adequately as the summit was covered in a recent deposit of liquid waist from a poultry facility.
Shovel testing at 41TT6 included five tests across the ridge and along the proposed
pipeline (Figure 3). No artifacts were found in tests that ranged from 10 cm of reddish brown
gravely sandy loam to 30 cm of light brown sandy loam. These findings concur with the auger
testing by Prewitt. The disturbance noted on the Nelson (2002) sketch map extends north of the
fence, as evidenced in the shovel tests, and eastward to the dam with what appears to be cutting
and smoothing of the area. It is assumed that the removed material was used in the construction
of a dam but it may also be replacement soil from the Goldschmidt excavations in 1934. The
auger testing and backhoe trenching by Prewitt and Associates clearly shows the artifact
distribution on this portion of the landform is limited in both number and distribution to the area
south of the fence and west of the proposed pipeline (Fields 2008). Also, the sludge noted on the
Nelson (2002) sketch map is now on the ridge north of the site, limiting shovel testing along the

pipeline. As stated in Perttula and Nelson (2005:53), it is uncertain where the Goldschmidt
excavations were located precisely; however, using the contour lines and the excavation area on
the Goldschmidt map provided in Perttula and Nelson (2005:54 Figure 6), the shovel test data
from Nelson (2002), and the current investigations, it appears that the Goldschmidt excavations
were west of the proposed pipeline. The shovel test data from Nelson (2002) also suggest the
bulk of the site is west of the proposed pipeline as doest the auger data from Prewitt. Because of
the work by Perttula and Nelson (2005:29 Table 1) and Prewitt (2008), DETAC requests
concurrence with a determination of “no effect” for the proposed right-of-way.
Shovel testing at 41TT855 included six tests excavated across the ridge along the
proposed pipeline (Figure 4). Shovel testing found 10 to 30 cm of brown and light brown sandy
loam near the shoulder slopes of the ridge and exposed red clay at the ridge crest. Rusting farm
equipment was observed southwest of the right-of-way, but no artifacts were found in the shovel
tests. DETAC concurs with the recommendation by Perttula and Nelson (2005:29 Table 1) that
no further work was necessary.
To summarize Section 2, shovel testing and visual examination near previously recorded
sites did not find any artifacts or cultural features. The pipeline will pass through site 41TT6 as
recorded on the Site Atlas. Excavations on 41TT6 by Goldschmidt uncovered ten burials but no
maps could be reliably georefrenced to the landform or current project area. The shovel testing
by Perttula and Nelson (2005) and work by Prewitt (Fields 2008) found no artifacts in the
vicinity of the proposed pipeline right-of-way. Shovel testing on 41TT855 were unsuccessful in
finding artifacts. DETAC concurs with the recommendation for no further work by Perttula and
Nelson (2005:29) and Prewitt (Fields 2008) because of the negative results on 41TT6. Negative
shovel tests along the remainder of the pipeline right-of-way support Perttula and Nelson (2005)
selection of high probability areas. DETAC requests concurrence with a determination of “no
effect” to cultural resources for Section 2 because the project plans have been amended to
include boring under 41TT6.

Section 3
Section 3 extends roughly 1000 m (3280 ft) from the junction of the pipelines to a
connection with an existing waterline near Highway 271 along the highest upland ridge
separating Tankersley and Hart Creeks (Figure 5).

include two linear surveys and two area surveys. The linear surveys are a survey along Hwy 271
in 1985 for FHWA and a survey for a pipeline that crosses Hwy 271 roughly 150 m northeast of
the pipeline (Galan 2001). No sites documented near the project area for either survey. Area
surveys include a wide corridor between Hwy 271 and the southern end of the Perttula and
Nelson (2005) survey, no sites were recorded (Cliff 2007), but the southern end of the Perttula
and Nelson (2005) survey documented sites 41TT849, 850, 859, and 862 between 40 and 100 m
of the proposed pipeline.
Sites 41TT849, V.M. Prefert site, is a multi-component prehistoric/historic site with lithic
debris, glass shards, and brick fragments. Nelson (2002) found artifacts in 10 of 15 shovel tests
excavated across the site and noted a barn visible on the topographic map as well as several
buried utility lines, agricultural activity and the paved drive way in the site area. Nearby site
41TT850, S. Runway site, consists of modern historic debris removed in construction of
driveway and modern dwellings west of the site location (Nelson 2002).

The boundary for

41TT849 is roughly 100 m (330 ft) west of the proposed pipeline and 41TT850 is roughly 40 m
(130 ft) west of the proposed pipeline. Both sites were considered ineligible for inclusion to the
NRHP by Perttula and Nelson (2005:29 Table 1) with no further work necessary.
Site 41TT862, E. Priefert site, is an Archaic camp site roughly 100 m (330 ft) west of the
section on an isolated ridge in a hay pasture. Artifacts recovered include lithic debitage and fire
cracked rock found to 60 cmbs in four of seven shovel tests with landowners collecting dart
points from the surface (Nelson 2002). Perttula and Nelson (2005:29 Table 1) determined that
testing was necessary.
Visual inspection along Section 3 reveled the pipeline will pass through a large hay
pasture with none of the structures visible on the topographic map standing today. The pipeline
will pass through a low draw with mature hardwood trees with light understory or bushes and
shrubs along a draw near the northwest end of the section and an isolated stand of hardwood
trees with pasture grasses near the southeast end of the section. Soils are limited to Woodtell
fine sandy loam over clay with a deep disturbed A horizon from turning the soil over in the
reencet past as part of the raizing of the old buildings and preparing the area for pasture. A total
of 10 shovel tests (ST 26 through 35) were excavated along the length of the segment and an
additional ten tests were excavated near site 41TT903 (described below). Shovel tests along the
right-of-way found 30 to 60 cm of reddish brown sandy loam.
23

41TT903
Site 41TT903 is the location of a historic period house on the summit of the large upland
ridge separating Hart and Tankersley creeks. Vegetation is limited to pasture grasses with five
mature hardwood trees surrounding the site. The house is present on the topographic map as a
black rectangle, but the only surface expression of the house today is the remains of an asphalt
driveway and the raised pad for the house. The pad is roughly 15 to 20 cm above the adjacent
ground surface.
Shovel testing on 41TT903 focused on determining the impact to the site by the proposed
pipeline, understanding the potential for intact buried features, and establishing an age of the
house based on the artifacts.

To this end, shovel tests were excavated on a 10 m grid

overlapping the proposed pipeline and the raised house platform (Figure 6). Shovel tests were
excavated to the Bt horizon roughly 60 cm (24 inches) below the ground surface. Soils observed
in the tests were uniform with light brown sandy loam between 50 and 70 cm (20 and 28 inches)
deep. ST 7 penetrated the raised pad to reveal mottled red and yellow clay 20 cm deep located
directly under the grass and over undisturbed E and Bt horizons. Six of the ten tests excavated
were positive with artifacts found down to 30 cm (12 inches) below the ground surface.
Artifacts found in shovel tests include an undecorated plain whiteware sherd, two
machine-made brick fragments, five wire nails, two aluminum screw bottle tops, a wire segment,
and one glass shard.
The landowner, Bill Prefert, was contacted about the house (2007). He said the house
was built in the 1940's or 1950's. It was rented to several individuals over the next 30 years then
was moved off site. No further work is recommended on 41TT903 because of the recent age of
the house from the recovered artifacts and description by Mr. Prefert, the removal of the house
from the location, and the placement of the proposed pipeline in relation to the house pad.
To summarize Section 3, shovel testing and visual examination near previously recorded
sites 41TT849 and 41TT862 did not find any artifacts or cultural features. The pipeline will pass
near site 41TT903, which is similar to 41TT849 in association with modern activity on the ridge
and considered not eligible for inclusion to the NRHP or further work by Perttula and Nelson
(2005:29). Negative shovel tests along the remainder of the section support a request for “no
effect” to cultural resources for Section 3.

Section 4
This section extends roughly 2.0 km (1.25 miles) from the junction of the pipelines on an
upland ridge, across the toe slopes of two ridges, and ends at Tankersley Creek (Figure 7).
Perttula and Nelson (2005) describe the survey and documentation of sites 41TT862, 863, 866,
and 867 near the northern end of the section. Three other sites, 41TT888, 889, and 890 were
recorded by Nelson (2008) not related to a reviewed archaeological survey. Of these seven sites,
four are within 200 m (660 ft) of the proposed pipeline. The four sites, 41TT863, 866, 867, and
890 are described below with regards to site type, spatial relationship to the proposed pipeline,
description from site forms and survey reports, and recommendations for further work.
Site 41TT863, M.A. Copeland site, is a Caddoan open camp site on the toe slope of an
upland ridge in the Tankersley Creek floodplain roughly 75 m (245 ft) northwest and down slope
of the proposed pipeline. Nelson (2002) found ceramic sherds and lithic debetage in six of ten
shovel tests down to 40 cmbs. Perttula and Nelson (2005:29 Table 1) determined that testing
was necessary.
Site 41TT866, W.D. Priefert site, is a multi-component prehistoric/historic site on the
summit of a wide upland ridge over looking the Tankersley Creek floodplain. The proposed
pipeline passes along the northern and western boundaries of the site. Nelson (2002) found
prehistoric ceramics, lithic debetage, and fire cracked rock along with historic period tools,
whiteware, nails, and brick fragments in 15 of 17 shovel tests down to 60 cmbs. Perttula and
Nelson (2005:29 Table 1) determined that testing was necessary.
Site 41TT867, Copel and Priefert site, is a multi-component Archaic/Caddoan site on a
terrace remnant in the Tankersley Creek floodplain 140 m (460 ft) west of the proposed pipeline.
Nelson (2002) found ceramics, lithic debetage, dart points, and fire cracked rock down to 60
cmbs in 14 of 16 shovel tests. Perttula and Nelson (2005:29 Table 1) determined that testing was
necessary.
Site 41TT890, Priefert Mound site, is a multi-component Archaic/Caddo site with a
mound and Caddo Burials roughly 200 m (660 ft) west of the proposed pipeline (Nelson 2008).
Artifacts reported from the site include dart points, arrowpoints, lithic debitage, ceramic sherds,
whole vessels, and both human and non-human remains. The landowner has low areas of the
site cleared for drainage purposes, local pot hunters have stolen from the site, and floods from
the creek affect the site.

Current investigations along Section 4 found almost the entire section was in pasture with
stands of mature hardwood trees along the upland slopes.

Soils along the section included

upland ridges with Wolfpen loamy fine sand on the summit, Woodtell series soils on the slopes,
Besner-Talco soils on the toe slopes, and either Nahatche loam or Estes clay loam in the low
areas along the drainages and in Tankersley Creek floodplain. A total of 53 shovel tests (ST 1
through 24, 63 through 77, 91 through 95, and 103 through 113) were excavated along the length
of the segment and an additional 26 tests were excavated in the vicinity of 41TT904, a Caddoan
open camp site documented along the proposed pipeline. Piled building debris was observed on
the ridge shoulder on 41TT866. Shovel testing near the site was along the slopes of the
landform. These test contained shallow dark reddish brown gravely sandy loam along the slopes
and deeper light brown sandy loam near the ridge summit. Shovel tests in the floodplain
contained mottled dark brown and gray silty clay loam. No artifacts were found near 41TT866.
A reroute of the pipeline was also surveyed in August 2009. The reroute placed the pipeline near
41TT863; however, the excavation of negative shovel tests show the proposed pipeline will not
impact the site.

Additionally, the visual examination of the reroute found the landform

containing the site is a low rise near the toe slope of a larger ridge. The pipeline will remain on
concave surfaces where grayer soils and more mesic vegetation which are all factors indicative
of surface water. Site 41TT863 will not be impacted by the proposed reroute.

41TT904
This site includes an artifact scatter on the toe slope and possible terrace remnant extending off a
larger upland ridge. This elevated area is defined by two intermittent drainages north and south
of the landform. The toe slope/terrace remnant continues west-southwest to the modern creek
channel although the slope is significantly less west of the site. Vegetation is limited to pasture
grasses. A modern gravel road crosses the ridge to the east, and up hill, of the site. The crest of
the landform south of the artifact scatter was mechanically leveled in the past based on mottled
shallow soils found in shovel tests and an unnaturally level appearance. Soils on the site were
described as Woodtell fine sandy loam which range from 20 cm on the steeper slopes to roughly
70 cm deep further into the floodplain.

Incised sherd

Punctate sherd

Shovel testing was initiated along the right-of-way and expanded across the landform
(Figure 8). Additional tests were excavated along the summit of the ridge finding artifacts in 13
of 27 tests at depths between 20 and 40 cmbs. Shovel tests on the eastern portion of the site
were shallower and contained more gravel while shovel tests on the western portion of the site
were deeper and contained less gravel. Positive tests are divided into two separate clusters; one
at the eastern edge of the site on the toe slope of the ridge and on the western edge of the site on
an isolated level area that is either an extension of the toe slope or a terrace remnant.
Artifacts found on the site include 15 sherds, two biface fragments, three primary flakes,
four chips, one core, and one tested cobble (Appendix C). Of the 15 sherds, one is a brushed rim
sherd with punctuations (similar to Pease Brushed-Incised), one is an incised rim sherd (similar
to Duren Neck Banded or Dunkin Incised (Suhm and Jelks 1962:37, 39, and 118) and one is a
brushed body sherd. None of the lithics were diagnostic. Artifacts were found in levels 2, 3 and
4 throughout the site. No artifacts were found on the crest of the ridge and none were found
further down slope in the area that appears mechanically leveled. Based on two decorated rim
sherds less than 5 cm in size, the site is a late Caddoan occupation with utility wares as the only
evidence.
In summary, this site is a Late Prehistoric Caddo occupation on the toe slope and possible
terrace remnant in the Tankersley Creek floodplain. The site may be larger than shovel testing
delineated and may be connected to 41TT890; however, constraints prohibited further
exploration. This portion of the floodplain was also subject to clearing and bulldozing in the
20th century which may have destroyed shallower deposits and displaced artifacts from their
original place of deposition. Based on the shovel tests results, the pipeline will pass roughly 20
m (65 ft) from the nearest positive test. Locations further to the west and on the summit of the
ridge to the east merit further shovel testing. Project plans were amended to include boring
under 41TT904. DETAC requests cultural resources clearance for the proposed pipeline along
the centerline. If the line is to deviate horizontally, than further investigations may be necessary.

To summarize Section 4, shovel testing and visual examination near previously recorded
sites 41TT866 did not find any artifacts or cultural features as most of the line will be on the
shoulder and slope of the landform. The pipeline will pass under site 41TT904, a late Caddoan
open camp site at the toe slope of a ridge. Negative tests near the pipeline centerline suggest no
30

cultural features will be impacted by the proposed pipeline near 41TT904. To insure no impact,
the pipeline will bore under the site. Negative shovel tests along the remainder of the section
support a request for “no effect” to cultural resources for Section 4 provided the line does not
deviate from the proposed centerline near 41TT904 and that the site is bored under.

Section 5
This section extends roughly 1.0 km (0.6 miles) from the pipeline crossing at Tankersley
Creek westward to the Water Treatment Facility (Figure 9) surveyed by Galan (2007); no sites
were documented by the survey. In addition to the survey for the Water Treatment Facility, the
proposed pipeline will cross a powerline right-of-way survey for SWEPCO (Carpenter and
Drake 1994). Two sites were recorded as small lithic scatters found on the surface more than
400 m (1315 ft) south of the proposed pipeline. Neither was recommended for further work.
The modern setting for the segment varies from mature hardwood trees, moderate to
dense understory and shin high grasses near the Water Treatment Facility to a large cleared area
covering roughly 750 m (2460 ft) of the proposed pipeline between Tankersley Creek and a
fence line 500 m (1640 ft) east of the Water Treatment Facility. At the time of the survey, the
area was cleared of all vegetation and bulldozed to smooth contours. Soils varied, according to
the soil survey, with upland ridges of Woodtell series soils while low areas along the drainages
had Nahatche loam. The modern clearing and smoothing of the area spread soils to an almost
uniform 30 cm of light brown sandy loam on the western half of the section and more light
grayish brown clay loam on the eastern half of the section. Shovel testing and visual inspection
of the cleared area along the proposed pipeline failed to recover artifacts (ST 79 through 89 in
Appendix A). Based on the negative findings along the section and the disturbance by modern
clearing and smoothing, DETAC requests concurrence with a determination of “no effect” to
NRHP eligible cultural resources for the segment; no further work is recommended.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The proposed City of Mt. Pleasant water pipeline project consists of 7.5 km (4.7 miles) of
pipeline in a right-of-way 15 m (50 ft) wide. All of the corridor will be new construction
planned to follow the Mt. Pleasant Bypass for most of the distance from the southeast to the
northwest with a line extending to the proposed Water Treatment Facility west of Tankersley
Creek. Of the length of the pipeline, 2.8 km (1.7 miles) was within previously surveyed areas for
the Bypass. The Bypass survey by Perttula and Nelson (2005) revisited two sites and recorded
12 sites. Of these 14 sites, the proposed pipeline will pass through or near 41TT6, 41TT855, and
41TT866. Sites 41TT6 and 41TT866 were recommended for further testing.
Section 1 parallels F.M. 127 and is adjacent to buried cables and driveways separated by
small pastures. Shovel testing found highly disturbed soils between residences. No artifacts or
cultural features were found.
Section 2 crosses three upland ridges with pastures separated by forested drainages. This
section is entirely within the area surveyed by Perttula and Nelson (2005). The proposed pipeline
will impact sites 41TT6 and 41TT855. Site 41TT6 was excavated by Goldschmidt in 1934,
additional shovel testing was conducted by Perttula and Nelson (2005), and testing was conducted
by Prewitt and Associates in 2008 (Fields 2008). The site sketch map (Nelson 2002) shows six of
the seven positive tests west of the proposed pipeline and only one positive test east of the
proposed pipeline. Auger testing by Perwitt found less than five artifacts in 19 auger tests along
the proposed corridor. Finally, no artifacts were found in the current shovel testing effort. Because
of the negative results in three separate efforts, DETAC requests that no further work be conducted
along the right-of-way; however, project plans now include boring under the site (Appendix D).
Shovel testing on 41TT855 also did not find artifacts, DETAC concurs with the recommendation
by Perttula and Nelson (2005:29 Table 1) that no further work was necessary on 41TT855.
Segment 3 extends from the junction of the pipelines to a connection with an existing
waterline near Highway 271. Shovel testing along the segment found 41TT903, a historic period
house site, near the eastern end of the pipeline. Artifacts and an interview with the landowner
revealed the house was built in the latter part of the twentieth century before it was removed.
DETAC request concurrence with a determination of “no effect” to significant cultural resources
for the segment.
33

Section 4 extends from the pipeline junction in the uplands and extends westward to
Tankersley Creek. One previously recorded site, 41TT866, is circumvented by the pipeline.
Shovel testing failed to find any artifacts near 41TT866. Shovel testing did find 41TT904, a
Caddoan occupation of the toe slope and possible terrace remnant on the valley margin of
Tankersley Creek floodplain. Shovel testing on 41TT904 found artifact in the upper 40 cmbs in
two clusters east and west of the proposed pipeline by 20 m (65 ft). DETAC requests cultural
resources clearance for the proposed pipeline along the centerline. If the line is to deviate
horizontally, then further investigations may be necessary. Construction plans have changed to
include boring under 41TT904.
Section 5 connects a recently surveyed Water Treatment Facility to Section 4. Visual
inspection revealed the section was highly disturbed by recent clearing and smoothing of the terrain
west of Tankersley Creek. Shovel testing along the segment failed to find cultural resources.
DETAC requests concurrence with a determination of “no effect” to NRHP eligible cultural
resources for the segment; no further work is recommended.
With the avoidance of sites 41TT6 and 41TT904 by boring under both sites, DETAC
requests a determination of “no effect” to properties listed or eligible for listing to the National
Register of Historic Places and to the State Archaeological Landmarks.
