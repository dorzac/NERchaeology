ABSTRACT
Encore Multi-Family, LLC of Dallas, Texas intends to construct the
Encore on Pleasant Grove Apartments, Texarkana, in Bowie County,
Texas. Since this project is a HUD development on private property, the
Texas Historical Commission recommended that an archaeological survey
be conducted to identify any historic properties within the project area or
its vicinity. A survey was conducted by AR Consultants Inc. on December
7 and 8, 2010. No cultural resources were located on the surface or in 20
shovel tests excavated within the 10-acre project area. Based on the
negative results of the survey, no cultural resources will be impacted by
the construction of the Pleasant Grove Apartments. Consequently, further
cultural resource investigations are unwarranted and AR Consultants, Inc.
recommends that the Texas Historical Commission concur with this
assessment. If buried cultural deposits are discovered during the
development of the study area, work should immediately cease in that area
and the Texas Historical Commission should be notified.

INTRODUCTION
Encore Multi-Family, LLC (Encore) intends to construct the Encore on Pleasant Grove
Apartments in northwestern Texarkana, Bowie County, Texas. The proposed
development is located on a single tract of land with a total acreage of 10 acres. The tract
is located on the west side of Pleasant Grove Road approximately 2250’ north of its
terminus at IH 30 on the west side of Texarkana (Figure 1).
In accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, the
Texas Historical Commission recommended survey in a letter dated November 10, 2010,
to identify historic properties that may be adversely affected by this development in
compliance with 36 CFR 800 (Appendix A). Encore contracted with AR Consultants,
Inc. to conduct the archaeological survey and produce a report of investigations. The
development is on private property; therefore an Antiquities Permit was not needed for
the archaeological survey.
This report was written in accordance with the guidelines prepared by the Council of
Texas Archeologists [no date (n.d.)]. The following report presents a brief description of
the natural environment and the cultural history of the region. This is followed by a
description of the research design and methodology. The results of the investigation
follow and constitute the body of the report. The last chapter presents recommendations
that arise from the study and a list of references cited concludes the report.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
Bowie County is in the northeastern corner of Texas. The terrain ranges from level to
gently rolling. The Red River drains the northern portion of the county and the Sulphur
River the southern. Most of the soils are loamy or clayey (Harper 2007:1)
The study area is located in the Mixed Pine-Hardwood Forest in the Piney Woods of
northeast Texas (Diamond, Riskind, and Orzell 1987: Figure 1) which is characterized as
an oak-hickory-pine forest. Major timber trees are longleaf-slash pine, loblolly-shortleaf
pine, oak, hickory, and sweet gum. Oak-gum-cypress, elm-oak-cottonwood, sycamore,
willow, and other hardwood associations are found in the low, wet bottomlands.
Understory vegetation includes green briar, sumac, poison ivy, yaupon, crape myrtle,
dogwood, and many other species.
The majority of the study area is underlain by the undivided Midway Group which is a
Paleocene-aged formation consisting primarily of clay, with some sand, silt, calcareous
siltstone concretions, and thin beds of limestone (Bureau of Economic Geology 1966).
The proposed development is situated in the Sawyer-Eylau-Woodtell soil association
which consists of gently sloping upland loams (Fox 1980: General Soil Map). Individual
soils include the Adaton-Muskogee complex, Eylau very fine sandy loam with 0 to 3
percent slopes, Ruston fine sandy loam with 1 to 3 percent slopes Sawyer silt loam with 0
to 3 percent slopes (Fox 1980: Map 34). These soils are associated with gently undulating
upland settings.
Fauna are varied and abundant with at least 47 species of mammals, 39 species of
reptiles, and 17 amphibious species present (Blair 1950:99). Common forms include
deer, raccoons, bears, opossums, rabbits, beavers, lizards, and turtles. Armadillos have
invaded the area within the past 50 years.
A general paleoenvironmental reconstruction is presented by Linder-Linsley and Lindsay
(1997:30-31). Prior to 30,000 years ago, moist conditions might have been present in an
oak-hickory-pine forest zone. From circa 23,000 to 16,500 years ago, the climate was
much cooler and more mesic than today. The climate became persistently cooler between
16,500 to 12,500 years ago based upon the presence of mesic flora and the mesic flora
dominated the landscape from 12,500 to 8,500 years ago. Prairies occurred in East Texas
from 8,500 to 4,000 years ago due to the warming and drying trend during the
Altithermal. The dominant tree type appeared to be the southern pine. There is a general
lack of information in East Texas from 8,500 years ago today, but it is generally believed
that around 3,500 years ago, the conditions were moister and between 950 and 700 years
ago, drought conditions were present. Pines were present probably at least 1,200 years
ago. From 700 years ago to today, the climate has changed very little.

CULTURAL HISTORY
Cultural resources studies in Bowie County have primarily been the result of lake
construction and community development. Lake Wright Patman (formerly Lake
Texarkana) has been the major location of archaeological investigations in the area along
the Sulphur River (Briggs and Malone 1970; Jelks 1961). Other work has been done at
Writght Patman Lake and Lake O’ the Pines (Linder-Linsley and Lindsay 1997; Hunt and
Cliff 1998). Survey has been conducted in the area of the Red River Army Depot and the
Lone Star Army Ammunition Plant (Cliff and Peter 1991), and recent work has been
done at the Hatchel site (Perttula and Nelson 2003) and the Weaver Creek site (Lohse
2005). The following culture history is derived from these sources, and others listed in
the references cited portion of the report.
The earliest occupation appears to have been by 10,000 B.C., based on the presence of
fluted Clovis and Folsom dart points (Meltzer and Bever 2007:67). These and other
finely crafted projectiles have been recovered in numerous places but always on the
surface of the ground or in mixed contexts. They have yet to be discovered in a primary
context. Aboriginal occupation continued through the successive centuries, but the
evidence is scattered and more teasing than substantive before A.D. 1.
The Archaic, which is divided into Early, Middle and Late, ranges from ca. 8,000 to 200
B.C. Darts and the atlatl were used for hunting. Riverine sources were utilized based
upon the presence of net weights and sinkers. A new subsistence technology was
introduced which was heated stone cooking as evidenced by the appearance of burned
rock middens.
During the Early Ceramic/Woodland period (circa 200 B.C. to A.D. 800), the use of
ceramics occurred and by the end of the Woodland, the bow and arrow makes its
appearance. Floral resources appear to have been heavily utilized during this time period,
but the predominant life ways were similar to that of the Archaic.
The Caddoan occupation of East Texas has been divided into four phases, the Formative
(A.D. 800 to 1000), the Early (A.D. 1000 to 1200), the Middle (A.D. 1200-1400) and the
Late (A.D. 1400 to 1680). The Formative, Early and Middle peoples basically shared the
same life ways which consisted of hunting and gathering as well as raising corn and
squash. Exotic trade goods are present in the archaeological sites and there was an
explosion in the variety and complexity of the ceramic vessels. Temple and burial
mounds make their appearance and the larger sites were important civic/ceremonial
centers containing multiple mounds. This life way continued through Late Caddoan
times, but there appears to be an abandonment of the larger sites along rivers and
farmsteads become more apparent along drainages, possibly due to dryer climate. The
Historic Caddoan period (AD 1680 to 1860) is marked by the presence of European trade
goods, but the Late Caddoan life way continued.
Freeman and Custis were dispatched by President Jackson to explore East Texas in 1806
but were turned back by the Spanish at Spanish Bluff which is located almost due north

of New Boston. This is the only recorded evidence of early Europeans near the study area
(Harper 2007:1).
By 1818, the area was colonized by American settlers, who turned to Mexico for aid
when the federal government refused them land titles. Bowie County was established in
1840, and named after James Bowie, and Boston was selected as the county seat in 1841.
The early settlers were largely individual farmers who held small property holdings and
supported themselves on a grain and livestock economy. These subsistence farmers grew
corn and other vegetables; cotton and wheat became more prominent over time.
Commercial cotton production began in the 1830s and cotton was shipped to the Gulf
Coast through Jefferson until rail lines replaced water travel after the Civil War. Bowie
County residents were hard hit by the Great Depression but manufacturing in the area did
not feel the pressure until late into the 1930s. World War II, obviously, affected the
people but it also brought prosperity with the construction of the Lone Star Ammunition
Plant and Red River Army Depot. Also, the petroleum industry made an impact upon the
economic base in the late 1949s. Another marked change was in the population shift.
Urban areas began to grow while the number of farms and ranches declined as a result of
the importance of manufacturing jobs to the populace. Today, although only one sizable
city (Texarkana) is present, Bowie County continues to grow population wise and
economically based upon the presence of farming and ranching, manufacturing, logging
and, to a degree, the petroleum industry (Harper 2007:2-7).
Previous Investigations
Bowie County has been extensively surveyed. The first major survey was for the
proposed Texarkana Reservoir on the Sulphur River (Stephenson 1950). Seventeen
village areas were recorded and eleven of those were recommended for excavation. Jelks
(1961) returned and excavated three mound sites, the Knight’s Bluff, the Snipes and the
Sherwin. Various types of pottery, projectile points and other lithic tools as well as
jewelry were recovered. The Texarkana Reservoir was surveyed again when the lake was
enlarged (Briggs and Malone 1970).
Several thousand acres adjacent to the Lake O’the Pines and Lake Wright Patman
(formerly Lake Texarkana) were investigated by various cultural resources companies
(White, Hunt and Cliff 1995; Cliff, Hunt, Pleasant, Proctor and Ensor 1996;LinderLinsley and Lindsay 1997; Cliff and Hunt 1998a and 1998b; Hunt and Cliff 1998; Hunt,
Everette and Borrego 2002; Trierweller and Jones 2005 and 2006). Numerous
archaeological sites were recorded and ranged from Archaic lithic scatters to Historic
farmsteads. Several of the sites were recommended for testing to determine their
ineligibility for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places (NHRP)
Over 5,000 acres were surveyed for the White Oak Creek area (Cliff 1993; Cliff, White,
Hunt, Pleasant and Shaw 1996). At least 57 prehistoric sites were recorded and four
multi-component which ranged to historic times. One site, 41BW559, was tested in order
to determine its eligibility for nomination to the NHRP. The site had been occupied from
approximately 200 B.C. to A.D. 1680 which ranges from the Late Archaic to the Late
Caddo periods. Avoidance of the site was recommended due to its potential to provide

significant information to the prehistory of Bowie County and was deemed eligible for
nomination to the NHRP.
Over 25,000 acres were surveyed for the Red River Army Depot and Lone Star
Ammunition Plant (Cliff and Peter 1988, 1991; Peter and Cliff 1990, 1990, 1994; Hunt
1992; Gadus and Freeman 1998). Over a hundred archaeological sites ranging in age
from the Paleo-Indian to historic times were recorded and range from prehistoric lithic
scatters to historic farmsteads and trash dumps. Two sites, 41BW182, a multi-component
site that ranged from Paleo-Indian to historic times, and 41BW183, an Archaic lithic
scatter, were tested for eligibility to the NHRP and as SALs. The lack of stratigraphic
integrity, low artifact density, and the general absence of diagnostic artifacts made the
sites ineligible.
Archeological and Environmental Consultants, LLC (AEC) investigated site 41BW3,
otherwise known as the Hatchel site (Perttula and Nelson 2003). Five different village
areas with intact cultural deposits were uncovered that range in age from approximately
AD 1200 to the late 17th century. One village site may have been occupied when the
mound was not being constructed. Perttula (2005a) provides some insight into the early
excavations of the site.
Several surveys of parks, pipeline routes, electrical transmission lines, wastewater
treatment plants have been conducted in Bowie County (for example, Skinner 1989,
1995; Perttula and Blaine 1998; Trask and Skinner 1999; Perttula 2005b) but failed to
find many archaeological sites. Several sites such as 41BW 318, 410, 422 and 692
(Wormser 1991, 1992; Tucker 2001; Lohse 2005), were excavated but were not eligible
for nomination to the NHRP.
A search of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) reveals that relatively few
surveys have been conducted in the immediate vicinity of the study area (TASA 2010).
The only survey conducted within a mile of the proposed development is a linear survey
carried out for the EPA in 1981, which failed to locate any archaeological sites. However,
in 2004 AEC conducted an extensive survey of 425 acres at Bringle Lake, located
approximately 1.5 miles to the northeast of the study area (Perttula and Nelson 2005a).
Eleven sites (41BW695 through 41BW705) were recorded during the survey, and range
in age from prehistoric lithic scatters to historic artifact scatters and homesteads. The
Wright site (41BW703), a historic farmstead dating to between 1880 and 1910, was later
tested for eligibility for inclusion on the NRHP (Perttula and Nelson 2005b). As the site
was serially occupied for 30 years by three unrelated families, the occupations could not
be distinguished in the archaeological record, and precise dating of the site was
impossible. Accordingly, the site was not deemed eligible for inclusion on the NRHP.
A review of historic maps of Bowie County located structures plotted near the current
study area. A single occupied structure is mapped near the study area on both the 1920
Bowie County Soils Map and the 1940 General Highway Map of Bowie County (USDA
1920 and Texas State Highway Department 1940). These correspond to the location of
structures mapped to the north of the study area on the 1954 Texarkana, TX-AR 7.5’
USGS map, which was photorevised in 1975

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
Research Design
Two research questions were developed regarding the potential for or existence of
prehistoric and historic sites in the study area. In regard to prehistoric sites, the study area
exhibits fairly low archaeological potential. Previous investigations in the region suggest
that potential for prehistoric archaeological sites is highest near perennial water sources.
Given that the current study area is situated in the gently sloping upland edge remote
from significant drainages, the potential is considered low.
The second research question addresses historic site potential in the region. There is
potential for historic sites since the region has been occupied and utilized by European
Settlers since the mid-1800s. This potential is buttressed by the location of the study area
along a historic roadway, and the presence of structures plotted near the study area on
historic maps of Bowie County. This potential is highest in the eastern edge of the study
area along Pleasant Grove Road.
Methodology
Field personnel walked parallel transects spaced approximately 30 meters apart, making
thorough notes about the ground exposure, soil types, and disturbed areas. Shovel tests
were excavated in relatively undisturbed areas where ground visibility less than 30
percent, and followed the survey standards of 2 shovel tests for every 1 acre in a study
area measuring 10 acres or less, as recommended by the Texas Historical Commission
(n.d.). Each shovel test was excavated to the bottom of the Holocene deposits according
to THC standards. Shovel tests averaged 30 cm in diameter and were supplemented by an
auger where necessary. Sandy soils from the shovel tests were screened through ¼”
hardware cloth. The clay fill from the shovel tests was inspected visually and broken into
smaller chunks in order to determine if cultural materials were present. Shovel test
matrices were described on the basis of texture and color. The Munsell Soil Color Chart
was used to identify the specific soil colors in each shovel test. Photographs were taken
throughout the survey area using a Canon PowerShot SD1100 IS 8.0 mega pixel digital
camera. Shovel tests locations were recorded with a handheld Garmin GPSmap76 GPS
unit.

RESULTS
This chapter is separated into three sections, the first of which describes the terrain and
natural setting of the study area. The results of the survey follow, and conclusions derived
from the results end the chapter. Though shovel tests are described generally within the
text, a complete description can be found in Table 1.
Survey Area
The proposed development site is located on a ten-acre tract immediately west of
Pleasant Grove Road on an upland slope west of Wagner Creek (Figure 2).

Barbed wire fences form both the northern and eastern boundaries of the study area,
while the southern and western boundaries were easily discernable by the staked property
corners. Terrain in the study area is level to gently rolling (Figure 3), though small, very
low, isolated knolls sparsely dot the landscape. Elevations within the study area range
from 314’ asl in the low-lying northeast corner of the tract to 336’ asl in the rising
southern portion of the tract. Vegetation consists primarily of ankle to knee-high prairie
grasses which are kept low by substantial livestock grazing. Ground visibility was poor
however, and averaged between 10 and 30 percent. Several pine, oak and hickory trees
were present in the study area, though were mainly clustered along the fence lines.
However, isolated pines of advanced age were present within the study area, and appear
to have been purposefully left for some time, judging by their approximately 50-foot
height (Figure 4). A pair of north-south fence lines spaced roughly 150 feet apart are
located in the western third of the study area. The area between the two fences features
higher grasses, indicating that it is less frequently grazed than the surrounding pasture.

The Survey
A total of 20 shovel tests was excavated within the study area (Figure 5). Three were
excavated west of the two fence lines, four were excavated between them, and the
remaining 13 were excavated in the open pasture of the eastern two thirds of the study
area. Shovel tests were placed along transects spaced approximately 40 meters apart,
except between the two fences, where they were placed in a zig-zag pattern. Shovel tests
revealed a general soil profile consisting of brown and strong brown sandy loams
overlaying yellowish red sandy clay subsoil (Table 1). Subsoil was generally encountered
between 50 and 80 cm, though in a handful of shovel tests in the central portion of the
study area (06, 08, 09 and 10), subsoil was not reached, even when digging was
supplemented with the bucket auger. However, even in these tests, mottles of the
characteristic yellowish red sandy clay were seen amid the lightening reddish yellow
sandy loams and sandy clay loams.
Throughout the survey, isolated low rises and knolls were selected for shovel test
locations, though no cultural resources were observed there, or anywhere else on the
ground surface. Additionally, no cultural resources were recovered in any of the 20
shovel tests excavated within the study area, and despite the presence of structures plotted
near the study area on historic maps of Bowie County, no structures or structural remains
were observed within or adjacent to the study area. The structures seen on the historic
maps were found to correspond to the location of two structures, a house and a shed,
which are located approximately 100 feet north of the study area. These structures will
not be impacted by construction.

Conclusions
No cultural materials were seen on the ground surface or in 20 shovel tests during the
archaeological survey of the proposed Encore on Pleasant Grove Apartments study area.
This may be largely attributed to the study area’s relative dearth of significant water
sources. Based upon the Red River Army Depot archaeological survey, prehistoric sites
in this region appear to be tied to perennial drainages and also were found along
intermittent tributaries close to the perennial drainages. The lack of such drainages in the
upland study area accounts for the lack of archaeological material. The absence of
historic sites within the study area may be attributed to the fact that the land has been
continually used for pasturage since the area was settled, and therefore occupied
structures were never present on the property. The only structures present in proximity to
the study area are a house and a shed located approximately 100 feet north of the study
area. These will not be impacted by construction of the proposed Encore on Pleasant
Grove Apartments.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No archaeological sites or historic properties will be adversely affected by the
construction of the Encore on Pleasant Grove Apartments based on the negative results of
the cultural resource inventory. Consequently, further cultural resource investigations are
unwarranted. AR Consultants, Inc., therefore, requests that the THC concur with our
conclusions that this project can proceed without the need for additional cultural resource
investigations. If buried cultural resources are discovered during development, work
should immediately cease in that area and the THC should be notified immediately.
