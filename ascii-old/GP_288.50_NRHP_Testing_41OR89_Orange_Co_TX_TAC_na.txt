ABSTRACT

This report presents the results of eligibility testing for Site 41OR89 conducted by
HRA Gray & Pape, LLC, (HRA Gray & Pape) of Houston, Texas on behalf of AMEC
Paragon, Inc. of Houston, Texas, under contract with Golden Pass Pipeline LP (GPPL) for
the Golden Pass Pipeline Project.
Site 41OR89 is identified as a long-term cultural utilization locus situated on a
landform that was once adjacent to the paleochannel of the Neches River. While the site is
relatively small, it produced an abundance of prehistoric pottery, a diagnostic lithic projectile
point, and an intact thermal feature (Feature 1). Excavations across the landform indicate the
site deposit is intact. Site 41OR89 may once have shared the same landform as Site 41OR85,
a nearby prehistoric site determined eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP). Shovel testing, auger testing, and unit excavation during the intensive
pedestrian survey and subsequent eligibility-testing phase resulted in the recovery of 344
prehistoric artifacts (330 pottery sherds, 6 pieces of debitage, 1 diagnostic arrow point,
charcoal and silicified wood) as well as an intact thermal feature. Artifacts date from the
Clear Lake (100-425 A.D.) to the Round Lake (1000-1350 A.D.) cultural phases.
Investigations revealed that the site deposit is intact, although there is no evidence for deeply
buried strata. Based on these findings, HRA Gray & Pape recommends Site 41OR89 eligible
for nomination to the NRHP based on Criterion D.
Broad research themes that may be addressed by investigations at 41OR89 relate to
evidence in the archaeological record of variation in cultural interaction as represented by
ceramic use, technology, and, if present, evidence of pottery manufacture at the present-day
Texas/Louisiana border. The cultural context and interaction of the area is poorly
understood, and the ceramic sequence at the Texas/Louisiana margin should help in
developing an understanding of cultural interactions in the region. Regional work suggests
that there appears to be an early link between coastal southeast Texas and Louisiana groups,
as reflected in a transition from Tchefuncte/Mandeville ceramics of the Tchula Period, to a
relatively locally inspired sandy paste Goose Creek ware, followed by grog tempered Coles
Creek/Plaquemine tradition wares. Site 41OR89 appears to have the potential to yield data
necessary to begin addressing many of these basic questions.
Site 41OR89 has been found eligible for inclusion on the NRHP. As the site is
located near activities associated with the Golden Pass Pipeline Project, appropriate measures
will be put in place in order to protect the site.

CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTION

This report presents the results of eligibility testing for Site 41OR89 conducted by
HRA Gray & Pape, LLC, (HRA Gray & Pape) of Houston, Texas on behalf of AMEC
Paragon, Inc. of Houston, Texas, under contract with Golden Pass Pipeline LP (GPPL)
for the Golden Pass Pipeline Project. GPPL filed an application for a Certificate of
Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) with the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act (NGA), seeking
authorization to construct and operate a natural gas pipeline system and associated
facilities. Site 41OR89 was discovered during the intensive pedestrian survey of a
formerly proposed Golden Pass right-of-way (ROW) alignment. That formerly proposed
pipeline ROW bisected site 41OR89, which covers approximately 0.85 hectares (2.10
acres). Current project plans place the proposed pipeline ROW to the southeast of the
site. The site is located on the Beaumont East 7.5-minute quadrangle map (Figure 1).
Shovel testing, auger testing, and unit excavation during the intensive pedestrian survey
and subsequent eligibility-testing phase resulted in the recovery of 344 prehistoric
artifacts (330 pottery sherds, 6 pieces of debitage, 1 diagnostic arrow point, charcoal and
silicified wood) as well as an intact thermal feature. Artifacts date from the Clear Lake
(100-425 A.D.) to the Round Lake (1000-1350 A.D.) cultural phases. Also recovered
were a small number of historic artifacts that are not related to the site and therefore not
included in this report. Investigations revealed that the site deposit is intact, although
there is no evidence for deeply buried strata. Based on these findings, HRA Gray & Pape
recommends Site 41OR89 eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP) based on Criterion D.

ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT
This report is organized into six numbered chapters and three lettered appendices.
Chapter I provides an overview of the project and summarizes the results of the
archaeological investigation. Chapter II presents an overview of the environmental
setting and geomorphology of the project area. Chapter III presents a discussion of the
cultural context associated with the project area. Chapter IV presents the research design
and field methods developed for this survey, and includes a discussion of techniques used
for laboratory processing and the curation of artifacts recovered during the investigation.
A discussion of previous investigations specific to resources encountered during the
survey, and the results of current research and survey activities, are presented in Chapter
V. Chapter VI presents the investigation summary, and provides recommendations for
Site 41OR89. Appendix A presents an inventory of artifacts recovered from Site
41OR89. Appendix B contains Vitae of key project personnel. Site revisit forms are
located in Appendix C. Appendix D contains correspondence outlining avoidance
measures to take place during nearby project construction.

CHAPTER II. ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING AND SOILS

As part of the Western Gulf Coastal Plain, the environmental setting of the region
is a combination of flat coastal zones and slightly rolling inlands set between eastern
woodlands and western prairies (Finneman 1938). The entire area is associated with
creeks, agricultural fields, marshlands, and urban or otherwise developed properties. The
flat topography of the coast is broken by dunes, ridges and incised stream channels while
upland terraces are at times dotted with natural sand mounds. The climate is mild with
hot summers and warm winters with the occasional cold front bringing temperatures to
around freezing. The region includes many vegetation zones. Those near the coast
contain marsh, shortgrasses, and water-tolerant trees, while those further inland may
include oak savannas, prairies, mixed hardwoods, and dense pines (Jones 1983).

SURFACE GEOLOGY
Site 41OR89 is located in the Gulf Coastal Plain of Texas. The Geologic Atlas of
Texas, Beaumont and Houston sheets, shows the sediments underlying the area to be of
Pleistocene age or younger. These sediments are composed primarily of sand and clay,
with minor amounts of conglomerate (University of Texas Bureau of Economic Geology
[UT-BEG] 1992a, 1992b). The site is within the Neches River floodplain. The Neches
River drainage is composed of Quaternary Alluvium deposits. The Deweyville
Formation of Late Pleistocene or Holocene age outcrops along most of the Quaternary
Alluvium (UT-BEG 1992b).
Quaternary Alluvium is composed of clay, silt, sand and local organic matter. The
Deweyville Formation is composed of silt, sand, clay and gravels. Regionally, the
Beaumont Formation is dominated by clay and sand. All of the sediments are deposits of
fluvial systems or coastal plains ascribed to depositional conditions influenced by the
combined action of sea level changes from glacial advance in the northern portions of the
continent, and subsequent downcutting and variations in the sediment load capacity of the
region’s rivers (Van Siclen 1991; Kane 1963; Fisher et al. 1973). As the sea level began
to rise with the retreat of the Late Wisconsin ice sheet, shoreline progradation and
alluviation resulted in valley filling of the Sabine River, closing the southern portion of
the valley and forming Sabine Lake.

GEOMORPHOLOGY OF SITE 41OR89
Geomorphologically, Site 41OR89, appears to be situated on what was originally
a point bar along a now abandoned channel of the Neches River, or part of an older
coastal chenier, that was later dissected by at least two Holocene episodes of stream
4

migration. The Neches River apparently shifted its course to the south forming a Ushaped “island” between the new channel and the oxbow of the old channel (Figure 1).
Similar islands are visible along the Neches River between Beaumont and Port Arthur on
recent maps and aerial photographs of the region. An undulating topography similar to
that observed elsewhere in deltaic and coastal systems along the Gulf Coast Marsh (cf.
Abbott 2001; McGuff and Roberson 1974; Midkiff and Roy 1995) appears to have
developed on this island. At the time this site and nearby site 41OR85, which is a
National Register-eligible site located to the northeast of Site 41OR89, were inhabited,
the main channel of the Neches River likely passed immediately south of both sites. Both
sites would have been ideally located at what would have been one of the topographically
highest and driest locations suitable for exploiting riparian, coastal and upland resources
in the surrounding region. In addition, the main channel location would have made the
sites accessible by watercraft for waterborne interaction with more distant groups.
The “island” on which the sites were originally located appears to have been
dissected locally by a number of smaller streams that developed after the sites were
abandoned and the Neches River shifted to its present course. An abandoned channel of
one such stream now forms the eastern boundary of the site. Shovel testing in portions of
this paleochannel revealed soil profiles similar to the sandy and loamy substrata observed
in deeper levels of units excavated at the site. Examination of the local landform
indicates the paleochannel may be relatively young and that it formed in the sand ridge
by a former low order tributary of the Anderson Gully. The paleochannel, and a
paleochannel to the northeast, are in line with two forks of a second order stream visible
on recent maps and aerial photographs approximately 0.75 kilometers (0.47 miles)
southeast of the site. The stream currently flows through a culvert into the Anderson
Gully near its confluence with the modern channel of the Neches River.

SOILS
Site 41OR89 is located above the Neches River in Orange County, Texas.
Although published soils data are not currently available, the soils in Orange County are
discussed in broad terms based on information available in the Natural Resource
Conservation Service (NRCS) State Soil Geographic Database (NRCS 1998), and the
Official Soil Series Descriptions available on-line from the NRCS Soil Survey Division
(NRCS 1998, Soil Survey Staff, Natural Resources Conservation Service, United States
Department of Agriculture [SSS NRCS USDA] 2007). In general, marsh environments
typical to the southern sections of Orange County contain dark loamy clays or clays, with
increased sand content on ridges or knolls. Upland areas, similar to the setting for Site
41OR89, tend to contain sandy loams.

FLORA AND FAUNA
The project area is located in the Austroriparian biotic province as described by
Blair (1950), which consists of plants that are mostly adapted to ample or excess moisture

(e.g. mesic forests of pine and hardwoods) (United States Army Corps of Engineers, Fort
Forth District [USACE-FW] 1999). Faunal species typical to the southeast coastal plain
are mice, rats, treefrogs, frogs, numerous species of snakes, land turtles, salamanders and
a variety of waterfowl shorebirds and rangeland/forest birds (Blair 1950; USACE-FW
1999).
The project area is also situated within the Coastal Prairies division of the Gulf
Prairies and Marshes vegetation as delineated by Gould (1974). The Coastal Prairie is a
nearly level, slowly drained plain covered mainly with agricultural crops and intermixed
with a dominant bluestem grassland community and pecan-elm forest in the bottomlands
and along streams that dissect the plain and empty into the Gulf of Mexico (USACE-FW
1999).

CHAPTER III. CULTURE HISTORY

During the prehistoric period, present-day Orange County, with its dense
woodlands, numerous marshes and abundant streams, creeks and tributaries was an
attractive environment for human occupation. Orange County lies within the larger Gulf
of Mexico coastal zone, a region that has been extensively studied by archaeologists.
While much is known of the cultural and demographic dynamics of the coastal zone, the
prehistory of the sub-region surrounding 41OR89 remains poorly understood (Ricklis
1994). Basic questions regarding occupation and cultural interaction at the present-day
Texas/Louisiana border have yet to be answered by researchers interested in
understanding cultural interaction and regional contact. Investigations at 41OR89 may
result in evidence in the archaeological record of variation in this cultural interaction as
represented by ceramic use, technology, and, if present, evidence of pottery manufacture.
Prehistoric archaeological sites identified in the inland regions of the Gulf Coastal
Plain tend to be composed of ephemeral, shallow deposits reflecting short-term
occupation episodes. Inland sites are less likely to consist of middens and are more
similar to generalized open campsites consisting of temporally non-diagnostic lithic
scatters with thin subsurface deposits. Sites of this type have little to no stratification due
to a short occupation time, erosion, and land clearing. Thus, subsurface features are rare
(USACE-FW 1999). Prehistoric cultural resources located near the coast between the
Brazos River and Sabine Lake consist of shell middens found in estuaries or exposed in
cutbanks along streams (Aten 1983; Patterson 1995). These middens usually contain
faunal material as well as cultural remains such as lithic tools and pottery. In both inland
and coastal subregions, sites are most often found near stream channels.
It has been postulated that settlement patterns in the region are reflected in the
seasonality of food species, namely rangia clam. Aten (1983) has used oyster seasonality
studies to suggest larger winter encampments inland and summer dispersal into small
bands on the coast. In contrast, other seasonal studies and historic accounts describe the
habitation of the barrier islands in the winter and movement inland during the spring
(Ricklis 1994). Studies suggest an increase in coastal habitations in the Late Ceramic
Period, perhaps due in part to population pressures inland (Ricklis 2004). Further, these
coastal habitations appear to display a trend toward an increase in population density over
time (Patterson 1987, 1995). As area populations grew they periodically split to form
smaller groups, culminating in several macrobands, as displayed by the Akokisa in Early
Historic times (Aten 1983). During the Early Ceramic Period these groups were
organized within an egalitarian social order (Aten 1983) but had become stratified by the
Late Prehistoric, an inference based on the results from comparative studies of wealth
variability in mortuary traditions (Ricklis 1994).

Based on aspects of material culture researchers have identified six archaeological
time periods associated with Native Americans in southeast Texas; in general, these
include the Paleoindian, Archaic (with Early, Middle, and Late subdivisions), Ceramic,
Late Prehistoric, Protohistoric, and Historic Indian. Some researchers further delineate
these periods, such as Patterson’s (1995) chronology consisting of: Early Paleoindian
(10,000-8000 B.C.); Late Paleoindian (8000-5000 B.C.); Early Archaic (5000-3000
B.C.); Middle Archaic (3000-1500 B.C.); Late Archaic (1500 B.C.- 100 A.D.); Early
Ceramic (100 A.D. - 600 A.D.); Late Prehistoric (600 A.D. – 1500 A.D.); Protohistoric
(1500 A.D. – 1700 A.D.); and the Historic Indian (1700 A.D. – 1800 A.D.) periods. The
chronologies developed by researchers are based primarily on changes in projectile point
technologies within the region and the introduction of pottery. It is generally recognized
that a broad-based hunting and gathering lifestyle was utilized throughout all time
periods.

THE CERAMIC PERIOD AND THE LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD IN THE UPPER
TEXAS COAST
Cultural remains at Site 41OR89 appear to represent the Ceramic Period of the
Upper Texas Coast (UTC). Ceramic technology first appeared on the coast around two
thousand years ago and disseminated inland later (Aten 1983, 1984; Shafer 1975; Story
1990). The ceramic tradition in Southeast Texas is thought to have developed from
eastern Woodland cultures and thus reflects the ceramic types found there (Aten 1984;
Shafer 1975). Aten (1983: 297) suggests that early ceramics of the UTC show traits that
developed from or share a common origin with those of the Lower Mississippi Valley
(LMV). This is more so the case along the coast, while inland ceramics show stylistic
influences emblematic of cultural groups to the north (Aten 1983; Story 1990). This
model stresses the view that Southeast Texas prehistory is a mixture of locally innovated
and diffused technologies. In contrast to this, some researchers consider ceramic types
found in the region of Southeast Texas as fairly homogenous and distinct (Story 1990).
In either case, it is generally agreed that the earliest ceramic forms in the region appear
along the coast at the Texas and Louisiana border. These are associated with the
Tchefuncte culture; a culture that encompassed the Louisiana Gulf Coast and LMV (Ford
and Quimby 1945; Griffin 1986; Jeter et al. 1989). Provided below is a discussion of
archaeological time periods as they are defined for the UTC.
With the introduction of ceramics, the Archaic period in southeast Texas ends and
the Ceramic period begins. Patterson (1995) places the beginning of the Early Ceramic
period on the Texas coast from 100- 600 A.D. Aten (1983) has placed the appearance of
pottery in the Galveston Bay area at ca. 100 A.D. This may have come as a result of
increased population and decrease of mobility, making pottery more useful to those
adopting a more sedentary lifestyle (Patterson 1995). The ceramic chronology of the
inland subregion parallels that of the coast; only it does not begin until several centuries
later and lacks the earliest and some later ceramic types present in the coastal subregion
(Aten 1983; Story 1990). The same cultural lag exists from east to west along the Texas
coast (Aten 1983).

Projectile points during this sub-period include the Gary and socketed bone
points. Similarly, arrow points, drills, and finally glass beads and other European goods
gradually become more common over time (Aten 1983).
The Late Prehistoric period lasted from 700 to 1700 A.D. (Aten 1983). No major
shifts in lifestyle during this period from the Ceramic period are evident (Ricklis 2004)
although there were major technological changes, such as sandy paste ceramics and,
around 700 A.D., the bow and arrow (Story 1990; Ricklis 2004). Characteristic projectile
points are straight and expanded stem types that include the Delhi, Ellis, Epps, Gary,
Kent, Alba, Catahoula, Cliffton, Fresno, Friley, Hayes, Perdiz, Scallorn, and Steiner
points (Story 1990; Turner and Hester 1993; Ricklis 2004).
Ethnic affiliations for the region are not entirely clear. During the Late
Prehistoric, peoples known today as the Karankawas, Atakapans, and Bidai, to name a
few, are identifiable both culturally and materially. These cultural groups are known to
us primarily through historic accounts from the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. Aten (1983)
has defined the Brazos Delta-West Bay, Galveston Bay, and Sabine Lake archaeological
areas and suggests that they may correlate with the Historic territories of the Coco,
Akokisa, and Atakapa groups respectively. Similarly, historic reconstructions of the
inland subregion suggest a number of possible group affiliations (Story 1990). In part,
this is the result of the dynamic nature of this region in which a number of cultural
traditions met and diffused.
The region encompassing Site 41OR89 was dominated by the Atakapans, a
loosely organized group of hunters and gatherers. Their language group extended from
the Gulf coast to the Trinity and San Jacinto Rivers and they had much in common with
the coastal group known as the Karankawas (Aten 1984). The Atakapans were
subdivided into regional groups. The Akokisas dwelled primarily on the shores of the
Trinity and San Jacinto Rivers. The Patiris group occupied the land north of the San
Jacinto valley. The Bidai group dominated the Trinity Valley and to their north was the
small group known as the Deadoes. Much of what is known about the Atakapan culture
comes from the early accounts of the French explorer DeBellise. They are described as
primarily hunter-gather groups who relied somewhat on agriculture and fishing (Sjoberg
1951). The Sabine Lake area is described as home to various Atakapan speaking groups
with historical ties to present-day coastal Louisiana. The area is poorly understood at
present, and insufficient data exist that are necessary to formulate a model by which to
recognize distinct cultural groups. While specific models for these groups’ lifeways have
yet to be formulated, they are widely believed to have been culturally distinct, yet interact
with, peoples of other cultural traditions.

CERAMIC PERIODS OF THE UPPER TEXAS AND LOUISIANA COAST
Aten (1983) has divided the coastal subregion of Southeast Texas into
chronological ceramic periods. These periods are based on either change in pottery and
9

non-ceramic artifact types or in their proportions within the archaeological record.
Periods include Clear Lake (100 – 425 A.D.); Mayes Island (425 – 650 A.D.); Turtle Bay
(650 – 1000 A.D.); Round Lake (1000 – 1350 A.D.); Old River (1350 – 1700 A.D.);
Orcoquisac (1700 – 1800 A.D.); and an Unnamed late Historic Period (1800+ A.D.). The
predominant ceramic type throughout Southeast Texas was Goose Creek sandy paste
(Patterson 1995). This type appears in Aten’s coastal chronology to greater or lesser
extents in nearly every period, particularly Mayes Island, Turtle Bay, Round Lake, and
the later Orcoquisac periods. Because of the predominance of sandy paste pottery across
the region, Story (1990) has suggested the Mossy Grove tradition as an encompassing
cultural tradition for the area. Other ceramic forms that occur in the region include grogtempered, stamped, and bone-tempered pottery (Patterson 1995). Provided below is a
discussion of the ceramic time periods as they are defined by Aten (1983) for the
Galveston area. Although these time periods may have correlates to the surrounding
region it should be noted that cultural patterns in the inland region of Southeast Texas are
presently not well documented (Ricklis 1994, 2004).

The Tchefuncte Ceramic Period
The Tchefuncte Culture (500 B.C. – 300 A.D.), as defined by Smith et al. (1983),
is characterized by the first widespread use of ceramics in the LMV. The origin of the
ceramics is unknown, but it has been suggested that the Lake Pontchartrain, Louisiana,
area is one possibility; another being the Georgia-Florida coast (Smith et al. 1983).
Tchefuncte vessels can be either plain or decorated, tempered with sand or clay, and can
be decorated with incisions, punctuations, rocker stamping, and cord and fabric
impressions (Smith et al. 1983). It is postulated that these early ceramics from the LMV
were introduced to the UTC and from there disseminated into regions inland and to the
west (Ellis and Ensor 1998).

The Clear Lake Ceramic Period
The Clear Lake Ceramic Period (100 – 425 A.D.), as defined by Aten (1983)
represents the first appearance of ceramics on the UTC. This period falls within the
general time frame of the Early Ceramic Period of Southeast Texas (Aten 1983; Patterson
1995). Ceramic types within the period consist of Tchefuncte Plain and Stamped,
Mandeville Plain, O’Neal Plain, and Goose Creek Plain. Aten (1983) has postulated that
the Tchefuncte and Mandeville ceramics are the earliest to be introduced in the area, most
likely due to links with the LMV, and Goose Creek ceramics developing near the end of
the period. Tchefuncte and Mandeville ceramics are described as being thick-walled jars
or deep bowls, some with flat bases, and consist of contorted to sandy paste (Ellis and
Ensor 1998). Goose Creek wares are generally composed of thin walls with a
homogenous sandy paste (Aten 1983; Ellis and Ensor 1998). Gary dart points and
socketed bone points are diagnostic tool types within the period.

The Mayes Island Ceramic Period
The Mayes Island Ceramic Period (425 to 650 A.D.), falls within the Early
Ceramic Period of Southeast Texas (Aten 1983; Patterson 1995). Within this period
various varieties of Goose Creek ceramics are the dominate types, with Goose Creek
Plain being the most common. Also included are small amounts of Goose Creek Incised
and Goose Creek Red Filmed. Gary dart points and socketed bone points continue to be
diagnostic tool types within the period.

The Turtle Bay Ceramic Period
The Turtle Bay Ceramic Period, dating from 650 – 1000 A.D., falls within the
early part of the Late Prehistoric Period of Southeast Texas (Aten 1983; Patterson 1995).
Goose Creek Plain ceramics are maintained as the predominant type, with increasing
amounts of Incised and Red Filmed wares (Aten 1983). A change in tool technology,
specifically the introduction of the bow and arrow in 700 A.D., and associated arrow
points, is a demarcating feature between this and previous ceramic periods. The most
common arrow points are the Alba, Catahoula, and Scallorn types (Turner and Hester
1993).

The Round Lake Ceramic Period
The Round Lake Ceramic Period dates from 1000 – 1350 A.D. and falls within
the middle to later stages of the Late Prehistoric Period of Southeast Texas (Aten 1983;
Patterson 1995). The predominance of Goose Creek ceramics declines within this period
and grog-tempered types become more prevalent (Aten 1983). Like the earlier
Tchefuncte and Mandeville pottery types, grog-tempered pottery is believed to have been
introduced from the east (Ricklis 2004). Decorations become more complex during this
period and generally reflect motifs from coastal Louisiana and the LMV, suggesting more
interaction with eastern areas (Ricklis 2004). Tool assemblages during this time become
more diversified and include lithic drills, blades, and scrapers (Aten 1983).

The Old River Ceramic Period
The Old River Ceramic Period (1350 – 1700 A.D.) takes place during a
transitional time between the Late Prehistoric to the Protohistoric Period of Southeast
Texas (Aten 1983; Patterson 1995). The defining change from the Round Lake to the
Old River Period is the decrease in grog-tempered ceramics and the resurgence of Goose
Creek type wares (Aten 1983). Also making an appearance are small amounts of bonetempered ceramics. Perdiz arrow points become more common during this period as do
lithic blades and other tools.

The Orcoquisac Ceramic Period
The Orcoquisac Ceramic Period is dated to 1700 – 1800 A.D. and falls with the
Historic Indian Period of Southeast Texas (Aten 1983; Patterson 1995). This ceramic
period is defined by the dominance of Goose Creek type ceramics and the lack of grogtempered pottery. The more recent dates also account for the appearance of Europeanmade goods such as glass beads.

CHAPTER IV. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

The research design and methods used to initially identify Site 41OR89 were
standard for intensive pedestrian survey in the State of Texas. Detailed information on
those procedures are presented in the Cultural Resource Management Survey of the
Proposed Golden Pass LNG Pipeline Route in Jefferson, Orange, and Newton Counties,
Texas, FERC Docket No. PF04-1-000 [Revised Draft] (Hughey and Picklesimer 2004) on
file with the Texas Historical Commission (THC). The survey methods and results of the
intensive pedestrian survey of 41OR89 are summarized below.

PREVIOUS WORK AT SITE 41OR89
Site 41OR89 was originally identified during the first field visit (September 2004)
by HRA Gray and Pape, which consisted of an intensive pedestrian survey for the Golden
Pass Pipeline ROW. During this field effort, 2 staggered shovel test transects (A and B)
were undertaken within the proposed ROW, resulting in 4 shovel tests that yielded
prehistoric material. Delineation shovel tests were excavated to establish the horizontal
extents of the site and resulted in a further 11 positive shovel tests.
Shovel tests typically measured 30 centimeters (11.81 inches) in diameter and
were excavated in 10 centimeter (3.94 inch) levels to a maximum depth of 1 meter (3.28
feet) into the underlying substratum or until culturally sterile subsoil was encountered.
Removed soils were screened through ¼-inch hardware cloth. Descriptions of soil texture
and color followed standard terminology and the Munsell (2000) soil color charts.
Additional information concerning soils encountered was recorded on standardized
shovel test forms for each shovel test excavation.
A second visit (October 2004) to the site was made in order to investigate the
stratigraphic integrity of the site deposit and determine if deeply buried deposits might be
present. During this visit, three 1 by 1 meter (3 foot by 3 foot) test units (Test Units 1
through 3) were excavated. Additional prehistoric artifacts were recovered, and Feature
1, a thermal feature was identified in Test Unit 2. Since feature excavation was outside
the scope of the investigation at the time, the feature was described and photographed in
plan view. The test unit was then mapped in plan, and a profile of the unit sidewall
illustrating the relation of the feature to soil stratigraphy was drawn. The feature was
then covered with plastic, and the unit was terminated and backfilled in order to protect
the feature and avoid disturbance of deeper portions of the feature.
During the site definition process each test unit was excavated by natural soil
layers employing 20-centimeter (8-inch) arbitrary levels, measured from the highest
corner of the unit (the unit datum). The test units were excavated with flat shovel and
13

trowel to depths ranging between 45 and 120 centimeters (19 to 48 inches). Soils
recovered during the excavation of test units were passed through ¼ - inch hardware
mesh, except clay which was hand sorted.
Once a depth of 120 centimeters (4 feet) was reached, a posthole auger test was
excavated in the center of the unit to a depth of at least 2 meters (6.5 feet) below surface.
Posthole auger tests were a safe way to determine the presence of any deeply buried
cultural deposits. Each posthole test was also excavated at 20-centimeter (7.87 inches)
arbitrary levels, measured from the unit datum. Test Unit 2 was terminated at a depth of
45 centimeters (19 inches) when a possible cultural feature (Feature 1) was detected.
This feature was not excavated; instead, it was protected in place pending the need for
National Register evaluation testing. Test Units 1 and 3 were excavated to depths of 120
centimeters (48 inches). In addition, a 13-centimeter (5-inch) posthole auger was
excavated in the center of the base of each of these two test units to depths ranging from
120 centimeter (48 inches) to over 2 meters (6.6 feet) depth to test for the potential for
deeply buried cultural resources. No artifacts or evidence for deeply buried features were
found in either posthole auger, or below 60 centimeters (23.62 inches) below ground
surface.
The artifacts recovered during these investigations consisted of 342 total items.
The prehistoric assemblage is comprised of 327 prehistoric ceramic sherds, 1 arrow point
(Alba), and 5 fragments of lithic debitage. The historic assemblage consists of 1 handwrought nail and 2 indeterminate nails. Seven miscellaneous/organic materials recovered
at the site include 2 charcoal fragments, and 1 Melia azedarach seed. The prehistoric
ceramics consisted of 259 sand tempered Goose Creek Plain sherds (Aten 1983:231-233),
4 Goose Creek Red-Filmed sherds, 32 grog tempered Baytown Plain sherds, 5 possible
Tchefuncte Plain sherds (Aten 1983:238) but with sand noted in the paste, 14 untyped
plain sand tempered sherds, 2 untyped incised sand tempered sherds, 1 untyped burnished
sand tempered sherd, 1 untyped incised grog tempered sherd, 6 untyped sherds of
unknown temper. The assemblage also included 1 punctated untyped sherd with a sand
temper and 2 thick walled untyped sherds with either sand temper or a sandy paste,
similar to Mandeville Plain but generally lacking a contorted paste.
Results of intensive pedestrian survey suggested that Site 41OR89 contained
intact cultural remains and thus had the potential for being eligible for nomination to the
NRHP under Criterion D. Further, potential impacts to the site from proposed pipeline
construction prompted further testing aimed at determining its NR eligibility. This took
place in two mobilizations, the methods and results for which are addressed below.

ELIGIBILITY TESTING METHODOLOGY
Eligibility testing of Site 41OR89 consisted of a combination of shovel test
excavation, posthole excavation, and unit excavation. To ensure a consistent level of
investigation throughout the project area, standardized forms were used to record each
class of information. Project maps were maintained illustrating field conditions, survey
14
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION—DO NOT RELEASE

techniques used, and the location of cultural resources identified. Photographs were
taken of general field conditions.
Shovel Test Excavation
Shovel Tests were excavated in order to refine the site boundaries and examine
off-slope areas for potential deposits. Shovel tests typically measured 30 centimeters
(11.81 inches) in diameter and were excavated to a maximum depth of 1 meter (3.28 feet)
into the underlying substratum or until culturally sterile subsoil was encountered.
Removed soils were screened through ¼-inch hardware cloth. Descriptions of soil
texture and color followed standard terminology and the Munsell (2000) soil color charts.
Additional information concerning soils encountered was recorded on standardized
shovel test forms for each shovel test excavation.
Posthole Excavation
Posthole tests were excavated for 2 reasons, 1) to determine the water table level
within the site, and 2) to sample the surrounding marsh to test for subsidence. In both
instances soils were excavated in the same manner as shovel tests, albeit with less vertical
control.
Test Unit Excavation
Test units were excavated to search for intact cultural features. Factors used to
determine test unit locations included the results of previously excavated shovel tests and
units, particularly the depth, quantity, and types of artifacts recovered. Landform
analysis at the site, and the relation of positive tests to the project footprint also played a
role in selecting test unit locations.
During eligibility testing each test unit was excavated by natural soil layers employing
10-centimeter (3.94-inch) arbitrary levels, measured from the highest corner of the unit
(the unit datum). Soils recovered during the excavation of test units were passed through
¼ - inch hardware mesh, except clay, which was hand sorted.
Artifacts, ecofacts, and charcoal fragments possibly suitable for radiocarbon
dating detected in situ in a test unit, were mapped and sometimes photographed before
being collected. Artifacts were collected and bagged by level, but otherwise artifact
collection procedures were the same as those used during shovel testing.
Upon completion of a unit at least one wall of the unit representative of soil
stratigraphy observed in the unit, was photographed and a profile was drawn of it. In
addition, the composition of the soils encountered was also recorded on standard unit
level forms, and any artifacts recovered were collected and bagged by unit level.

LABORATORY ANALYSIS
Laboratory analysis provided the foundation for evaluating site chronology and
function. Initial processing of recovered artifacts included washing and sorting according
to raw material category and provenience. Provenience was maintained throughout the
process by the use of a computerized field specimen log, which in turn generated an
inventory of materials recovered.
Cataloging the assemblage involved recording data on each artifact including
form, material, functional classification, manufacturing technology, and attributes that are
chronologically diagnostic. Material classifications are subdivided to afford greater
flexibility and detail of inclusive data. The attributes category in the inventory provides
additional information on individual size, condition, or completeness.
In general, analyses of prehistoric cultural materials was conducted with the
following objectives: (1) identification of artifacts recognized as diagnostic of specific
cultures or time periods; (2) identification of reduction sequences represented by the
lithic debitage; (3) identification of utilized and/or retouched debitage; (4) identification
of raw materials represented among the tools and debitage; and (5) identification of
recovered ceramic types. A discussion of prehistoric artifact analysis methods is provided
below.
Very little historic cultural material was encountered during the project.
Therefore, a discussion of laboratory methods associated with historic material culture is
not provided.

PREHISTORIC CERAMIC ANALYSIS
For the purposes of the ceramic analysis, sherds that could be glued together were
counted as 1 sherd. Any sherds less than 4 square centimeters in size were excluded from
detailed descriptive analysis although temper and surface treatment were recorded for
these specimens along with Munsell color if warranted. All rims and decorated sherds
were described in detail and analyzed. The ceramic analysis included examination of
each sherd under a 10x lens bent-arm magnifying glass to identify attributes of paste and
temper. The percentage of the primary temper and secondary and tertiary inclusions were
determined with the primary temper generally being greater than 50 percent. Sherd
thickness (body, neck, shoulder, basal, and lip) was measured in millimeters using
calipers for all rims and sheds larger than 4 centimeters square (1.5 inches square). As
previously stated sherd color designations were made using a Munsell color chart.
Assessments were made as to the degree of firing displayed by the compactness or
friability of each sherd. The sherds were further sorted into ware groups that were similar
with respect to attributes of paste and temper type. Within each ware group, there were
several different categories that were differentiated from one another based upon
attributes of surface treatment.

PREHISTORIC LITHIC ANALYSIS
In order to analyze the lithic assemblage, a group of variables was formulated
comprising a series of attributes that describes specific aspects of the flaking
terminology. These variables were developed in a hierarchical fashion with an initial
sorting of artifacts into major classes (e.g., retouched pieces and debitage). The tools
were further subdivided into subclasses, including bifaces/preforms, projectile points,
scrapers, and miscellaneous tools. The debitage was divided into unretouched and
retouched flakes. The categories used to describe biface reduction follow in a broad
sense those proposed by Newcomer (1971), Callahan (1979), and Bradley and Sampson
(1986). It should be noted, however, that rigid schemes of reduction such as those cited,
which break up into stages a process that is in fact an unbroken continuum from raw
material selection to the final abandonment of the tool, can only approximate the course
of a manufacturing trajectory used by prehistoric knappers. Prehistoric artifacts are
sorted by artifact type, for example projectile point, based on standard references such as
Turner and Hester (1993) and Justice (1987). Specific descriptive terminology was based
on Cambron and Hulse (1964) and Justice (1987).
Debitage categories are based upon classification schemes currently used by both
Old and New World prehistorians (Bordes 1961; Frison 1974; Tixier et al. 1980). The
first level of analysis involves separating flakes, cores, and fragments (shatter and
“chunks” of raw material) and listing the presence or absence of features such as cortex.
The flakes then are subdivided, as much as is possible, into groups that would more
specifically identify the reduction sequence to which they belong. When subdivided and
possible, raw material type is recorded. The following terminology has been applied to
the classification of prehistoric artifacts. Raw material identification was accomplished
using visible properties such as cleavage, texture, color, luster, and fracture (see Luedtke
1992:63-77). Heat-treated materials were distinguished from fresh materials using
visible properties as well.
Debitage Terms
Angular Shatter: Shatter can either be produced during the knapping process or through
natural agents. Naturally occurring shatter is usually the result of a thermal action
shattering a block of chert. During debitage, shatter can result from an attempt to flake a
piece of chert with internal flaws and fracture lines. For the purposes of the current
undertaking, shatter is defined as a piece of chert that shows no evidence of having been
struck by humans, but nonetheless may be a waste product from a knapping episode.
Generally, shatter is angular or blocky in form.
Blank: When a flake is detached from a block of raw material it may be regarded as
waste, utilized without modification, or used as a “blank” to be retouched into a tool (e.g.
a scraper or denticulate).
Broken Flake Fragments or Flake Shatter: Quite often, the force of the hammer during
debitage results in the breaking of the flake in one or more pieces. The result is proximal,
medial, or distal fragments of debitage that are not angular, and often show previous flake
removal scars on their dorsal surface. These characteristics distinguish flake shatter from
18
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION—DO NOT RELEASE

angular shatter. Flake shatter is a common occurrence in percussion debitage but can
occur at any time in the knapping process.
Chip: This term, introduced by Newcomer and Karlin (1987), describes tiny flakes (<1
cm in length) that are detached during several different types of manufacturing
trajectories. First, they can result from the preparation of a core or biface edge by
abrasion, a procedure that strengthens the platform prior to the blow of the hammer.
During biface manufacture, chips are detached when the edge is “turned” and a platform
is created in order to remove longer, more invasive flakes. Tiny flakes of this type are
also removed during the manufacture of tools like end-scrapers.
Core: A core is a block of raw material, other than a biface preform, from which flakes
have been detached. Cores may be produced by careful preparation or may consist of a
block of material from which only a few flakes have been detached.
Debitage: The French term debitage has two related meanings: 1) it refers to the act of
intentionally flaking a block of raw material to obtain its products, and 2) it refers to
those products themselves. Commonly, the term debitage is used by prehistorians to
describe flakes, which have not been modified by secondary retouch and made into tools.
Flake: A flake is a product of debitage that has a length/width ratio of 1:1 (de Sonneville
Bordes 1960). In this report there are two separate categories of flakes and the first is for
those pieces to which a specific reduction sequence cannot be assigned. With these
pieces it is impossible to tell whether they have been detached during simple core
reduction or biface manufacture. For example, cortical flakes initially removed from a
block of raw material can appear similar in both core and biface reduction.
Initial Reduction Flakes: These debitage are typically thick, have cortex on the majority
of their dorsal surfaces, and have large plain or simply faceted butts. There are relatively
few dorsal scars. Initial reduction flakes may show removals from the opposite edge of
the biface.
Janus flake: These are a debitage type produced during the initial reduction of a flake
blank (Tixier et al. 1980). The removal of a flake from the ventral surface of a larger
flake results in a flake the dorsal surface of which is completely or partially composed of
the ventral surface of the larger flake blank.
Marginal and non-marginal flaking (c.f. Bradley and Samson 1986): These terms denote
two techniques of delivering the force of the hammer to detach a flake from a core or
biface. Marginal flaking involves the delivery of the blow of the percussor close to the
edge of the piece being flaked. As the blow is close to the edge of the striking platform,
the resulting flake has a small, narrow butt. Non-marginal flaking involves the delivery
of the blow at a point some distance from the edge of the flaked piece. Debitage
detached in this manner often have large, wide butts.
Microdebitage: Is small, > 5 millimeter debitage that is the result of platform abrasion or
retouch (incidental and/or intentional). This debitage class is often not recovered on
archaeological sites due to sampling biases; however, this debitage class can be produced
in great quantities when manufacturing stone tools.
Percussion and pressure flaking: In the case of flint knapping, percussion flaking
involves the use of a hammer or percussor to strike a piece of chert in order to detach a
flake. This hammer can be of a relatively hard material, such as a quartzite hammerstone,
or a softer organic material such as a deer antler. Direct percussion is a flaking
technique, which involves the delivery of the blow directly on to the striking platform,
19
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION—DO NOT RELEASE

while indirect percussion utilizes an intermediary or “punch.” Pressure flaking, as
suggested by the name, involves the chipping of stone by pressure. Flakes are “pressed
off” with the use of a pointed tool such as a deer or elk antler tine.
Platform abrasion: When the blow of the percussor is aimed close to the edge of the
piece being flaked (marginal flaking), it is necessary to prepare and strengthen that edge.
The edge is usually prepared by abrasion, which entails rubbing the striking platform area
with a hammerstone and detaching a series of tiny flakes (chips) from the surface where
the flake will be removed. Evidence of platform abrasion is usually clearly visible on
biface thinning flakes at the intersection between the butt and dorsal surface.
Unspecified Reduction Flake: These flakes cannot be attributed to a specific reduction
sequence and often have unidirectional or opposed dorsal scar patterns and often portions
of cortical surface. It is impossible to discern if this debitage class is the result of core or
bifacial reduction.
The groups of flakes that are a direct result of biface reduction are described as follows:
Biface Initial Reduction Flakes: These debitage are typically thick, have cortex on part of
their dorsal surfaces, and have large plain or simply faceted butts. There are relatively
few dorsal scars, but these may show removal from the opposite edge of the biface.
Biface Thinning Flakes: These debitage result from shaping the biface, while its
thickness is reduced. These flakes generally lack cortex, are relatively thin, and have
narrow, faceted butts, multidirectional dorsal scars, and curved profiles. Thinning flakes
are typically produced by percussion flaking.
Biface Finishing Flakes: These debitage are produced during the preparation of the edge
of the tool. These debitage are similar in some respects to biface thinning flakes, but are
generally smaller and thinner and can be indistinguishable from tiny flakes resulting from
other processes such as platform preparation. Biface finishing flakes may be detached by
either percussion or pressure flaking.
Retouch Tool Terms
Biface: A biface is any retouched tool, partially completed or finished, which has been
flaked by percussion or pressure flaking over both of its surfaces (see bifacial retouch).
Bipolarized or splintered piece: A splintered piece (French piece esquillee) is a roughly
rectangular artifact, usually a broken flake or secondary source pebble, with bifacial
battering on opposing edges. The battering typically takes the form of scalar flake
removals that terminate in hinge fractures; these fractures are the result of percussive,
"bipolar" blows delivered on an anvil.
End-scraper: An end scraper is a tool with a rounded, semi-circular or squared edge
located at the proximal or distal end of a flake that is produced by retouch. A variation of
this type is the so-called hafted scraper, which is made from a broken and rejuvenated
projectile point, which creates a semi-circular edge.
Retouch: This term is taken from the French retouchèè and refers to the modification of a
block of raw material (biface manufacture) or flake by a single removal or series of
removals, thus transforming the piece into a tool. Retouch shapes the original blank and
can take the form of invasive bifacially detached flakes on a projectile point, or small,
20
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION—DO NOT RELEASE

tiny flakes on the edge of an end-scraper. Retouch also may be caused unintentionally
due to utilization; in this case, retouch forms as a result of an activity and not by a
process of intentional modification before use. Utilization retouch is typically
discontinuous along an edge. Retouch can be morphologically quite varied and the
following terms describe the various types and positions of retouch.
The description of retouch morphology on any given tool can, and often does,
involve a combination of the terms discussed below.
Direct retouch: Direct retouch occurs on the dorsal surface of a flake.
Inverse retouch: Inverse retouch occurs on the ventral surface of a flake.
Short retouch: Retouch that is short and produces small debitage such as those produced
when manufacturing tools such as end-scrapers.
Invasive retouch: Invasive retouch is generally elongated and covers a large portion of
the tool. Most often, this type of retouch occurs on bifaces or projectile points and can be
the result of percussion or pressure flaking.
Bifacial Retouch: Bifacial retouch is created when debitage is produced from two
opposing surfaces along the same edge of the tool.
Fine retouch: Fine retouch is characterized by small short flake removals that do not
drastically modify the edge of a flake. Often, fine retouch is the result of utilization.
Semi-abrupt retouch: This retouch type has a semi-abrupt inclination when the angle of
the created edge is roughly 45 degrees (Tixier et al. 1980:89). The angle is measured
from the chipped surface to the dorsal or ventral surface of the flake blank. Semi-abrupt
retouch is often seen on end-scrapers.
Retouched flake or piece: This category of retouched tool is represented by flakes, or
badly broken artifacts, which have limited amounts of retouch and are not standardized
tool forms. The retouch on these artifacts is highly varied in type, inclination, and
position.
Splintered Piece: A splintered piece (piece esquillee) is a rectangular artifact, usually a
broken flake or biface with bifacial battering on opposing edges. The battering is usually
manifest as scalar flake removals, which terminate at hinge fractures and are the result of
percussive blows.
Tool: For the purposes of typological description only, a tool is any flake that has been
shaped and modified by secondary retouch. In the case of biface manufacture, a block of
raw material may be transformed directly by retouch into a tool such as a knife or
projectile point. The term tool, therefore, is used only for descriptive purposes to
separate those artifacts that have been retouched from the debitage or unretouched pieces.
Finally, it should be recognized that the latter group of objects may well have functioned
as tools, for example unretouched flakes with good cutting edges are effective for
skinning and butchery, but this is difficult to determine without a microwear analysis.

CURATION
Artifacts recovered during field investigation are temporarily stored and analyzed at the
Houston office of HRA Gray & Pape. Following the completion of this project, it is
anticipated that all artifacts will be provided to the landowners. If curation in a state
repository is required, artifacts will be prepared for curation according to guidelines
specified by the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines for Archaeology
and Historic Preservation (United States Department of the Interior, National Park
Service [USDI] 1983).

At the completion of fieldwork, the artifacts were appropriately cleaned and
allowed to dry. After identification, each unique artifact or group were placed in 4 mil
plastic resealable bags. Identification tags made from acid-free paper were placed with
the artifacts for future identification. Each tag contains the title of the final report, the
HRA Gray & Pape project number, an individual artifact number, full provenience
information, entire artifact description, processing date, and count.

CHAPTER V. INVESTIGATIONS AT SITE 41OR89

RESULTS OF THE LITERATURE REVIEW
A review of Texas Archeology Research Laboratory (TARL) indicates that 5
previously identified sites are located in the vicinity of Site 41OR89 (Figure 1). Sites
41OR02, 41OR13, and 41OR14 are classified as prehistoric shell middens. Site 41OR85
and 41OR87 are open campsites. Of these, only Site 41OR85 has been determined
eligible for inclusion on the NRHP. Site 41OR85 appears to be closely related to Site
41OR89 based on land form, temporal affiliation and assemblage composition. The two
sites are in close proximity and their affinities are discussed in Chapter VI.

RESULTS OF THE FIELD WORK
Although National Register (NR) eligibility testing was undertaken only as part of
the third site visit to 41OR89, data from a total of four site visits was utilized in making
an eligibility determination for the site. The results for each site visit are discussed below
according to chronological sequence.

First Site Visit (09/2004)
Shovel Test Results
The site was initially identified during intensive pedestrian survey of the Golden
Pass Pipeline. This resulted in the excavation of 22 shovel tests in order to establish the
horizontal extent of the site (Figure 2). Of the 22 shovel tests, 15 shovel tests produced a
total of 94 prehistoric artifacts including pottery sherds (n=95 [3 of which were not
collected]), debitage (n=3), an arrow point (n=1) and organic material – chinaberry seed
(n=1). A summary of the ceramics recovered from shovel tests associated with the site
discovery and delineation is presented in Table 1. Artifact concentrations tended to be on
the high ground, although the area with the highest artifact density lay at the southeast
margin of the site, near the swamp edge.
The debitage consisted of three
shaping/finishing flakes, two made of an unidentified chert and one made of limestone.
The arrow point was identified as an Alba Cluster point (800– 1200 A.D.) made of
silicified wood. The ceramic assembly consists of Goose Creek Plain (n=70), Goose
Creek Red Filmed (n=3), Baytown Plain (n=13), unknown types (n=4), and an unknown
type resembling Mandeville Plain (n=2). The ceramic assemblage recovered during
intensive pedestrian shovel testing is contemporaneous with Aten’s (1983) Clear Lake
Ceramic Period (100 – 425 A.D.) through his Round Lake Ceramic Period (1000 – 1350
A.D.).

Second Site Visit (10/2004)
Test Unit Excavation Results
The second site visit (October 2004) was made in order to investigate the stratigraphic
integrity of the site deposit and determine if deeply buried deposits might be present.
Three 1 by 1 meter (3.3 by 3.3 foot) test units (Test Units 1, 2, and 3) were excavated in
an initial attempt to ascertain the vertical extent of the site. The results of these tests are
discussed below.
Test Unit 1
Test Unit 1 was located on a high spot of the landform in the vicinity of shovel
tests B02 and B02/10N which yielded prehistoric artifacts during the intensive pedestrian
survey shovel testing. Test Unit 1 was excavated by 20-centimeter (7.87-inch) arbitrary
levels within natural stratum to a depth of 120 centimeters (3.94 feet). In addition, a 13­
centimeter (5-inch) posthole auger test was excavated in the center of Test Unit 1 to a
depth of 200 centimeters (78.74 inches). The auger test was employed to safely look for
deeply buried deposits. No artifacts were recovered from the auger test. Artifacts
recovered from Test Unit 1 (n=112) (Table 2) consisted entirely of prehistoric ceramics
including Goose Creek Plain (n=98), Tchefuncte Plain (n=6), and unknown types (n=9).
Artifacts were distributed throughout 80 centimeters (31.50 inches) of soil, with 65
percent of the artifacts coming from between 40 and 60 centimeters (15.75 and 23.62

inches) below ground surface and 90 percent of artifacts coming from between 40 and 80
centimeters (15.74 and 31.50 inches).

Test Unit 2
Test Unit 2 was placed in an area of high artifact concentration at the extreme
south edge of the site, overlooking the marsh (Figure 2). The unit was in the vicinity of
Shovel Test A03/10E/20S. Test Unit 2 was excavated by 20-centimeter (7.87-inch)
arbitrary levels within natural strata. Excavators terminated work in Test Unit 2 at a
depth of 45 centimeters (17.72 inches) when a possible thermal feature (Feature 1) was
detected (Figure 3). This feature was not excavated; instead, it was protected in place
pending the need for NR evaluation testing. Due to recent heavy rains a high water table
prevented the excavation of Feature 1 during the eligibility-testing phase, which remains
preserved in place. Artifacts recovered from Test Unit 2 (n=44) included debitage (n=2)
and prehistoric ceramics (n=42) (Table 3).
Both pieces of debitage were
shaping/finishing flakes. One was made of an unidentified fine medium gray chert, while
the other was made of a heat altered, white chert mottled with gray. The prehistoric
ceramic artifacts included Baytown Plain (n=17), Goose Creek Plain (n=15), and
unknown types (n=10). Ceramic artifacts were distributed throughout 60 centimeters
(23.62 inches) of soil, with 74 percent of the artifacts coming from between 20 and 40
centimeters (7.87 and 15.75 inches) below ground surface.

Test Unit 3
Test Unit 3 was located on high ground in the southeastern portion of the site
(Figure 2). The unit was in the vicinity of Shovel tests A03, A03/10E, and A03/10E/10S,
which yielded a high concentration of artifacts during shovel testing. Test Unit 3 was
excavated by 20-centimeter (7.87-inch) arbitrary levels within natural stratum to a depth
of 120 centimeters (3.94 feet). In addition, a 12.7-centimeter (5-inch) posthole auger was
excavated in the center of Test Unit 3 to a depth of 200 centimeters (78.74 inches). The
auger test was employed to safely look for deeply buried deposits. No artifacts were
recovered from the auger test. Artifacts recovered from Test Unit 3 (n=85) (Table 4)
included prehistoric ceramics (n=80), miscellaneous sandy fragments with iron oxide
(n=3) and wood charcoal (n=2). The prehistoric ceramic artifacts included Goose Creek
Plain (n=76), Baytown Plain (n=2), and an unknown type (n=2). Ceramic artifacts were
distributed throughout 60 centimeters (23.62 inches) of soil, with 50 percent of the
artifacts coming from 20 to 40 centimeters (7.87 to 15.75 inches) below ground surface
and 95 percent of artifacts coming from between 20 and 60 centimeters (7.87and 23.62
inches).

Third Site Visit (02/2007)
The quantity of prehistoric material, the apparent integrity of the site deposit, the
recovery of temporally diagnostic artifacts, and the identification of an intact feature
(Feature 1), prompted a third site visit (February 2007) aimed at making an assessment of
Site 41OR89’s eligibility for nomination to the NRHP under Criterion D. For the
purposes of NR eligibility testing it was decided that the excavation of Feature 1 in Test
Unit 2 would be resumed as well as the excavation of additional test units. In addition to
NR eligibility testing, further delineation of the northern boundary of the site was
undertaken in anticipation of the possibility of the need for site avoidance in the project
planning stages of the Golden Pass Pipeline.
During the third site visit, several factors influenced the outcome of the attempted
NR eligibility testing. Between the first and second site visits in 2004 and third site visit
in 2007, Site 41OR89 was impacted by Hurricane Rita, which made landfall in
September 2005 in the vicinity of the Sabine River. The high winds and storm surge
brought by the hurricane visibly and dramatically altered the landscape of the site (Plates
29
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION—DO NOT RELEASE

1 and 2). Prior to the hurricane, the site was covered in well-developed woodland with
canopy and understory. After the hurricane, many (perhaps 50 percent) large (20 years or
older) trees were toppled and many of those left standing had their tops sheared-off,
resulting in a substantial loss of canopy. The site is now dotted with the large root balls
of trees that were torn out of the ground, nearly all of which fell to the south. Further, the
entire landform may have been flooded during the hurricane, possibly resulting in the
deposition of an unknown amount of overburden.
Also, recent heavy rains saturated the area and significantly raised the water table.
For this reason, posthole testing was undertaken to assist in the determination of whether
or not additional test unit excavation was feasible. Results of all testing during the third
site visit are discussed below.
Shovel Test Results
A total of 12 shovel tests were excavated during the third site visit, 1 of which
was positive for cultural material (Figure 2). Shovel Test B3 20N/0E produced a total of
3 prehistoric artifacts including pottery sherds (n=2), and debitage (n=1) found between
60 and 80 centimeters (23.62 and 31.50 inches) below ground surface. Ceramics
consisted of Goose Creek Red Filmed (n=1), and Baytown Plain (n=1) sherds. Soil
profiles during the third site visit were consistent with previous results with the exception
that a higher water table was witnessed due to recent rains. Shovel tests during the third
mobilization typically reached the water table between 40 to 60 centimeters (15.75 to
23.62 inches).
Test Unit Excavation Results
Two 1 by 1 meter (3.3 by 3.3 foot) test units (Test Units 4 and 5) were dug during
the third site visit in an effort to locate intact features. These units were placed in areas
near previous positive shovel tests. The results of these test units are discussed below.
Test Unit 4
Test Unit 4 was located in the western half of the site on a high spot of the
landform near positive Shovel Test B2 and positive Test Unit 1 (Figure 2). This unit was
excavated to a depth of 40 centimeters (15.75 inches) below datum and one stratum was
observed. Stratum I consisted of a layer of 10YR 3/2 damp clay that became saturated
with depth. At 40 centimeters (15.75 inches) the unit floor became saturated with water
that began seeping in. Due to the clay soil matrix and saturation level, all excavated
material was hand sorted in conjunction with being screened through ¼-inch hardware
cloth in an attempt to locate artifacts. Despite these efforts no cultural materials or
features were found in the unit.

Test Unit 5
Test 5 was located in the south central portion of the site near positive shovel test
A3/10W (Figure 2). This unit was excavated to a depth of 40 centimeters (15.75 inches)
below datum before the water table was reached. One stratum was observed in the unit.
The unit consisted of 10YR 3/2 damp sandy clay that became saturated with depth until
water began seeping in the floor of the unit at 40 centimeters (15.75 inches). Artifacts
recovered from Test Unit 5 (Table 5) included prehistoric ceramics (n=2) discovered
between 10 and 30 centimeters (3.94 and 11.81 inches). No additional artifacts or
features were discovered in the unit.

Posthole Test Results
Unfortunately, the recent heavy rains had saturated the soils and raised the water
table in the area. This severely limited the ability of observing soil profiles. Further,
feature excavation under the existing conditions would have served only to destroy the
deposits without recovering useable data. For this reason two postholes (PH1 and PH2)
were excavated to test for soil saturation on the southeastern portion of the site (Figure 2).
This was done in particular to determine if excavation of additional test units and the
recommencement of the excavation of Feature 1 in Test Unit 2 would be feasible under
the current soil conditions. These tests reached the water table 40 to 50 centimeters
(15.75 to 19.69 inches). It was concluded that cultural remains associated with Feature 1
would potentially be missed or destroyed under the existing field conditions and no
attempts to resume excavation of Test Unit 2 or excavate additional test units were
attempted.

Fourth Site Visit (06/2007)
The fourth and most recent site visit (June 2007) was undertaken to test for
subsidence in the inundated areas of the marsh adjacent to the site to the south. This was
done in anticipation of possible impacts to the area south and southeast of the site due to
pipeline construction.
Posthole Test Results
All subsidence posthole tests were excavated in marsh containing approximately
30 to 40 centimeters (12 to 16 inches) of standing water. A total of 11 posthole tests
were excavated. Five tests were excavated in 2 transects to the south of the site and 6
tests were excavated to the southeast of the site (Figure 2). One test was not excavated
31
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION—DO NOT RELEASE

because of a heavy petroleum slick. Posthole tests were excavated to a depth of between
65 and 100 centimeters (25 to 39 inches) below the surface of the water. No artifacts
were recovered and the soil from all of the posthole tests was generally a very dark gray
(10YR3/1) clay measuring approximately 65 centimeters (25 inches thick) overlaying a
black (10YR2/1) clay with decaying organic material. No evidence of buried cultural
deposits was found.

SITE STRATIGRAPHY
Due to the high saturation of soils in Test Units 4 and 5, the analysis of site
stratigraphy concentrates on the results of fieldwork completed prior to the February
2007 mobilization. This includes Test Units 1 through 3. Soil profiles measured in Test
Units 1, 2, and 3 consisted of a very dark gray (10YR 3/1) to very dark grayish brown
(10YR 3/2) clay loam that was 0 to 20 centimeters (3 to 8 inches) thick (Figure 4). This
stratum was so thin in Test Unit 1 (located near the crest of the sand ridge) that it was not
included in the profile, and thickest in Test Unit 2, located closest to the marsh. This
stratum probably represents an A-horizon derived from mucky clays similar in texture to
the hydric soils now present in the marsh. It is likely that Stratum I represents periods
when water levels were higher in the area, and the marsh transgressed over the sand
ridge. Wetland delineation crews working on this project have placed the wetland
boundary just below (in elevation) and to the south of Test Unit 2, supporting soil data
that indicate the lower elevations of the ridge are likely to be seasonally inundated.
The stratum underlying the A-horizon in the three test units appears to be the
same pedon across the site however, the A-horizon in Test Unit 1, closest to the ridge
crest is underlain by a rooty, 30-40 centimeter (12-20 inch) thick, dark brown (10YR 3/3)
sandy loam mottled with less than 5% yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) fine sand. Oxidized
root channels are common in this stratum, which is a 30-36 centimeter (12-15 inch) thick,
very dark gray (7.5YR 3/2) fine sand with minor amounts of silt and clay in Test Unit 3,
and an over 18 centimeter (7 inch) thick, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) to brown (10YR
4/3) loamy sand in Test Unit 2. This dark, fine sand stratum appears to contain the bulk
of the cultural remains preserved across the site. Along with Stratum I, it is commonly
bioturbated by roots, rodents, and burrowing invertebrates.
Strata underlying Stratum II were observed in Test units 1 and 3, which were
excavated beyond 45 centimeters (18 inches) to auger depths of approximately 2 meters
(6.6 feet). The stratum observed underlying Stratum II in Test Unit 1, was designated
Stratum III (wet and dry). In Test Unit 3, this stratum was subdivided by color and
texture, into strata III, IV, and V. Strata II-IV in the test units are characterized by: (1) a
general reduction in the quantity and thickness of roots with depth; and (2) an increase in
the frequency of fine (less than 5 millimeter [0.2 inch] diameter) reddish to black
manganese nodules with depth. Stratum Va, a wet, brown (10YR 5/4) fine to medium
sand lay under Stratum V in Test Unit 3. Stratum V began at the water table, at a depth
of 183 centimeters (72 inches) and extended to the bottom of the auger hole in Test Unit
3, at a depth of 2.0 meters (6.6 feet).

North Wall Profile of Test Unit 3 at Site 41OR89
Figure 4

HRA Gray & Pape, LLC

The stratigraphic units evident in the test unit profiles appear to be part of a single
arenaceous alluvial packet that becomes increasingly coarser and wetter with depth.
Such a profile suggests a point bar was present at this location. However, there is no
evidence of cross-stratification that would indicate a pointbar in test unit profiles (though
these may have been obscured by subsequent bioturbation). In addition, the soils at
41OR89 differ in composition from the arenaceous soils at 41OR85 as reported by
Brownlow (2001), and appear to share similarities with soils of the HackberryMermentau complex in neighboring Louisiana, and other soils developed in coastal
chenier systems on the Gulf Coast Marsh (cf. Abbott 2001; Brownlow 2001; Midkiff and
Roy 1995; Soil Survey Division [SSD] 2001; SSS NRCS USDA 2007). This may
indicate that the ancient Neches paleochannel in this area cross-cut a coastal chenier
system very quickly, possibly after a major storm. A more detailed interpretation of site
geomorphology should be possible once mapping of Orange County soils is completed,
and additional geomorphological and geological studies of the complex delatic coastal
facies in this area are evaluated.

ARTIFACTS
The artifacts recovered during these investigations consisted of 347 total items.
The prehistoric assemblage is comprised of 330 prehistoric ceramic sherds, 1 arrow point
(Alba), and 6 fragments of lithic debitage, and 7 miscellaneous/organic samples.
(Appendix A; Plates 3 and 4). Incidental to the focus of the eligibility considerations, 1
hand-wrought nail and 2 indeterminate nails were also recovered. Organic materials
recovered at the site include 2 charcoal fragments, and 1 Melia azedarach (Chinaberry)
seed. The prehistoric ceramics consisted of 261 sand tempered Goose Creek Plain sherds
(Aten 1983:231-233), 4 sand tempered Goose Creek Red Filmed sherds, 33 grog
tempered Baytown Plain sherds, 5 sand paste possible Tchefuncte Plain sherds (Aten
1983:238), 18 untyped sand tempered sherds (2 of which are incised), 1 untyped incised
grog tempered sherd, and 6 untyped sherds of unknown temper. The assemblage also
included 2 thick walled untyped sherds with either sand temper or a sandy paste, similar
to Mandeville Plain but generally lacking a contorted paste.
The lithic and ceramic artifacts recovered at the site indicate a long-term cultural
utilization of this area. The presence of Tchefuncte Plain ceramics suggests that the
earliest recognizable occupation occurred during the Clear Lake Period (100–425 A.D.).
Continued occupation of the site is indicated by the presence of Goose Creek Plain
ceramics and an Alba arrow point. The ceramic assemblage is dominated by Goose
Creek wares (Plate 3), suggesting that the site was most intensely occupied during
periods in which Goose Creek pottery was utilized. The Goose Creek Plain type is first
observed during the Clear Lake Period and persists into the Orcoquisac Period (1700 –
1800 A.D.) in various degrees of prevalence (Aten 1983). Baytown Plain ceramics
indicates an occupation from the Round Lake Period (1000 – 1350 A.D.) to the Old River
Period (1350 – 1700 A.D.) as sand tempered ceramic production declined in favor of
grog-tempered ceramics (Aten 1983).

While the ceramic artifacts allow for an extensive temporal association of the site,
the lone diagnostic lithic artifact, the Alba arrow point, offers a more specific time frame.
The Alba arrow point first appeared in the area during the Turtle Bay Period (650 – 1000
A.D.). These time ranges coincide with the Late Prehistoric (800 – 1200 A.D.)
emergence of Alba projectile points (Turner and Hester 1993). In a report prepared by
the US Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District (USACE-FW 1999) it is stated that
arrow points of the Scallorn type were first introduced into the eastern portions of the
Texas Gulf Coast between 500 and 700 A.D. with Alba points being seen as a subsequent
replacement type.
The presence of historic/modern nails in the first stratum is most likely the result
of bioturbation as there was evidence near the shovel tests of ongoing burrowing
activities by armadillos. The area appears to have also been logged at some point in the
past, which could likewise be responsible for some disturbance of the uppermost stratum.
One chinaberry seed (Melia azedarach) was observed in one shovel test. As with the
nails, the most likely explanation for its presence below the surface is that of
bioturbation.
Four of the five test units were positive for cultural material with artifacts
recovered from 5 to 60 centimeters (2 to 24 inches) below ground surface with the
densest concentrations of material recovered between 20 to 60 centimeters (7.8 to 23.6
inches) below ground surface. It is possible that a prehistoric occupation surface is
present at approximately 40-45 centimeters (15-19 inches) below surface as indicated by
a circular burned soil feature (Feature 1) that was detected at this depth in Test Unit 2,
and the highest frequencies of large potsherds encountered at that depth.
The density of artifacts recovered at this site when compared to that at 41OR85
and other similar sites in the region (cf. Brownlow 2001, TARL Site Files) indicates a
substantial occupation. The range and density of artifact types noted, the detection of a
cultural feature (Feature 1), and the presence of potentially intact subsurface deposits,
suggest that the resource has the possibility of yielding significant information regarding
the prehistory of southeast Texas.

CHAPTER VI. ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS

Following Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), any
federal undertaking must take into account its effect on historic resources, i.e.,
architectural or archaeological properties on or eligible for the NRHP. Once resources
are identified within the project’s area of potential effect (APE), they must be evaluated
for their National Register eligibility (Advisory Council for Historic Preservation 1999).
When an archaeological site has been discovered, a major goal associated with any
archaeological evaluation is to make recommendations concerning the eligibility of the
resource for the NRHP. Archaeological resources are most frequently evaluated for
eligibility in regard to Criterion D: information potential. For a site to be considered
eligible for the NRHP under Criterion D, it must possess information bearing on an
important scientific research question. Important research questions commonly involve
testing new or former hypotheses regarding topics in the natural sciences and/or
addressing aspects of the cultural chronology of a region. This information must be
evaluated within the framework of an historic context, meaning, the researcher must be
able to address how the information contained within the resource is likely to effect
current understanding of a particular time period (USDI 1983:II-26, 1991:21).
Site 41OR89 is identified as a long-term cultural utilization locus situated on a
landform that was once adjacent to the paleochannel of the Neches River. While the site
is relatively small, it produced an abundance of prehistoric pottery, a diagnostic lithic
arrow point, and an intact thermal feature (Feature 1). Excavations across the landform
indicate the site deposit is intact. Site 41OR89 may once have shared the same landform
as Site 41OR85, a nearby prehistoric site determined eligible for inclusion on the NRHP.
Site 41OR85 was recommended eligible based on its ability to provide information on the
poorly understood prehistory of the region, even though much of the site has been
compromised or destroyed by pipeline construction, no features were identified, and the
artifact yield was modest (57 ceramic sherds and 9 pieces of debitage). By contrast Site
41OR89 yielded cultural information that appears to have temporal analogs to the Clear
Lake (100-425 A.D.) through the Round Lake (1000-1350) periods, a relative abundance
of prehistoric artifacts (330 ceramic sherds, 6 debitage 1 diagnostic arrow point and
charcoal) as well as an intact thermal feature (Feature 1). Comparison studies between
41OR89 and adjacent National Register eligible site 41OR85 should prove highly
interesting, should the opportunity to investigate both sites arise.
Basic questions regarding occupation and cultural interaction at the present-day
Texas/Louisiana border have yet to be answered by researchers interested in
understanding cultural interaction and regional contact. Broad research themes that may
be addressed by investigations at 41OR89 relate to evidence in the archaeological record
of variation in this cultural interaction as represented by ceramic use, technology, and, if
present, evidence of pottery manufacture. Aten (1983) suggests that early ceramics of the

UTC “are derived from or share a common origin with those of the LMV”, while Story
(1990) has suggested that the Ceramic Period along the UTC is archaeologically distinct,
and that the ceramic assemblage in the region is associated with distinct ethnic and
linguistic groups of Early Historic times. This “Mossy Grove Tradition” exhibits noted
similarities to assemblages of coastal Louisiana (Perttula 2004; Story 1990). Obviously,
the cultural context and interaction of the area is poorly understood, and the ceramic
sequence at the Texas/Louisiana margin should help in developing an understanding of
cultural interactions in the region. Regional work suggests that there appears to be an
early link between coastal southeast Texas and Louisiana groups, as reflected in a
transition from Tchefuncte/Mandeville ceramics of the Tchula Period, to a relatively
locally inspired sandy paste Goose Creek ware, followed by grog tempered Coles
Creek/Plaquemine tradition wares.
Site 41OR89 appears to have the potential to yield data necessary to begin
addressing many of these basic questions. The Texas State Historic Preservation Office
(SHPO) in a letter dated August 24, 2007 concurred with the recommendation for NR
eligibility for Site 41OR89. As currently proposed, the Golden Pass Pipeline corridor
will pass approximately 8 meters (25 feet) from the southern edge of site. Measures have
been developed to protect the site in place from pipeline construction as concurred with
by the Texas SHPO (Appendix D). These measures involve the installation of chain link
fence on the north edge of the pipeline construction corridor in the proximity of the site
and the presence of an archaeological monitor during excavation within 30 meters (100
feet) of the southern boundary of the site.
