This is the somewhat arbitrary break commonly made between the long Archaic period and its successor, the Late Prehistoric. Previously this was referred to as the “Neo-American Stage” (D. Suhm et al. 1954, 20) in the expectation that all three defining traits (pottery, bow and arrow, and agriculture) would eventually be recognized. It now appears that generally for central Texas, only the bow and arrow appeared initially, pottery was added later, and agriculture (or, at least, the possession of tropical cultigens) came last and was of quite minor importance. Because basic hunting and gathering subsistence continued, what is here called the Late Prehistoric has also been labeled the “Neo-Archaic” (Prewitt 1981) or the “Post-Archaic” (L. Johnson and Goode 1994). Two subperiods, early and late (see Fig. 3.9), are here recognized in the Late Prehistoric (Jelks 1962); these correspond to the Austin and Toyah “phases” (I will continue to use the term “interval”) of long standing use in the systematics of the local prehistory (Prewitt 1981). More than projectile point style change distinguishes Austin from Toyah manifestations, and the subperiod level of designation is intended to reflect the importance of these differences. I agree with L. Johnson and Goode (1994, 39– 40) when they note that an equally satisfactory solution would be to place the break between the Archaic and the Late Prehistoric at ca. 800 B.P., when Toyah replaces Austin as the prevailing archeological configuration"" (p. 122).","","Neo-Archaic","Post-Archaic","Neo-American Stage","","","","","","","","","","","",""
