as no additional artifacts were found in the vicinity of the point, it was documented as an isolated occurrence.
due to land access restrictions, the survey efforts did not extend beyond the 30-foot-wide project corridor.
at this time, there is not enough evidence to connect the isolated point fragment to the nearby previously recorded site 41hy470.
based on the soils and geology of the project area, any archaeological sites would likely be confined to surface, or near surface contexts.
with this in mind, clearing and ranching activities, erosion, and floodwater events have substantially affected the integrity of any cultural resources within the project area.
