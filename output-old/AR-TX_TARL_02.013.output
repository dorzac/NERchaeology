FOUND Archaic
$$  15 meters in diameter with a maximum depth of 60 cm - small compared to the archaic stage middens farther up the road at site 41uv88 and at other sites along the river.
FOUND Late Prehistoric
$$  a substantial portion of the burned rock midden at 41uv86 has been tentatively attributed to the late prehistoric.
FOUND Archaic
$$ the midden may have had its beginnings toward the end of the archaic
FOUND Archaic
$$  but at this point there is insufficient evidence to confirm an archaic origin.
FOUND Archaic
$$ from 41uv86 a total of 27 dart points has been assigned to gross time periods of the archaic; 22 of these specimens were further identified by type.

$$ judging by the relative scarcity of the only diagnostic artifacts - projectile points - this was a minor campsite throughout the archaic.
