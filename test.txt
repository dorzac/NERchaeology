site 41HY470 was recommended as not eligible for
the NRHP (Yelacic and Lohse 2010).
An additional 17 archaeological sites, one NRHP
property, one cemetery, and six area surveys were
located within a 1-mile radius of the project area. The
17 previously recorded sites consist of five prehistoric open campsites (41HY92, 41HY147, 41HY160,
41HY182, and 41HY188), five prehistoric lithic scatters (41HY154, 41HY155, 41HY181, 41HY156, and
41HY157), one sink hole site (41HY311), one prehistoric open campsite with a burned rock midden
(41HY137), one multi-component site (41HY467),
two historic dump sites (41HY469 and 41HY471),
one historic-age homestead (41HY318), and one
historic-age lime kiln (41HY109). None of these
sites are within or immediately adjacent to the
project area. Of these sites, only site 41HY147 and
41HY160 are listed as SALs. The NRHP property
consists of the Burleson-Knispel House and is located approximately 0.41 mile north of the eastern
end of the project area. The San Marcos Cemetery
is located approximately 0.89 mile southwest of the
project area.
