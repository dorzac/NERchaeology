41ME89
Sitting in the northern portion of the project area this prehistoric site is a large, low,
domed burned rock midden. It is oval with the long axis running northwest to southeast.
Maximum dimensions visible from the surface are approximately 50 meters long by 24
meters wide. The subsurface extent of this large feature of burned rock is unknown at this
time. Some light amounts of debitage and other lithic materials are associated with this
site. As expected shovel testing in the center of the midden failed to provide information
of the subsurface extent of the feature. What was discovered is reported here.
A total of 35 pieces of debitage were recovered from the three shovel tests placed into the
center and edges of the midden. St1 yielded substantial amounts of burned rock and little
else as is typical of a feature made of burned rock. As it is so abundant the burned rock
was not collected. Six pieces of debitage were collected, however. Two flakes were
secondary and 4 tertiary. Core/platform production accounted for 2 and 4 battered flakes
were of an indeterminate type.
Shovel test 2 recovered 7 pieces of debitage, all tertiary flakes. Only one flake was of an
identifiable, being a biface manufacture flake.
Shovel test 3 was placed on the edge of the burned rock midden feature. In this location it
encountered fewer burned rock (still a significant amount) and yielded the most debitage
(n=22). 13.6% (n= 3) of the debitage were primary flakes, 27.3% (n=6) were secondary
and 59.1% (n=13) were tertiary. In looking at the flake production types biface
manufacture accounts for 5 flakes, as does core/platform preparation. Indeterminate
flakes make up the remaining 12 lithics.

41ME91
41ME91 is a board and batten house with an attached porch and one stone exterior wall.
Named after previous owners, it is known as the Fritz Weber House. The condition of the
house is excellent, being well maintained as a functional guesthouse with modern
plumbing and electricity that does not detract from the structureâ€™s historic character. The
site, on the northern side of the project area and immediately adjacent to 41ME89,
includes the house, the remains of a fence in front of it, and an unspecific area of yard
around it. Prehistoric lithics have been found in the yard around the house representing an
earlier occupation. Being only a few steps from 41ME89 such prehistoric materials may
be associated with that midden.
No shovel testing was done at the Old Weber House, instead photo documentation was
conducted and architectural illustrations were made. The home has been well researched
and documented. The Frosts who owned the property in 1997-99 restored the Old Weber
house. When removing an old fence they discovered Frio and Ensor points. This places
the prehistoric occupation in the Transitional Archaic (Hester personal communication
2003).
41ME92
This site was first identified by a small burned rock midden sitting on the fence line next
to the county road, which cuts through a portion of it. The off-midden extent of the site is
a mostly buried deposit of late prehistoric ceramics and lithics that continues along the
roadside fence at least up to the modern driveway that runs from the county road to the
main house. These were identified in trenching done to help protect oak trees in the area
from getting oak wilt through the roots. The full extent and density of the site is unknown
as is the relationship between the midden and the off-midden deposits.
Shovel testing at this site took place well to the north of the midden. Shovel test 1
encountered only burned rock and road gravel. Shovel test 2 yielded 19 pieces of

20

debitage, 7 of which were secondary flakes and 11 tertiary. Biface manufacture accounts
for 4 flakes while 6 were core/platform preparation and 9 were of an indeterminate type.
Shovel test 3 recovered 9 pieces of debitage and an arrow point. The debitage included 3
secondary flakes and 6 tertiary. Biface manufacture, core/platform preparation and
indeterminate flakes each accounted for 3 debitage (totaling 9). The single arrow point is
a blade only, with indications of a tip, stem and barbs being broken away. The type is not
identifiable from the fragment present (see Table 3 for metric details).
